"ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: 11-year-old male with worsening respiratory symptoms, weight loss, and cervical lymphadenopathy. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with respiratory distress, hypoxaemia, and cervical lymphadenopathy. A chest roentgenogram showed bilateral diffuse micronodular opacities. Thorough microbiological investigation failed to demonstrate Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tissue was obtained from one of the enlarged cervical lymph nodes, and histopathology of the core biopsy showed focal involvement by metastatic carcinoma demonstrating papillary-cystic growth with scattered solid islands and psammoma bodies. The neoplastic cells displayed nuclear enlargement with irregular nuclear membranes, nuclear overlap, and ""Orphan Annie eye"" nuclear inclusions. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positivity with cytokeratin (CK) 7, thyroid transcription factor 1, and thyroglobulin, supporting the pathological diagnosis of metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Further clinical examination revealed an ill-defined 2.5 x 1.5 cm left thyroid nodule. Ultrasonography confirmed a heterogeneous left thyroid nodule with internal calcifications. The chest roentgenogram findings were reviewed to now include carcinomatosis of the lung. Uncontrasted MRI of the mediastinum and neck revealed a lobulated, predominantly solid thyroid mass that returned heterogeneous T2 high signal and T1 low signal, with associated extensive bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Total thyroidectomy with central and modified left cervical lymph node dissection was performed. Pathological evaluation of the resection specimen revealed extensive multifocal involvement by PTC, with extrathyroidal extension and widespread involvement of cervical lymph nodes. Seven out of 9 nodes in the central compartment were positive, and 15 out of 59 nodes were positive in the lateral compartment. Immunohistochemistry for BRAFV600E was negative. POST-ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary and cervical lymph node involvement. HOSPITAL COURSE: Postoperative calcium-phosphate metabolism was normal, and the patient did not experience any further adverse events. Postoperative levothyroxine was initiated because of the hiatus in receiving radioactive iodine therapy for the metastatic lung disease. Prior to initiation of thyroid hormone replacement, a whole-body diagnostic I-131 scan revealed extensive uptake of iodine in the lungs bilaterally.

"Hospital Course: The patient was admitted with symptomatic recurrence of a solitary plasmacytoma of the left scapula that had previously recurred multiple times despite multiple treatment modalities. The patient was initially treated with local radiation therapy and was subsequently treated with multiple cycles of combination chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. The patient's disease did not go into full remission, and the patient complained of significant pain and restricted movement of the upper limb. Diagnostic Assessment: Computed tomography (CT) and MRI scans showed a multifocal tumor in the left scapula that extended into the axilla, making surgical resection impossible. Angiography revealed that the lesion was well vascularized. The tumor vessels were embolized to stasis using Trans-arterial embolization (TAE) in two sessions. Intravenous pethidine was administered for analgesia. The platelet count was 161 K at the time of the procedure. The baseline and the consecutive MRI examinations were performed on a 3 T Philips Achieva scanner using DWIBS and contrast-enhanced sequences.

She had been experiencing linear, hyperpigmented macules on both legs with foci of scarring and ulceration. On physical examination, it was observed that she had livedoid vasculopathy. Following biopsy, it was found that she also had an elevated antithrombin 3 activity that was suggestive of an underlying prothrombotic component to the condition. Alternate treatments were considered for the patient since she refused anticoagulant therapy due to her husband‚Äôs previously reported diet restrictions and INR monitoring mandated by the use of warfarin. At that time, treatment was started with oral dapsone 100 mg once daily and prednisone 10 mg once daily. She achieved intermittent remission of her LV for several years. In the fall of 2018, she began having intermittent painful flares of her LV which were managed by increasing her dapsone to 150 mg once daily and increasing her prednisone to 20 mg. The patient sometimes required burst doses of 60 mg once daily. In 2018, she was hospitalized due to severe hyperglycemic episodes and her insulin delivery was switched to a pump system. The patient was then started on warfarin 1 mg once daily. During the acute flare of LV, the patient presented an erythematous papule at the right dorsal forearm which was diagnosed as a disseminated cutaneous mycobacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium Abscessus/Chelonae. Following the biopsy report, susceptibility testing was performed, and it was found that the bacteria were resistant to cefoxitin, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. She was prescribed a treatment regimen of oral azithromycin, intravenous imipenem, and intravenous amikacin. This regimen was initially set to continue for a total of 8-12 weeks depending on her response, followed by oral azithromycin monotherapy for at least an additional 6 months. Lifelong suppression with oral monotherapy is also being considered pending her clinical response and tolerance to azithromycin. At 10 weeks of treatment her physical exam revealed improvement of the ulcers of the right forearm, right thigh, and left foot. However, she also developed three new left knee ulcers consistent in appearance with her other mycobacterial lesions, and her current regimen is to be continued until her follow-up appointment for PICC line removal at 17 weeks of treatment.

"Hospital Course Summary: Admission Date: 2018-XX-XX Discharge Date: 2018-XX-XX Reason for Admission: A 9-year-old male patient was admitted to Loghman Hospital, Tehran, Iran in 2018, presenting with speech regression, seizure, and ataxia. Medical History: The patient was developmentally normal until he was 4 years old, when he began experiencing behavioral disturbances including attention deficit, auditory agnosia, decreased verbal communication, speech repetition, and IQ deterioration. At 6 years old, he had his first episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure with upward gaze and jaw locking during sleep, as well as intermittent urinary incontinence. The child subsequently developed symptoms of autism spectrum disorder such as echolalia, poor eye-to-eye contact, and repetitive behavior. Physical Examination: On neurological examination, the patient had no focal signs. Motor and sensory examination of four extremities were intact. Diagnostic Testing: Primary laboratory studies performed, including blood cell count, and renal and liver function tests were normal. CSF examination was within normal limits. Brain MRI and auditory brainstem response (ABR) showed normal results. Brain perfusion SPECT showed decreased perfusion in the left centrotemporal lobe. Amplitude EEG showed bilateral synchronous spike-wave complex in the temporal regions. Diagnosis: On the basis of presentation, EEG, and SPECT study, the patient was diagnosed with LKS (Landau-Kleffner Syndrome) and treatment with methylprednisolone, valproate sodium, levetiracetam, IVIG, and speech therapy was initiated. However, the patient continued to experience generalized tonic-clonic seizure in sleep, severe behavioral disorders, and aphasia. Due to poor response to treatment, progression of symptoms, and relative parent concerns, whole exome sequencing was performed, revealing a mutation in exon 5 of NAGLU gene suggesting MPS IIIB.

"Hospital Course: The 2-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with seizures that were left focal as well as generalized tonic-clonic. Despite being treated with phenobarbitone, levetiracetam, diphenylhydantoin, sodium valproate, steroids, and ACTH, the seizures were not controlled. The child was diagnosed with primary uncontrolled epilepsy with catastrophic epileptic encephalopathy. Routine investigations were negative except for a mild increase in succinic acid, adipic acid, and ethylmalonic acid in the urine chromatogram. Diagnostic Assessment: Cerebrospinal fluid studies were normal. EEG showed diffuse delta activity, while the computed tomography scan of the brain showed diffuse atrophy but with relative sparing of the cerebellum. A family history of 1st-day convulsions in the elder child who had a similar presentation and died at the age of 1 year made us suspect pyridoxine-dependent convulsions. An intravenous pyridoxine test was positive, as the delta background reverted to beta after the administration of 100 mg of intravenous pyridoxine. Management and Treatment: Lysine-free diet, 100 mg of oral pyridoxine hydrochloride with 150 mg of arginine, and 10 mg of folic acid were initiated in addition to clobazam. The child became seizure-free in 10 days. Discharge Summary: After 6 months, the child was standing with support and vocalizing. At 2-year follow-up, he was walking independently, able to communicate in small sentences, toilet trained but had mild features of attention-deficit hyperactivity. Given the positive response to the pyridoxine test, the child was suspected and ultimately diagnosed with pyridoxine-dependent convulsions.

Hospital Course Summary: The patient presented to the ED with complaints of resolved left-sided facial droop and a lingering paresthesia of her left upper extremity. She reported that her symptoms began while she was aboard a flight across the country, approximately six hours prior to arrival to the ED. She experienced sudden, severe left ear pain and felt left-sided facial as well as left upper extremity numbness. Her symptoms resolved within approximately 30 minutes, although her ear pain remained. On exam in the ED, her initial vital signs were within normal limits, and her neurologic exam was completely normal. Her National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was zero. Routine laboratory data was unremarkable, however, computed tomography (CT) was notable for small foci of air in the subdural space scattered along the left aspect of the outside of the superior sagittal sinus. Her transient facial droop was attributed to an air pocket near the facial nerve that would have expanded with cabin pressure change, but had since been reabsorbed and therefore was not captured on imaging at the time of the patient‚Äôs presentation in the ED.

"Discharge Summary Patient Overview: The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of opioid use for four years. The patient had been using smoked heroin on a daily basis before starting opioid agonist therapy with PRB, which helped him successfully quit using heroin. History and Diagnosis: The patient's substance use began with the use of prescribed codeine for a knee injury. After continuously using opioids, heroin use became problematic and started to impact the patient's work and relationships. The patient attempted multiple times to stop using opioids with no success. The patient was apprehensive about starting any form of therapy due to fear of withdrawal symptoms. A medical assessment was completed during which a urine drug screen showed possible morphine use. A treatment plan was agreed with the patient starting with sublingual buprenorphine. The patient later switched to monthly injections of PRB. The patient's drug screening during PRB therapy remained negative. Hospital Course: The patient's initial therapy with sublingual buprenorphine required daily appointments, which were challenging to maintain due to the patient's demanding work life. Upon switching to PRB therapy, the patient no longer needed daily appointments and entered into monthly treatment and continued the therapy for 12 consecutive months. Patient Outcomes: Patient-reported outcomes for the first patient following three months of monthly PRB are favorable. The patient reported mild opioid withdrawal symptoms for three days, after which they settled with time. The patient stabilized physically and mentally with no opioid withdrawal symptoms, no cravings, and ceased use of opioid and other drugs. Self-care improved as the patient started daily exercise, yoga, and meditation. Work and relationships managed to improve with new successes in business being reported.

A bone density scan revealed osteoporosis, confirmed by low T-scores at several sites. The patient had low body weight and was post-menopausal, but no other risk factors for osteoporosis were identified. There was no significant family history of the condition. The patient had normal levels of calcium, phosphate, PTH, and vitamin D, but her serum ALP was low, raising the possibility of HPP. Her pyridoxal 5'-phosphate level was high, supporting the diagnosis. Gene sequencing confirmed heterozygosity for a deletion-insertion mutation in the ALPL gene, previously linked to fatal perinatal HPP. Hospital Course: During the hospital stay, a trans-iliac bone biopsy was performed to determine if there was evidence of osteomalacia. The biopsy showed osteopenia in the trabecular bone, with reduced bone volume and slender trabeculae. The cortex was of normal thickness, with a mild increase in porosity. No hyperosteoidosis was observed. Discharge: The patient‚Äôs condition has been thoroughly assessed during the hospital stay, and the diagnosis of HPP has been confirmed based on low serum ALP and high pyridoxal 5'-phosphate levels, along with heterozygosity for a known ALPL gene mutation. The patient will require long-term monitoring and management of this condition. Further management will include the management of her osteoporosis with appropriate medications and follow up testing as appropriate. Follow-up: The patient should be followed up with close monitoring of her bone density and ALP levels.

"DISCHARGE SUMMARY Patient Name: [REDACTED] Medical Record No.: [REDACTED] Hospital Course: The patient was referred to our endocrinology department to evaluate a left adrenal mass discovered during a CT scan. The patient had a history of ureteral stones and hypertension treated with amlodipine. No clinical features of Cushing's syndrome were found on physical examination, but the patient's blood pressure levels were not well controlled under amlodipine. Laboratory examinations revealed normal values of 24-hour urine metanephrines/normetanephrine, plasma renin, and plasma aldosterone concentration. The patient's midnight cortisol and urine free cortisol levels were elevated, and her plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration was at the low limit. A CT scan revealed a suspicious left adrenal mass. The patient underwent laparoscopic retroperitoneal cystic resection and left partial adrenalectomy. Pathological analysis demonstrated an endothelial cyst with an adrenocortical adenoma. At three months after surgery, the patient's weight decreased, hypertension stabilized under amlodipine, and plasma cortisol concentration decreased compared to preoperative levels. Testing showed an increase in plasma 8 am ACTH concentration and suppression of plasma cortisol concentration in reaction to the overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test. Discharge Diagnosis: Suspicious left adrenal mass, endothelial cyst, and adrenocortical adenoma. Discharge Condition: Stable, with no signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.

Admission Date: [not provided] Discharge Date: [not applicable] Admitting Diagnosis: Incidentally diagnosed right neck cystic mass after motor vehicle accident. Hospital Course: The patient was admitted with a right neck cystic mass incidentally found on CT imaging after a motor vehicle accident. Physical exam revealed a tender right-sided neck mass, without any other significant findings. Biopsy of the neck mass reported well-differentiated papillary carcinoma within lymph node tissue. Total thyroidectomy with right neck dissection was performed to investigate the possibility of occult primary carcinoma of the thyroid, with normal thyroid gland and without lymph node metastasis noted on histopathological examination. Postoperative evaluation revealed functional thyroid tissue remnants at the right thyroid bed, with hypoechoic foci likely secondary to postsurgical granulation tissue versus residual thyroid tissue. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the nodules showed papillary thyroid carcinoma, with whole-body scan showing functional thyroid tissue remnants in the thyroid bed and multiple enlarged neck lymph nodes. Appropriate cessation of hormone replacement therapy and radioiodine ablation were performed, with post-treatment whole-body scan showing no nodular uptake. The patient was referred to nuclear medicine for radioiodine therapy, and hormone replacement therapy was started after surgery. Thyroglobulin levels were monitored with a one-month follow-up, which was found to be elevated with an increased level of TSH, prompting radioiodine ablation in 142.2 mCi.

"Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the hospital with acute symptoms of gastrointestinal tract, which deteriorated rapidly with new-onset neurological symptoms and an acute episode of PTE. The patient had a medical history of recurring lower limb thrombophlebitis for the past six months, treated conservatively, resulting in two prior episodes of PTE. Summary of Events: The patient was referred for autopsy to the General and Clinical Pathology department after he passed away. Upon autopsy, a massive PTE was established, with multiple thrombi in the venous vessels. The gastrointestinal tract showed severe gas dilatation of the small intestine and colon with hyperemia in the mucosa across the stomach, small, and large intestine. The pancreas had severe gross changes suggestive of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The central nervous system section revealed a massive hemorrhage on the left cerebral hemisphere and a lesion, measuring 2/2.4 cm in the left occipital lobe, sharply demarcated from the surrounding brain tissue. Other gross changes included several thickened zones in the peritoneum, pleura and pericardium, and more than 20 calculi in the urinary bladder. Histology Results: The histology from the pancreas revealed atypical glandular structures, with invasion into vascular structures and the surrounding adiposa and metastasis to regional lymph nodes. Histology from the venous vessels of the abdomen showed an abundance of mixed thrombi. Histology of the lungs revealed an abundance of thrombi, some with organization, and cellular emboli in the vascular tree.

"Discharge Summary: Patient Name: JS 31 Gender: Male Age: Over 30 years old Chief Complaint: JS 31 underwent an assessment of his skeletal remains, which revealed various projectile impact marks (PIMs) and healing fractures. Hospital Course Summary: JS 31 was assessed for injuries and projectile impact marks (PIMs) based on his heavy dental wear and bone remodeling. Seventeen lithic artefacts were found in association with his skeletal remains, with two embedded in the bone and fifteen within the physical space of the body. Unfortunately, these bones are not part of the collection donated to the British Museum. Among the PIMs found were various healed and unhealed projectile impact marks, including a puncture with crushing, faulting and flaking of the bone surface on the anterior part of the left scapula, a deep V-shaped drag (2 cm long) on the posterior-medial side of the humerus, and a healed fracture of the distal extremity of the right first metacarpal. Assessment and Findings: JS 31's PIMs also included previously unidentified healed lesions that were most probably the result of earlier interpersonal injuries. The new unhealed PIMs identified were located on the infra-cranial skeleton and include a puncture with crushing, faulting and flaking of the bone surface on the anterior part of the left scapula and a deep V-shaped drag (2 cm long) on the posterior-medial side of the humerus. JS 31 also has a healed fracture of the distal extremity of the right first metacarpal. Finally, the right femur offers further evidence of healed lesions, with the presence of a bone callus on the lateral side of the proximal part of the shaft and of a healed projectile wound on the anterior side at midshaft. Three previously unidentified embedded lithic chips were found trapped in the healing bulge of the latter. Summary: JS 31 underwent an assessment that revealed previously unidentified healed and unhealed projectile impact marks, as well as healed lesions that are most probably the result of earlier interpersonal injuries.

"Discharge Summary: Patient Name: [redacted] Sex: Male Age: 33 Medical Record Number: [redacted] Admission Date: [redacted] Discharge Date: [redacted] Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to our hospital following a fall from a height of 10 m while working on a factory roof. The patient suffered multiple injuries including contusions of the liver and lung and fractures of the scapulae and pelvis. Radiological examinations, including cervical X-ray analysis and computed tomography (CT), revealed translocation of both occipital condyles and compression of the spinal cord by a hematoma. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed stretched internal carotid and vertebral arteries due to a distraction between the atlas and occiput. On the day of admission, the patient underwent interventional embolization to achieve hemostasis in the contused organs and was fitted with a hard collar. On the second day, a halo orthosis was fitted to augment cervical immobilization. The patient gradually regained consciousness, but exhibited severe motor weakness with a manual muscle test (MMT) score of 0/5 for the whole body except the bilateral toes, which retained their flexion and extension and had a MMT score of 4/5. On the third day, the patient's MMT score decreased to 1/5 for the right toe. C3-4 laminectomy and hematoma removal were performed, during which the right C4 and 5 nerve roots were found to be severely avulsed. After surgery, the patient experienced drowsiness and progressive abducens nerve palsy. To address the patient's progressive abducens nerve palsy, we monitored the cerebral regional saturation of oxygen (rSO2) and adjusted the halo vest twice using vertical compressive force to the head. This succeeded in reducing the exacerbation of the AOD and improving the patient's level of consciousness. On the 16th day, we performed an occipito-axial posterior fixation to correct the wide atlanto-occipital gap. Adequate curettage and bone grafting were performed, and C2 pedicle screws and an occipital plate were placed. Following surgery, a hard collar was substituted for the halo. Outcome: The patient was able to walk without support within two months. Although he retained right proximal upper limb motor weakness, he eventually fully regained the ability to perform activities of daily living. Additionally, the abducens nerve palsy completely resolved. Condition at the Time of Discharge: The patient was stable and able to manage activities of daily living with the assistance of his family. We scheduled follow-up appointments with the neurosurgery department for further evaluation and management of his residual symptoms. Discharge Medications: No medications were prescribed at the time of discharge. Follow-up Plan: The patient was referred for follow-up appointments with the neurosurgery department for additional evaluation and management of his residual symptoms. Instructions Provided to Patient: The patient was advised to avoid any strenuous activity and continue to wear the hard collar for additional four weeks.

"Subjective: A 16-year-old male presented with a six-month history of low back pain radiating to the left lower limb, progressive weakness of both lower limbs for two months, and hesitancy of micturition for one month. There was no history of trauma, fever, or bowel incontinence. Objective: Physical examination revealed lower motor neuron weakness in both lower limbs with sluggish deep tendon reflexes. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a dumbbell-shaped tumor occupying the spinal canal and extending into the retroperitoneal space through the left intervertebral foramen between L3 and L4. Radiological diagnosis of a lumbar dumb-bell shaped neurinoma with necrosis was made. Assessment: Based on findings, a clinical diagnosis of cauda-conus lesion was made. Plan: The patient underwent one-stage transparaspinal removal of tumor after being counseled about the operative procedure. The risk of neurological deficit from nerve root sacrifice was discussed with the patient and his relatives, along with the possibility of incomplete resection and the possibility of subsequent anterior surgery. Procedure: The patient underwent surgery after induction of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. The tumor was identified and removed using microsurgical techniques. Sacrifice of a functioning nerve root was necessary, and the rootlets were excised in toto along with attached dura. Attention was then directed toward the extra-canalicular component. Once a generous internal decompression was accomplished, the capsule of the tumor was mobilized and completely dissected. Dura was closed in a water-tight fashion, paraspinal muscles were approximated with interrupted sutures, and unilateral fixation bridging the removed facet was performed using transpedicular rods and screws. Postoperative CT scan revealed complete excision. Outcome: Patient was discharged on 8th postoperative day and was doing well at first follow-up visit at 1 month.

"Discharge Summary Patient Name: [redacted] Sex: Male Date of Admission: [redacted] Date of Discharge: [redacted] Admitting Diagnosis: Dorsal curvature of the penis Discharge Diagnosis: Dorsal curvature of the penis with ossification of the tunica albuginea Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the urology department with a stable, eight-year history of dorsal curvature of the penis with erections. The patient had a near 90-degree curvature, which was refractory to in-office verapamil injections. The patient was able to obtain erections, but they were painful and bothersome. Sexual intercourse was difficult and painful for both the patient and his partner due to the curvature. The patient's medical and surgical history was unremarkable. On physical examination, the penis was uncircumcised with a palpable, firm plaque along the dorsal midshaft measuring approximately 2.5 cm by 1.5 cm. A penile Doppler ultrasound was obtained, which demonstrated a broad, linear, sheet-like densification of the dorsal tunica albuginea extending from the base of the penis along most of the shaft, predominantly along the right side. Due to the extensive degree of plaque and the impact on his quality of life, the patient was taken to the operating room for partial excision and grafting. Intraoperatively, the large, firm ossified plaque was immediately apparent, and care was taken to excise this while preserving the neurovascular bundles. The corporal defect was closed using a bovine pericardial graft (Coloplast, Minneapolis, MN). Upon intraoperative induction of an artificial erection, the partial curvature was still apparent, necessitating placement of two tunica albuginea plication sutures along the ventral shaft. Curvature was corrected to 10 degrees dorsally at the end of the procedure. The remainder of his hospital course was unremarkable, and he was discharged home the same day. Follow-up: The patient had no complications post-operatively, with minimal residual curvature noted at the two-month follow-up. The patient denied any erectile dysfunction and was able to obtain satisfactory erections without medications. The patient is sexually active with his partner and denies pain or difficulty with intercourse. Pathology: Macroscopic examination of the excised tissue revealed multiple tan-white, elongated segments of glistening tissue with central areas of calcification measuring in aggregate 3.2 cm by 1.6 cm by 1.1 cm. The tissue was examined after decalcification. The histologic sections demonstrated a centrally located bony tissue surrounded by penile fibrous tissue. The bony tissue showed features of lamellar bone under polarized light. No inflammation was present within the lamellar bone and adjacent fibrous tissue. Discharge Medications: None.

Following consumption, he had several episodes of vomiting. Subsequently, he developed twitching movements of his limbs, urinary incontinence, and altered sensorium. On examination, he was stuporous with a systolic blood pressure of 80 mm of Hg, a heart rate of 120/min, and a respiratory rate of 32/min. He was documented to have hypoxia with a pulse oximetry saturation of 70%. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated due to altered sensorium and hypoxia. A gastric lavage was administered followed by a single dose of activated charcoal instilled through the nasogastric tube. The provisional diagnosis made in the emergency department was of an organophosphate poisoning with acute cholinergic syndrome. The chest X-ray was normal, and ECG revealed sinus tachycardia. Basic blood investigations including serum electrolytes, creatinine, liver function tests, and complete blood counts were normal. The serum pseudo-cholinesterase level was normal (3839 U/l). The patient was admitted into the semi-intensive care unit and managed conservatively with fluids and cardiac monitoring.

"Hospital Course: The patient, a 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history, was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment of bilateral pneumonia that required prolonged mechanical ventilation via a tracheostomy. The patient further developed necrotizing pneumonia and subsequently multiorgan failure that led to hospitalization for 6 weeks. Pleural Pigtail Chest Tube Procedure: During the hospitalization, the patient underwent a pleural pigtail chest tube placement procedure to relieve a small pneumothorax that was detected on CXR. The procedure was complicated by sudden unresponsiveness and an episode of apnea. The patient's vitals remained stable, and a subsequent CXR did not show worsening of the existing pneumothorax. However, urgent CT scan of the head showed low-density opacities that are consistent with air embolism that led to large bilateral cerebral infarcts, greater on the right, and also infarcts developing within the pons and midbrain. Treatment and Clinical Course: The patient was returned to mechanical ventilation with assist control mode on a high oxygen flow. The patient was treated conservatively with a Trendelenburg position, and a follow-up CTA of the head and neck showed that the air embolism had resolved.

"Discharge Summary: Patient Name: Not specified Gender: Female Age: 88 years Diagnoses: - Severe aortic stenosis - Hypertension - Dyslipidaemia - NYHA class III shortness of breath - Class 4 clinical frailty Hospital Course: The patient was diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and admitted to the hospital for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). Pre-procedural computed tomography showed a sufficiently large aortic root size and no massive calcification. A 26-mm Evolut R valve was chosen for the procedure due to the patient's age and frailty. During the TAVI procedure, resistance was encountered during the attempted removal of the Device Sheath (DS) of the ERV. Wire manipulation was attempted to safely remove the DS-ERV, but the ERV embolized to the ascending aorta while the DS-ERV was being removed from the ERV. The patient underwent emergency intubation and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) was percutaneously introduced as a precaution. The ERV was repositioned to the ascending aorta with an EN Snare, but resistance was again felt when attempting to remove the DS-ERV from the second ERV. A subsequent attempt at TAVI with a 23-mm SAPIEN 3 valve was successful with slight under-filling following pre-dilation with a 20-mm balloon. On the day after the second TAVI procedure, the V-A ECMO was removed and the patient was extubated. Single antiplatelet therapy using clopidogrel was initiated. The patient was discharged to home 9 days after the TAVI procedure without further complications.

However, after one month, the conjunctival lesion and pigmentation worsened. Follow-up: The treatment was then switched to topical 0.05% epinastine and topical 0.1% tacrolimus, and after one month of treatment, the patient showed significant improvement. The conjunctival lesion was markedly reduced, and the pigmentation was barely visible. Summary: The patient was admitted with severe hyperemia and pigmented lesion in the right eye due to atopic dermatitis and complications of allergic conjunctivitis. The initial treatment with betamethasone was ineffective, and the patient was switched to epinastine and fluorometholone, which further worsened the condition.

"Hospital Course: The patient, a 64-year-old male, presented with toothache and loose tooth #13 and #14 about one month ago. The dental pain was intermittent, and he did not seek medical attention until he experienced spontaneous pus discharge in the right alar groove area and upper alveolar area three weeks before the visit to our hospital. The patient was diagnosed with odontogenic fistula and underwent a debridement, tooth extraction, and fistulectomy with biopsy at a dental department. Findings: The biopsy results revealed basal cell carcinoma and inflamed granulation tissue with a fistula. However, no clear correlation between the fistula and skin cancer was observed in the pathologic findings. Nonetheless, there was a doubt about basal cell carcinoma, which is nearby the fistula. Further, a positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan conducted to confirm any possible metastasis of cancer revealed hypermetabolic lesions in the right paranasal skin and subcutaneous layer. Treatment: The patient underwent a wide excision surgery to treat a wound in the right nasal alar area, which included a 0.5 cm sized safety margin.

"DISCHARGE SUMMARY: Patient Name: [REDACTED] Age: 15 years Gender: Female Date of Admission: [REDACTED] Date of Discharge: [REDACTED] Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the Department of Orthodontics with the chief complaint of a malpositioned upper left tooth. A clinical examination revealed a symmetrical mesoprosopic face, convex profile, and prominent nose. Intraoral examination revealed a Class I canine relation on the right side, buccally blocked canine on the left side, Class I molar relation on the right side, and Class II molar relation on the left. Anteriorly, the overbite was in an edge to edge relation. The patient had bilateral posterior crossbite with respect to the first molars. The initial treatment plan involved unilateral first premolar extractions, alignment of the dentition into the arches, and correction of bilateral posterior crossbite. Treatment: The patient received preadjusted edgewise MBT.022 slot brackets in both arches, and initial alignment was done using 016 NiTi wire. A NiTi expander was inserted for correction of posterior crossbite. An archwire sequence of 018 NiTi, 016 √ó 022 NiTi, and 017 √ó 025 NiTi was followed. Extraction of maxillary right first premolar and mandibular right first premolar were performed, followed by placement of an open coil spring with respect to the blocked out canine for space creation and midline correction in the maxillary arch. After sufficient space had been created, the left maxillary canine was bonded and aligned within the arch using active lacebacks. Mandibular left canine was retracted into the extraction space using closed coil spring. An ideal Class I occlusion was achieved in the patient with a positive overjet and overbite. Bracket repositioning was done and 014 NiTi wires were used for final finishing and detailing. Results: The patient's smile appearance and esthetic profile improved after the treatment, and an ideal Class I occlusion was achieved with a positive overjet and overbite. The post-treatment Orthopantomogram showed ideal mesiodistal angulations of the dentition.

She reported a flu-like syndrome 10 days prior to the appearance of visual blurring. An extensive neurologic examination was performed, which yielded negative results. Best-corrected visual acuity in the left eye was 20/32. The color fundus photography of the left eye revealed a yellowish hypopigmented area in the macula. Autofluorescence measurement and fluorescein angiography were normal. B-scan SD-OCT revealed a disruption of the inner band of retinal pigment epithelium and IS/OS junction. Further, OCT showed small hyperreflective deposits between the IS/OS junction and the outer nuclear layer. Around this disrupted foveal area, IS/OS junction thickening could be observed as a fusion between the IS/OS junction and the RPE inner band. The late phases of ICGA revealed a hypofluorescent lesion with a hyperfluorescent halo with a cockade-like appearance. ‚ÄúEn face‚Äù OCT scan at the level of the IS/OS junction demonstrated a hyperreflective halo surrounding the hyporeflective fovea.

"Discharge Summary: Patient Name: Confidential MRN: Confidential Age: 47 years old Chief Complaint: Nasolabial folds treatment Hospital Course: The patient received a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) injection with a 22 G microcannula in the nasolabial folds area to treat facial wrinkles. During the procedure, the patient reported discomfort and moved abruptly, and a retrograde injection of 0.4 mL of PMMA was administered. The patient developed edema, hematoma, and ischemia in the right buccal mucosa and surrounding skin soon after the injection. The protocol for the treatment of occlusion included severe massage, hot compresses, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 300 mg, prednisone 20 mg, and prophylactic antibiotics, started immediately at the clinic. The patient was observed in the clinic for approximately one hour, prescribed antibiotics and sent home. On the second day after the procedure, the patient reported an improvement in edema, but on the third day, the patient developed pustules, and ischemia and hyperemia were observed in the nasolabial fold, nasal ala, and surrounding skin of the angular branch of the facial artery. Oxygen therapy in a hyperbaric chamber was initiated with 2.4 atm pressure for 90 minutes, daily for seven days, to treat the arterial occlusion. The patient showed significant improvement between each session of the hyperbaric chamber, and the doctors observed a total recovery within five sessions (on the eighth day after the procedure). The patient underwent two more sessions as recommended by the doctor at the oxygen therapy service, and the treatment was considered successful due to the reversal of the arterial occlusion and full restoration of the affected skin and tissues. Follow-up: The patient is advised to follow up with their primary care physician and report any abnormal skin or tissue changes and, should consider avoiding non-standardized or alternative therapies as complications may arise.",What was the cause of the arterial occlusion and subsequent skin and tissue damage observed in the patient's nasolabial folds area?,"The arterial occlusion and subsequent skin and tissue damage observed in the patient's nasolabial folds area were a result of a retrograde injection of PMMA, which is a filler used for facial wrinkles treatment.",5,Relation Extraction,"The cause of the arterial occlusion and subsequent skin and tissue damage observed in the patient's nasolabial folds area was likely due to trauma sustained from a button, which led to blister formation and subsequent skin breakdown, resulting in erythema and de-epithelialization in that region.",0.8952570557594299
"Patient Presentation: An 11-year-old male was referred for an orthodontic assessment due to mild class II division 2 malocclusion with an overjet of 2 mm and complete tooth overbite. He had fair oral hygiene and showed signs of occlusal fissure caries in both lower first permanent molars. There was also an absence of both lower permanent lateral incisors and upper permanent canines. Assessment and Treatment: The lower arch was well-aligned and aesthetically pleasing despite congenitally absent lower lateral incisors. The upper arch, however, was severely crowded with a lack of space for the missing canines. A dental pantomogram revealed the presence of all permanent teeth except for the LL2 and LR2. An inverted conical supernumerary was also found in the maxillary midline close to the root apices of the UR1 and UR2. The patient was advised to improve his oral hygiene and follow a healthy diet plan. Preventive resin restorations were planned for all four first permanent molars. Removal of the maxillary first premolars was requested to allow spontaneous eruption of the maxillary permanent canines. A fixed appliance therapy may be required in the future after the removal of the supernumerary. Summary: An 11-year-old male was referred for an orthodontic assessment due to mild class II division 2 malocclusion with crowding and overjet of 2 mm. The patient was counselled on oral hygiene and diet. Preventive resin restorations were done, and removal of maxillary first premolars was requested to allow spontaneous eruption of the maxillary permanent canines. A fixed appliance therapy may be required in the future once the supernumerary is removed.","What is the relation between the absence of lower permanent lateral incisors and upper permanent canines, and the severe crowding in the patient's upper arch?",The severe crowding in the patient's upper arch is related to the absence of both upper permanent canines and the lack of space for their eruption.,5,Relation Extraction,"The absence of lower permanent lateral incisors and upper permanent canines contributes to the severe crowding in the patient's upper arch by creating a lack of space for the remaining teeth. The missing canines prevent proper alignment and positioning of the adjacent teeth, leading to overcrowding as the other teeth shift to fill the available space. This misalignment exacerbates the crowding issue, as the upper arch becomes constricted without the presence of these key teeth.",0.8802857398986816

"Discharge Summary Patient Name: [Name] Date of Admission: [Date of Admission] Date of Discharge: [Date of Discharge] History and Reason for Admission: The 55-year-old female patient presented with swelling on the left side of her face that persisted for 6 months. The swelling extended from the malar region up to the inferior border of the mandible on the left side, causing gross facial asymmetry with considerable trismus. There were no associated symptoms, and her medical history was noncontributory. Dental history revealed multiple uneventful visits for extraction of teeth 5 years prior. Hospital Course Summary: Upon admission, the patient underwent a series of radiographic tests, including conventional extraoral film radiographs, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast. These tests revealed a well-defined, irregular-shaped soft-tissue mass with central necrosis in the left masticator space, involving the left masseter and buccal spaces along with pterygoid muscles, erosion of the ramus of the mandible, and destruction of the alveolar process of maxilla distal to 26. The mass also destroyed the superior alveolar margin and bony confinement of the left maxillary sinus anteriorly, compressed the left maxillary antrum with smooth scalloping of its wall, and partly eroded the zygoma. The mass was hypointense on T1W and showed areas of heterogeneous enhancement on T2W images, suggestive of schwannoma. Treatment and Response: The patient underwent successful surgical resection of the mass under general anesthesia. The histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma, with intensely hematoxyphilic nucleated spindle cells arranged parallel in a palisading manner around Verocay bodies, suggestive of Antoni A tissue, and edematous connective tissue stroma, dilated capillaries, and streams of loosely packed spindle cells in the interstitium, suggestive of Antoni B type tissue.
