What evidence of metastatic breast cancer was found during the physical examination and subsequent biopsy of the patient presented in the discharge summary?,"During the physical examination, there was no palpable mass in the region of the right shoulder, no skin discoloration or changes, and the range of motion and strength were normal. However, an open biopsy was performed on the coracoid identifying biopsy specimens from the lesion at the base of the coracoid, which confirmed the presence of adenocarcinoma. Therefore, evidence of metastatic breast adenocarcinoma was found during the biopsy.",1,"The evidence of metastatic breast cancer found during the physical examination and subsequent biopsy included a morphologically abnormal lymph node in the right axilla, which was confirmed to have metastasis to the right axillary lymph node.

The patient was discharged in stable condition with recommendations to continue medications, avoid activities that could injure the tongue, and seek medical attention if necessary. The prognosis is expected to be unremarkable."

Intra-abdominal dissemination was observed, and positive intraoperative peritoneal cytology was noted. The affected tissue was resected as much as possible, and six courses of chemotherapy were given. However, the remaining tumor still grew and eventually caused bilateral ureter obstruction and bilateral hydronephrosis, requiring a double-J catheter for relief.",1,"The relations that can be extracted regarding the patient's mucinous adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix and the treatments provided include:

1. **Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with retrorectal cyst's malignant transformation into mucinous adenocarcinoma.

"How can the diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia due to ESRD and sertraline therapy, as well as the patient's treatment with cabergoline to resolve galactorrhea, be paraphrased in simpler terms for the patient and their family to understand?","The patient had a hormone called prolactin at a high level, which caused milk discharge (galactorrhea) from her breasts. The high prolactin level was due to a combination of kidney disease (ESRD) and taking a medication called sertraline for depression. Cabergoline was used to treat the high prolactin level and resolved the galactorrhea. The patient will continue with dialysis modality and follow up with their primary care physician.",1,"The patient has high levels of prolactin, a hormone, which is causing symptoms like unwanted milk production (galactorrhea). This condition is linked to her kidney disease (end-stage renal disease, or ESRD) and the antidepressant medication sertraline she is taking. To help with this, she was given a medication called cabergoline, which successfully lowered her prolactin levels and stopped the milk production."
