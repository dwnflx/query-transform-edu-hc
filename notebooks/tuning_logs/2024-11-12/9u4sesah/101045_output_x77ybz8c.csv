"Posterior segment intraocular inflammation (PSII) is a putative Th1 CD4+ cell mediated autoimmune disorder. In experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis, neutralization of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha induces suppression of Th1 cells, macrophage activation, and target organ damage. Previous studies implicated an efficacy of anti-TNFalpha therapies in patients with PSII. This study investigated the immunomodulatory effect of anti-TNFalpha therapy to find predictors of effective immunosuppression in PSII. Fifteen patients with PSII refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapy received a single infusion of a recombinant protein generated by fusing the p55 TNFalpha receptor with human IgG1. During 17 treatment periods, visual acuity (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]) was monitored as a response criterion. Phenotype markers of CD4+ T cells were analyzed before and 2, 4, and 12 weeks after therapy. Expression of intracellular cytokines (interferon [IFN]-gamma, interleukin [IL]-10, and TNFalpha) and Th1/Th2-specific chemokine receptors (CXCR3, CCR4, and CCR5) on peripheral blood CD4+ T cells was determined using flow cytometry. The fraction of IL-10-expressing CD4+ T cells was increased during 12 of 17 treatment periods within 2 weeks after treatment. During eight treatment periods, this increase was associated with an improvement of visual acuity of at least 0.2 logMAR within 4 weeks (P = 0.029). The ratio between IL-10- and IFNgamma-expressing CD4+ T cells was significantly increased 2 weeks after therapy (P = 0.015). There was no significant change of CXCR3, CCR4, or CCR5 expression.",Does anti-TNFalpha therapy modulate the phenotype of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells in patients with posterior segment intraocular inflammation?,"Neutralizing TNFalpha activity in PSII increases the fraction of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells expressing IL-10, which correlates with a recovery of visual function.",0,"Yes, anti-TNFalpha therapy modulates the phenotype of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells in patients with posterior segment intraocular inflammation, as evidenced by an increase in the fraction of IL-10-expressing CD4+ T cells and a significant increase in the ratio of IL-10- to IFN-gamma-expressing CD4+ T cells after therapy.",0.7294914722442627
"In mast cell (MC) neoplasms, clinical problems requiring therapy include local aggressive and sometimes devastating growth of MCs and mediator-related symptoms. A key mediator of MCs responsible for clinical symptoms is histamine. Therefore, use of histamine receptor (HR) antagonists is an established approach to block histamine effects in these patients. We screened for additional beneficial effects of HR antagonists and asked whether any of these agents would also exert growth-inhibitory effects on primary neoplastic MCs, the human MC line HMC-1, and on two canine MC lines, C2 and NI-1. We found that the HR1 antagonists terfenadine and loratadine suppress spontaneous growth of HMC-1, C2, and NI-1 cells, as well as growth of primary neoplastic MCs in all donors tested (human patients, n = 5; canine patients, n = 8). The effects of both drugs were found to be dose-dependent (IC(50): terfenadine, 1-20 μM; loratadine, 10-50 μM). Both agents also produced apoptosis in neoplastic MCs and augmented apoptosis-inducing effects of two KIT-targeting drugs, PKC412 and dasatinib. The other HR1 antagonists (fexofenadine, diphenhydramine) and HR2 antagonists (famotidine, cimetidine, ranitidine) tested did not exert substantial growth-inhibitory effects on neoplastic MCs. None of the histamine receptor blockers were found to modulate cell-cycle progression in neoplastic MCs.",Do h1-receptor antagonists terfenadine and loratadine inhibit spontaneous growth of neoplastic mast cells?,"The HR1 antagonists terfenadine and loratadine, in addition to their antimediator activity, exert in vitro growth-inhibitory effects on neoplastic MCs. Whether these drugs (terfenadine) alone, or in combination with KIT inhibitors, can also affect in vivo neoplastic MC growth remains to be determined.",0,"Yes, H1-receptor antagonists terfenadine and loratadine inhibit spontaneous growth of neoplastic mast cells.",0.7411747574806213
"The genetic architecture of obesity is multifactorial. We have previously identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on rat chromosome 10 in a F2 cross of Wistar Ottawa Karlsburg (WOKW) and Dark Agouti (DA) rats responsible for obesity-related traits. The QTL was confirmed in congenic DA.WOKW10 rats. To pinpoint the region carrying causal genes, we established two new subcongenic lines, L1 and L2, with smaller refined segments of chromosome 10 to identify novel candidate genes. All lines were extensively characterized under different diet conditions. We employed transcriptome analysis in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) by RNA-Seq technology to identify potential underlying genes in the segregating regions. Three candidate genes were measured in human paired samples of VAT and subcutaneous (SC) AT (SAT) (N=304) individuals with a wide range of body weight and glucose homeostasis parameters. DA.WOKW and L1 subcongenic lines were protected against body fat gain under high-fat diet (HFD), whereas L2 and DA had significantly more body fat after high-fat feeding. Interestingly, adipocyte size distribution in SAT and epigonadal AT of L1 subcongenic rats did not undergo typical ballooning under HFD and the number of preadipocytes in AT was significantly elevated in L2 compared with L1 and parental rats. Transcriptome analysis identified three candidate genes in VAT on rat chromosome 10. In humans, these candidate genes were differentially expressed between SAT and VAT. Moreover, HID1 mRNA significantly correlates with parameters of obesity and glucose metabolism.","Are novel genes on rat chromosome 10 linked to body fat mass , preadipocyte number and adipocyte size?","Our data suggest novel candidate genes for obesity that map on rat chromosome 10 in an interval 102.2-104.7 Mb and are strongly associated with body fat mass regulation, preadipocyte number and adipocyte size in rats.

"The adult heart possesses a pool of progenitor cells stored in myocardial niches, but the mechanisms involved in the activation of this cell compartment are currently unknown. Ca2+ promotes cell growth raising the possibility that changes in intracellular Ca2+ initiate division of c-kit-positive human cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs) and determine their fate. Ca2+ oscillations were identified in hCPCs and these events occurred independently from coupling with cardiomyocytes or the presence of extracellular Ca2+. These findings were confirmed in the heart of transgenic mice in which enhanced green fluorescent protein was under the control of the c-kit promoter. Ca2+ oscillations in hCPCs were regulated by the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum through activation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and the reuptake of Ca2+ by the sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (SERCA). IP3Rs and SERCA were highly expressed in hCPCs, whereas ryanodine receptors were not detected. Although Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, store-operated Ca2+ channels and plasma membrane Ca2+ pump were present and functional in hCPCs, they had no direct effects on Ca2+ oscillations. Conversely, Ca2+ oscillations and their frequency markedly increased with ATP and histamine which activated purinoceptors and histamine-1 receptors highly expressed in hCPCs. Importantly, Ca2+ oscillations in hCPCs were coupled with the entry of cells into the cell cycle and 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Induction of Ca2+ oscillations in hCPCs before their intramyocardial delivery to infarcted hearts was associated with enhanced engraftment and expansion of these cells promoting the generation of a large myocyte progeny.",Do spontaneous calcium oscillations regulate human cardiac progenitor cell growth?,IP3R-mediated Ca2+ mobilization control hCPC growth and their regenerative potential.,0,"Yes, spontaneous calcium oscillations regulate human cardiac progenitor cell growth by promoting cell cycle entry and division.",0.6945708394050598
"mTOR inhibitors are currently used as immunosuppressants in transplanted patients and as promising anti-cancer agents. However, new-onset diabetes is a frequent complication occurring in patients treated with mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin (Sirolimus). Here, we investigated the mechanisms associated with the diabetogenic effects of chronic Sirolimus administration in rats and in in vitro cell cultures. Sirolimus was administered to rats fed either a standard or high-fat diet for 21 days. Metabolic parameters were measured in vivo and in ex vivo tissues. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by glucose tolerance tests and euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamps. Rapamycin effects on glucose metabolism and insulin signalling were further evaluated in cultured myotubes. Sirolimus induced a decrease in food intake and concomitant weight loss. It also induced specific fat mass loss that was independent of changes in food intake. Despite these beneficial effects, Sirolimus-treated rats were glucose intolerant, hyperinsulinaemic and hyperglycaemic, but not hyperlipidaemic. The euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp measurements showed skeletal muscle is a major site of Sirolimus-induced insulin resistance. At the molecular level, long-term Sirolimus administration attenuated glucose uptake and metabolism in skeletal muscle by preventing full insulin-induced Akt activation and altering the expression and translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane. In rats fed a high-fat diet, these metabolic defects were exacerbated, although Sirolimus-treated animals were protected from diet-induced obesity.",Does chronic mTOR inhibition by rapamycin induce muscle insulin resistance despite weight loss in rats?,"Taken together, our data demonstrate that the diabetogenic effect of chronic rapamycin administration is due to an impaired insulin action on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscles.",0,"Yes, chronic mTOR inhibition by rapamycin induces muscle insulin resistance despite weight loss in rats.",0.6939436793327332
"Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are a major constituent of the hyperplastic synovial pannus that aggressively invades cartilage and bone during the course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Fractalkine (FKN/CX(3)CL1) expression is up-regulated in RA synovium and RA synovial fluid. While RA FLS express the FKN receptor, CX(3)CR1, the pathophysiologic relevance of FKN stimulation of RA FLS is not understood. This study was undertaken to better characterize the relationship between FKN and the RA FLS that both produce it and express its receptor. RA FLS were subjected to chemotaxis and proliferation assays, Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and filamentous actin staining to characterize the relationship between FKN and RA FLS. FKN secretion by RA FLS was regulated mainly by tumor necrosis factor alpha. Stimulation of RA FLS with FKN led to significant cytoskeletal rearrangement but no proliferation. Chemotaxis assays revealed that FKN was a novel chemoattractant for RA FLS. Stimulation of RA FLS with FKN resulted in activation of MAP kinases and Akt. JNK, ERK-1/2, and Akt (at both Ser-473 and Thr-308) were each up-regulated in a time-dependent manner. Inhibition of ERK-1/2-mediated signaling, but not JNK or Akt, significantly repressed FKN-induced RA FLS migration.",Is fractalkine a novel chemoattractant for rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocyte signaling through MAP kinases and Akt?,"These findings indicate a novel role of FKN in regulating RA FLS cytoskeletal structure and migration. FKN specifically induces RA FLS phosphorylation of the MAP kinases JNK and ERK-1/2, as well as full activation of Akt.",0,"Yes, fractalkine is a novel chemoattractant for rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes, signaling through MAP kinases and Akt.",0.5838790535926819
"Sleep disturbance is common during critical illness, yet little is known about its prevalence or role in post-discharge quality of life among high-risk acute lung injury (ALI) patients. In a prospective cohort of 61 mechanically ventilated ALI patients, we examined the association between insomnia symptoms and quality of life six months after discharge. Subjects completed surveys rating quality of life (MOS SF-36), post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL), and depression (PHQ-9). Using an individual item from the PCL, we defined insomnia symptoms as moderate or greater trouble falling or staying asleep in the past month. We performed multivariable linear regression to examine the association between insomnia symptoms and SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores, adjusting for PTSD and depression. Forty subjects (85% of eligible) completed six-month questionnaires; 20 (50%) met criteria for insomnia symptoms. After adjustment for PTSD and depression, insomnia symptoms remained significantly associated with worse physical component summary scores (adjusted mean difference=-8.8; 95% CI: -15.0, -2.5; P<0.01).",Are post-discharge insomnia symptoms associated with quality of life impairment among survivors of acute lung injury?,"Post-discharge insomnia symptoms were common and significantly associated with physical quality of life impairment among six-month ALI survivors, even after adjustment for PTSD and depression symptoms. Further studies are needed to validate these results and to characterize sleep disturbance after ALI using sleep-specific metrics.",0,"Yes, post-discharge insomnia symptoms are associated with quality of life impairment among survivors of acute lung injury, as insomnia symptoms were significantly linked to worse physical component summary scores in a study of mechanically ventilated ALI patients.",0.7225099205970764
"Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) improves skin flap function and inhibits partial necrosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Our study aimed to evaluate the mechanism underlying HBO regulation of the antiapoptosis factors associated with I/R injury of skin flaps. The rats were divided into sham surgery, I/R, and HBO groups. Rats from the HBO group received HBO preconditioning followed by I/R surgery. Blood perfusion of the skin flaps was measured with laser Doppler flowmeters. Tissue morphology and apoptosis were subsequently assessed based on hematoxylin-eosinhe and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining. Protein expression of phosphorylated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (pASK-1), phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax) was examined by immunodetection, and Bcl-2 messenger RNA expression was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, caspase-3 activity was also measured. The result of microcirculation analysis showed that the survival and blood perfusion rates significantly increased in the skin flap after HBO exposure. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining revealed that cell apoptosis was significantly attenuated in the HBO group. Furthermore, HBO preconditioning increased the expression of Bcl-2 and inhibited pASK-1, pJNK, and Bax expression as determined by both immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Caspase-3 activity and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio declined in the HBO group.",Does hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning inhibit skin flap apoptosis in a rat ischemia-reperfusion model?,HBO preconditioning effectively ameliorates I/R injury by regulating the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 and/or c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway and anti- and proapoptosis factors.,0,"Yes, hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning inhibits skin flap apoptosis in a rat ischemia-reperfusion model.",0.6225820779800415
"Endotoxemia stimulates amino acid consumption by the liver, but the regulation of this response is poorly understood. We studied the effect of Escherichia coli endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) on hepatic carrier-mediated plasma membrane amino acid transport and the role of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in regulating this transport activity. We investigated the activities of the Na(+)-dependent amino acid transport systems A, ASC, and N in hepatic plasma membrane vesicles prepared from rats treated with endotoxin in vivo. Vesicle purity and functionality were evaluated by assaying marker enzymes and by the presence of classic overshoots. Endotoxin treatment did not alter sodium transport but resulted in time- and dose-dependent 6-fold (system A), 3.5-fold (system N), and 3-fold (system ASC) increases in transport activity secondary to an increase in carrier maximum velocity. Lipopolysaccharide treatment did not alter transporter affinity or plasma membrane sodium transport. Transport activity increased within 2 hours of endotoxin administration, peaked at 4 hours after exposure to lipopolysaccharide, and returned to basal levels within 24 hours. Pretreatment of animals with an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody diminished the endotoxin-induced enhancement in transport activity by 50% to 75% by decreasing carrier maximum velocity. In contrast, when the antibody was given after endotoxin challenge, transport activity was not attenuated.",Does antibody to tumor necrosis factor attenuate endotoxin-stimulated amino acid transport in rat liver?,"The marked acceleration in hepatic amino acid uptake that occurs during endotoxemia is secondary to an increased Na(+)-dependent hepatocyte plasma membrane transport activity and is mediated, in large part, by the cytokine TNF.",0,"Yes, pretreatment with an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody diminished the endotoxin-induced enhancement in amino acid transport activity by 50% to 75%.",0.6505115628242493
"Intense resistance exercise causes mechanical loading of skeletal muscle, followed by muscle adaptation. Chemotactic factors likely play an important role in these processes. We investigated the time course of changes in the expression and tissue localization of several key chemotactic factors in skeletal muscle during the early phase of recovery following resistance exercise. Muscle biopsy samples were obtained from vastus lateralis of eight untrained men (22 ± 0.5 years) before and 2, 4 and 24 h after three sets of leg press, squat and leg extension at 80 % 1-RM. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (95×), interleukin-8 (2,300×), IL-6 (317×), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (15×), vascular endothelial growth factor (2×) and fractalkine (2.5×) mRNA was significantly elevated 2 h post-exercise. Interleukin-8 (38×) and interleukin-6 (58×) protein was also significantly elevated 2 h post-exercise, while monocyte chemotactic protein-1 protein was significantly elevated at 2 h (22×) and 4 h (21×) post-exercise. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and interleukin-8 were expressed by cells residing in the interstitial space between muscle fibers and, in some cases, were co-localized with CD68 + macrophages, PAX7 + satellite cells and blood vessels. However, the patterns of staining were inconclusive and not consistent.",Does acute resistance exercise increase the expression of chemotactic factors within skeletal muscle?,"In conclusion, resistance exercise stimulated a marked increase in the mRNA and protein expression of various chemotactic factors in skeletal muscle. Myofibers were not the dominant source of these factors.

"To investigate the effect of rhubarb on MAPK activation in sodium taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in rats. All rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, acute pancreatitis (AP) and rhubarb treatment groups. The MAPK activation was detected by western blotting. The levels of TNFα and IL6 in serum were estimated by ELISA. The pathological changes of the pancreas were examined microscopically. It was found that hemorrhage, exudates and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the pancreas were significantly less in the rhubarb group than in the AP group. In the AP group, the activation of MAPKs in pancreatic tissues was enhanced significantly at every time point compared with the control group and the levels of TNFα and IL6 were also increased. Rhubarb treatment markedly inhibited activation of MAPKs concomitantly with inhibition of TNFα and IL6 expression.",Does rhubarb attenuate the severity of acute necrotizing pancreatitis by inhibiting MAPKs in rats?,We suggest that rhubarb probably attenuates AP by inhibiting activation of MAPKs and expression of inflammatory mediators.,0,"Yes, rhubarb attenuates the severity of acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats by inhibiting MAPK activation.",0.7773527503013611
"Enteric neurons have been reported to be increased in inflamed regions of the bowel in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or intestinal neurogangliomatosis. It is impossible to determine whether this hyperinnervation predates intestinal inflammation, results from it, or contributes to its severity in humans, so we studied this process in mice. To determine whether the density of enteric neurons determines the severity of inflammation, we studied transgenic mice that have greater than normal (NSE-noggin mice, which overexpress noggin under the control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter) or fewer than normal (Hand2(+/-) mice) numbers of neurons in the enteric nervous system. Colitis was induced with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid or dextran sulfate sodium, and the intensity of the resulting inflammation in Hand2(+/-) and NSE-noggin mice was compared with that of wild-type littermates. Severity of each form of colitis (based on survival, symptom, and histologic scores; intestinal expression of genes that encode proinflammatory molecules; and levels of neutrophil elastase and p50 nuclear factor κB) were significantly reduced in Hand2(+/-) mice and significantly increased in NSE-noggin animals. Neither mouse differed from wild-type in the severity of delayed-type hypersensitivity (edema, T-cell and neutrophil infiltration, or expression of interleukin-1β, interferon-γ, or tumor necrosis factor-α) induced in the ears using 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene. Transgene effects on inflammation were therefore restricted to the gastrointestinal tract.",Does enteric neuronal density contribute to the severity of intestinal inflammation?,The severity of intestinal inflammation is associated with the density of the enteric innervation in mice. Abnormalities in development of the enteric nervous system might therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.,0,"Yes, enteric neuronal density does contribute to the severity of intestinal inflammation, as evidenced by the findings in the study where transgenic mice with increased neuronal density (NSE-noggin mice) exhibited significantly increased inflammation, while those with decreased neuronal density (Hand2(+/-) mice) showed significantly reduced inflammation.",0.6673852801322937
"Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trans-trihydroxystilbene), a natural phytoalexin, has various pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of oxidation, leukocyte priming, and expression of inflammatory mediators. The present study was aimed to investigate the possible beneficial activities of resveratrol on lung and kidney damage in a rat model of sepsis. Sepsis was induced to Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes (200-250 g) by cecal ligation and perforation. The rats were treated with resveratrol (30 mg/kg; i.p.) or saline after induction of sepsis and at 16 h. Twenty-four hours after the sepsis-induction, all rats were decapitated. Blood was collected for the measurement of tumor necrosis factor-alpha level and lactate dehydrogenase activity. Lung and kidney samples were taken for histological assessment and for the measurement of malondialdehyde, glutathione level, myeloperoxidase activity, and collagen content. Sepsis caused a significant increase in malondialdehyde levels, myeloperoxidase activity, and collagen content of the lung and kidney tissues with a concomitant reduction in glutathione levels. Microscopic examination revealed severe destruction of regular morphology in both lung and kidney tissues. Serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha and lactate dehydrogenase levels also were higher in rats with sepsis compared to those of the sham group. Resveratrol treatment reversed these biochemical parameters and preserved tissue morphology as evidenced by histological evaluation.",Does resveratrol reduce renal and lung injury caused by sepsis in rats?,"Resveratrol, a phenolic compound, reduces sepsis-induced remote organ injury, at least in part, through its ability to balance oxidant-antioxidant status, to inhibit neutrophil infiltration and to regulate the release of inflammatory mediators.",0,"Yes, resveratrol reduces renal and lung injury caused by sepsis in rats, as evidenced by its ability to reverse biochemical parameters and preserve tissue morphology.",0.719214916229248

"Systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction have been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Since insulin resistance can promote endothelial dysfunction and anti-TNF-alpha blockade yield a rapid improvement of endothelial function, we have sought to assess whether TNF-alpha blockade may also result in a reduction of insulin serum levels and improvement of insulin resistance in RA patients who require this therapy because of severe and refractory disease. We recruited patients with RA seen over a period of 1 month at Hospital Xeral-Calde, Lugo, Spain, that were on treatment with anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody-infliximab. Patients with diabetes mellitus or plasma glucose > 110 mg/dl were excluded. Fasting blood samples were taken for determination of plasma glucose and serum insulin levels immediately prior to and after infliximab infusion. Twenty-seven RA patients (21 women; mean age: 57.1 years; mean DAS28: 4.43) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Dramatic reduction in the serum insulin levels and insulin/glucose index was observed following infliximab infusion.

"Borrelia burgdorferi has limited biosynthetic capabilities and must scavenge N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), an essential component of the microbial cell wall, from the surrounding environment. Spirochetes cultured in the absence of free GlcNAc exhibit biphasic growth; however, addition of chitobiose (a dimer of GlcNAc) substitutes for free GlcNAc resulting in a single exponential phase. We evaluated the effect of RpoS and RpoN, the only alternative sigma factors in B. burgdorferi, on biphasic growth and chitobiose utilization in the absence of free GlcNAc. In addition, we investigated the source of GlcNAc in the second exponential phase. By comparing the growth of wild-type cells to insertional mutants for rpoS and rpoN we determined that RpoS, but not RpoN, partially regulates both biphasic growth and chitobiose utilization. The rpoS mutant, cultured in the absence of free GlcNAc, exhibited a significant delay in the ability to initiate a second exponential phase compared to the wild type and rpoS complemented mutant. Expression analysis of chbC, which encodes the membrane-spanning protein of the chitobiose phosphotransferase system, suggests the delay is due to the inability of the rpoS mutant to up regulate chbC. Furthermore, supplementing GlcNAc starved cultures with high concentrations (75 or 150 microM) of chitobiose resulted in biphasic growth of the rpoS mutant compared to a single exponential phase for the wild type and rpoS complemented mutant. In contrast, growth of the rpoN mutant under all conditions was similar to the wild type. 5' Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RACE) revealed the transcriptional start site for chbC to be 42 bp upstream of the translational start site. Analysis of the chbC promoter region revealed homology to previously described RpoD and RpoS B. burgdorferi promoters.

"Reduction in the number of circulating blood lymphocytes (lymphocytopaenia) has been reported during clinical episodes of malaria and is normalized after treatment with anti-malaria drugs. While this phenomenon is well established in malaria infection, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. In the present study, the occurrence of apoptosis and its pathways in CD4+ T cells was investigated in naturally Plasmodium vivax-infected individuals from a Brazilian endemic area (Porto Velho - RO). Blood samples were collected from P. vivax-infected individuals and healthy donors. The apoptosis was characterized by cell staining with Annexin V/FITC and propidium iodide and the apoptosis-associated gene expression profile was carried out using RT2 Profiler PCR Array-Human Apoptosis. The plasma TNF level was determined by ELISA. The unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test was applied according to the data distribution. Plasmodium vivax-infected individuals present low number of leukocytes and lymphocytes with a higher percentage of CD4+ T cells in early and/or late apoptosis.

The T lymphocytes apoptosis could reflect a strategy of immune evasion triggered by the parasite, enabling their persistence but also limiting the occurrence of immunopathology.",0,"Yes, CD4+ T cell apoptosis in Plasmodium vivax infection is mediated by the activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, as indicated by increased gene expression of TNFRSF1B and Bid (extrinsic pathway) and a reduction of Bcl-2 (intrinsic pathway).",0.7351788878440857
"An increased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been noted in infants who are born to mothers with chorioamnionitis. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that newborn rat pups born to mothers exposed to prenatal lipopolysaccharide during pregnancy would be more susceptible to intestinal injury in a rat model of NEC and that the increased intestinal injury is mediated by dysregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Time-dated pregnant Sprague-Dawley dams were given an intraperitoneal injection of either 2 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide or vehicle. Rat pups from each group of dams were delivered at term and placed in a rat NEC model. A subset of pups was given either vehicle or aminoguanidine. Intestines were harvested and graded for degree of intestinal injury. Maternal prenatal lipopolysaccharide exposure increased the frequency and severity of intestinal injury in the neonatal rat NEC model. Treatment with aminoguanidine significantly decreased plasma nitric oxide levels. Additionally, aminoguanidine significantly decreased intestinal injury.",Does prenatal lipopolysaccharide increase postnatal intestinal injury in a rat model of necrotizing enterocolitis?,Intestinal injury observed may be mediated via nitric oxide synthase dysregulation.,0,"Yes, prenatal lipopolysaccharide exposure increases postnatal intestinal injury in a rat model of necrotizing enterocolitis.",0.6324055194854736
"The mechanisms and treatment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) remain elusive. We have used partially inbred miniature swine to determine the role of class I MHC antigens in the pathogenesis of CAV and to determine whether acquired tolerance to donor antigen can prevent the development of CAV in large animals. Previous studies demonstrated that miniature swine treated with 12 days of cyclosporine (CsA) after the transplantation of MHC class I-disparate kidney allografts all became tolerant to the donor kidneys and survived indefinitely. In the present study, heart allografts were transplanted across the same MHC class I disparity in CsA-treated swine. Unlike kidney allografts, heart allografts were rejected in 33-55 days. By postoperative day 28, all cardiac allografts had developed the intimal proliferation characteristic of CAV. When hearts and kidneys from the same donors were transplanted simultaneously into class I-disparate, CsA-treated recipients, the hosts became tolerant to their cardiac allografts and survived long-term. Furthermore, none of the hearts from the combined heart/kidney recipients developed evidence of CAV. Thus, this report demonstrates that: (1) MHC class I antigens play an important role in the pathogenesis of CAV, (2) the specific unresponsiveness to donor class I antigen induced by a class I-disparate kidney protects a heart transplanted from the same organ donor, and (3) the induction of acquired tolerance prevents the development of CAV.",Does transplantation tolerance prevent cardiac allograft vasculopathy in major histocompatibility complex class I-disparate miniature swine?,These findings in a preclinical system establish the significance of antigen-dependent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CAV and underscore the importance of achieving tolerance in clinical transplantation.,0,"Yes, transplantation tolerance prevents cardiac allograft vasculopathy in major histocompatibility complex class I-disparate miniature swine.",0.5952935218811035
"To validate the efficacy of an innovative multimodality therapy with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) plus octreotide and celecoxib in reducing neoangiogenesis and prolonging the survival of rabbits with hepatocellular carcinoma. Rabbits with hepatic VX2 allografts were divided into four groups: control group, TAE group, octreotide + celecoxib (O + C) group and the multimodality therapy (TAE + O + C) group. Survival of the rabbits was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the expression of CD31 in tumor tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. Rabbits in the TAE + O + C group lived nearly 20 days longer than those in the control group. The survival rate of the TAE + O + C group was 50% at day 80 and was the highest among the four groups (P < 0.05). No VX2 allograft-bearing rabbits in the control group lived longer than 60 days.

"The MYC oncogene is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and has been associated with widespread microRNA (miRNA) repression; however, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we report that the c-Myc oncogenic transcription factor physically interacts with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a core enzymatic unit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Furthermore, miR-101, an important tumor-suppressive miRNA in human hepatocarcinomas, is epigenetically repressed by PRC2 complex in a c-Myc-mediated manner. miR-101, in turn, inhibits the expression of two subunits of PRC2 (EZH2 and EED), thus creating a double-negative feedback loop that regulates the process of hepatocarcinogenesis. Restoration of miR-101 expression suppresses multiple malignant phenotypes of HCC cells by coordinate repression of a cohort of oncogenes, including STMN1, JUNB, and CXCR7, and further increases expression of endogenous miR-101 by inhibition of PRC2 activation. In addition, co-overexpression of c-Myc and EZH2 in HCC samples was closely associated with lower expression of miR-101 (P < 0.0001) and poorer prognosis of HCC patients (P < 0.01).",Does c-Myc-mediated epigenetic silencing of MicroRNA-101 contribute to dysregulation of multiple pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma?,c-Myc collaborates with EZH2-containing PRC2 complex in silencing tumor-suppressive miRNAs during hepatocarcinogenesis and provides promising therapeutic candidates for human HCC.,0,"Yes, c-Myc-mediated epigenetic silencing of MicroRNA-101 contributes to the dysregulation of multiple pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).",0.6664482951164246
"The issue to be resolved was whether peripheral leg blood flow in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) is reduced by low local flow capacity or as a function of the amount of muscle mass activated during exercise. In ten CHF patients (ejection fraction 26 (9)%), and 12 healthy controls central and peripheral circulatory responses were assessed during dynamic one- and two-legged knee extensor work. The patients reached a peak perfusion of 234 (16) ml 100 g-1 min-1 in the one-legged mode, which was similar to the controls (244 (11) ml 100 g-1 min-1). At peak two-legged work muscle perfusion was reduced in the patients by 24% (P < 0.05). In contrast the controls maintained their peak muscle perfusion. The mass of the quadriceps femoris muscle and peak leg blood flow correlated closely for both groups at peak one-legged work (r = 0.85, P < 0.001). Peak oxygen uptake in the active limb during one-legged exercise was similar for patients and controls (0.52 (0.06) vs. 0.63 (0.06) l min-1), but it was 38% lower (P < 0.05) in patients than controls during exhaustive two-legged exercise. Arterial systemic oxygen delivery (cardiac output x arterial oxygen content), at peak exercise was highly correlated with peak one- and two-legged workload for both groups, explaining 70% of the difference in peak workload attained (P < 0.001). At peak two-legged exercise non-exercising tissues of the body in the male CHF patients with the largest limb muscle mass, received a blood flow of only 1.2 (0.7) 1 min-1. Mean arterial blood pressure at peak work in both test conditions was significantly lower for the patients than the controls. A higher sympathetic nerve activity in the patients, as evaluated by arterial noradrenaline concentration (NA) and leg NA spillover, contributed to maintain the perfusion pressure.",Is peak skeletal muscle perfusion maintained in patients with chronic heart failure when only a small muscle mass is exercised?,"Patients with moderate CHF can reach a peak skeletal muscle perfusion and a leg oxygen uptake comparable to that of healthy individuals when a sufficiently small muscle mass is activated.

"Kupffer cells have been proposed to be a major cellular origin of pro-inflammatory mediators in sepsis. However, the cytokine response of Kupffer cells to gram-positive bacteria and their endotoxins peptidoglycan (PepG) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) has never previously been studied. Primary cultures of rat and human Kupffer cells were exposed to live Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (4.0 x 10(1) to 4.0 x 10(7) CFU/mL culture medium), as well as highly purified PepG and LTA (0-100 microg/mL). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 1 microg/mL was used for control. In parallel experiments, whole blood obtained from the same rats was stimulated in a similar manner. Accumulation of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in plasma or culture supernatants were assessed by enzyme immuno assays. TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. PepG and LTA, as well as live S. aureus, induced the production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in Kupffer cells from both species in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Whereas PepG was a more potent inducer of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in whole blood, the opposite seemed to be the case in Kupffer cells. In fact, a 100-fold lower concentration of LTA (1 microg/mL) than of PepG (100 microg/mL) was sufficient to induce a substantial production of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the Kupffer cells. TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA were induced correspondingly.",Is lipoteichoic acid a potent inducer of cytokine production in rat and human Kupffer cells in vitro?,Our results support the contention that gram-positive bacteria may activate cytokine production in Kupffer cells during bacteremia and suggest that LTA is important in this interaction.,0,"Yes, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is a potent inducer of cytokine production in rat and human Kupffer cells in vitro, as it induced substantial production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 at a concentration of 1 microg/mL, which is significantly lower than the concentration required for peptidoglycan.",0.6517912745475769
"It is known that chronic wounds such as leg ulcers have an increased risk of malignant transformation, mainly to squamous cell carcinoma (reviewed in Reference 1). To better understand the molecular changes responsible for this increased risk of malignant transformation, we examined the expression of c-fos and c-Ha-ras, proto-oncogenes known to be involved in cellular proliferation and transformation, in chronic wounds. The level of both c-fos and c-Ha-ras mRNAs, determined by in situ hybridization, were heavily induced in the basal layer of epidermis in chronic wounds when compared to normal skin and acute wounds, (originated from the edge of wounds created by Moh's surgery).

"There are two opposing possibilities for the main pathogenesis of trauma-induced coagulopathy: an acute coagulopathy of trauma shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation with the fibrinolytic phenotype. The objective of this study was to clarify the main pathogenesis of trauma-induced coagulopathy using a rat model of Noble-Collip drum trauma. Eighteen rats were divided into the control, trauma 0, and trauma 30 groups. The trauma 0 and 30 groups were exposed to Noble-Collip drum trauma. Blood samples were drawn without, immediately after, and 30 min after Noble-Collip drum trauma in the control, trauma 0, and trauma 30 groups, respectively. Coagulation and fibrinolysis markers were measured. Thrombin generation was assessed according to a calibrated automated thrombogram. Spontaneous thrombin bursts resulting from circulating procoagulants were observed in the nonstimulated thrombin generation assay immediately after trauma. Soluble fibrin levels (a marker of thrombin generation in the systemic circulation) were 50-fold greater in the trauma groups than in the control group. The resultant coagulation activation consumed platelets, coagulation factors, and antithrombin. Endogenous thrombin potential and factor II ratio were significantly negatively correlated with antithrombin levels, suggesting insufficient control of thrombin generation by antithrombin. High levels of active tissue-type plasminogen activator induced hyperfibrin(ogen)olysis. Soluble thrombomodulin increased significantly.

"This study aimed to evaluate the role of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1) G1958A variant (rs2236225) as a 'maternal, paternal, or embryonic' genetic risk factor for neural tube defect (NTD) susceptibility. It also estimated differential associations based on type of NTD, offspring sex, maternal-paternal-offspring genotype incompatibility, and parent-of-origin effects (POE) using both case-control and family-based approach. In addition, genotype impact on serum folate levels was also assessed. The study population (n=900) consisted of 120 NTD case-parent triads (n=120×3=360) and 180 healthy control-parent triads (n=180×3=540) from South India. Umbilical cord tissues were collected from those with NTD and control newborn infants, and blood samples from case and control parents. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Statistical analysis used were SPSS, transmission disequilibrium test and POE. Serum folate levels were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the case-control study, those with the MTHFD1 G1958A variant were associated with around twofold risk of anencephaly (p=0.01) and spina bifida (p<0.01). Among parents, fathers were associated with around twofold risk of having an offspring with anencephaly (p<0.01). Considering offspring sex, the A allele in single or double dose conferred around two- to fourfold risk of anencephaly (p=0.01), spina bifida (p<0.01), and encephalocele (p<0.05) in females only. Maternal AA genotype was not associated independently but conferred threefold risk when combined with paternal GA genotype (p=0.01).

"Actin-myosin II motor converts chemical energy into force/motion in muscle and nonmuscle cells. The phosphorylation of 20-kilodalton regulatory myosin light chain (MLC(20)) is critical to the cytoplasmic functions of these motors. We do not know whether myosin II and actins in the nucleus function as motors to generate relative motion, such as that between RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and DNA, for assembly of the preinitiation complex. The experiments were performed on primary cultures of human colonic circular smooth muscle cells and rat colonic circular muscle strips. We show that myosin II and alpha- and beta-actins are present in the nuclei of colonic smooth muscle cells. The nuclear myosin II is tethered to recognition sequence AGCTCC (-39/-34) in the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) core promoter region. The actins are known to complex with RNA polymerase II, and they are tethered to the nucleoskeleton. The dephosphorylation of MLC(20) increases the transcription of ICAM-1, whereas its phosphorylation decreases it.

"We and others have demonstrated that additional positive lymph nodes (LNs) are identified in only 8% to 33% of patients with melanoma who have positive sentinel LNs (SLNs) and undergo complete therapeutic LN dissection (cTLND). We sought to determine predictors of additional regional LN involvement in patients with positive SLNs. Patients with clinically node-negative melanoma who underwent SLN biopsy (1991 to 2003) and had positive SLNs were identified. Clinicopathologic factors, including extent of microscopic disease within SLNs, were evaluated as potential predictors of positive non-SLNs. Overall, 359 (16.3%) of the 2,203 patients identified had a positive SLN. Positive non-SLNs were identified in 48 (14.0%) of the 343 patients with positive SLNs who underwent cTLND. On univariate analysis, several measures of SLN microscopic tumor burden, one versus three or more SLNs harvested, tumor thickness more than 2 mm, age older than 50 years, and Clark level higher than III were predictive of positive non-SLNs; primary tumor ulceration and number of positive SLNs had no apparent impact. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, measures of SLN microscopic tumor burden were the most significant independent predictors of positive non-SLNs; tumor thickness more than 2 mm and number of SLNs harvested also predicted additional disease.

"Tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) inhibitors such as adalimumab and infliximab are frequently prescribed for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite the clinical success of TNFα inhibitors, their physiological mode of action is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the mode of action of anti-TNFα agents in IBD. It was hypothesised that Notch mediates anti-TNFα action in T cells. A study was carried out to identify Notch-1 as a link by which anti-TNFα antibodies mediate their inhibitory functions. TNFα inhibitors induced T cell apoptosis, inhibited activation, reduced cytokine secretion and restricted cell cycling. TNFα blockade at several levels showed that TNFα is responsible for inducing apoptosis by anti-TNFα but not for cell cycle restriction. By linking Notch and TNFα it was shown that (1) Notch-1 mucosal expression differs in inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa and increases in response to anti-TNFα treatment; (2) Notch-1 function is regulated by TNFα inhibitors; (3) Notch-1 binds to TNFα; and (4) Notch-1 inhibition prevents anti-TNFα-induced T cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis.",Do tNFα inhibitors restrict T cell activation and cycling via Notch-1 signalling in inflammatory bowel disease?,"TNFα inhibitors potently inhibit T cell function.

"In frog skeletal muscle, two ryanodine receptor (RyR) isoforms, alpha-RyR and beta-RyR, are expressed in nearly equal amounts. However, the roles and significance of the two isoforms in excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling remains to be elucidated. In this study, we expressed either or both alpha-RyR and beta-RyR in 1B5 RyR-deficient myotubes using the herpes simplex virus 1 helper-free amplicon system.

In Ca(2+) imaging studies, each isoform exhibited caffeine-induced Ca(2+) transients, an indicative of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR). However, the fashion of Ca(2+) release events was fundamentally different: alpha-RyR mediated graded and sustained Ca(2+) release observed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, whereas beta-RyR supported all-or-none type regenerative Ca(2+) oscillations and waves. alpha-RyR but not beta-RyR exhibited Ca(2+) transients triggered by membrane depolarization with high [K(+)](o) that were nifedipine-sensitive, indicating that only alpha-RyR mediates depolarization-induced Ca(2+) release.

The immunohistochemical staining profile of PCNSL was determined from 66 immunocompetent patients. Then, the authors evaluated whether the expression of these proteins was associated with progression-free or overall survival. Only 8% of PCNSL samples were positive for the cluster designation (CD) germinal center marker CD10. Another germinal center marker, bcl-6, was positive in 47% of samples. Ninety-four percent of samples expressed significant levels of the postgerminal center marker melanoma-associated antigen (MUM-1).

"Reduced uninvolved immunoglobulin (Ig) levels are a hallmark of multiple myeloma. We previously showed that B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is solubilized and at high levels in multiple myeloma patient serum. We hypothesize that soluble BCMA binds B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) preventing its function to stimulate late B cells, and would result in lower polyclonal antibody levels in these patients. Mice were dosed with recombinant human BCMA (rhBCMA) and BCMA-BAFF complexes were analyzed in plasma, and its effects on antibody and Ig heavy chain mRNA levels determined. Using flow cytometry, BAFF binding to B cells was examined in the presence of rhBCMA and sera from multiple myeloma patients. In multiple myeloma sera, BCMA-BAFF complex formation and BCMA, IgA, IgG levels, and heavy-light chain isoform pair levels were determined. rhBCMA-BAFF complexes formed in immune-competent and deficient mice. Mice with human multiple myeloma xenografts, which contain plasma hBCMA and hBCMA-BAFF complexes, showed reduced plasma-free BAFF levels. rhBCMA administered to immune competent mice markedly reduced plasma IgA, IgG, and IgM levels and splenic Ig heavy chain mRNA levels. In serum from multiple myeloma patients, BCMA-BAFF complexes were detected and BAFF levels were reduced. Multiple myeloma patient sera containing BCMA prevented binding of BAFF to B cells.

"An ideal pharmaceutical treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is to prevent aneurysm formation and development (further dilatation of pre-existing aneurysm). Recent studies have reported that oxidative stress with reactive oxygen species (ROS) is crucial in aneurysm formation. We hypothesized that edaravone, a free-radical scavenger, would attenuate vascular oxidative stress and inhibit AAA formation and development. An AAA model induced with intraluminal elastase and extraluminal calcium chloride was created in 42 rats. Thirty-six rats were divided three groups: a low-dose (group LD; 1 mg/kg/d), high-dose (group HD; 5 mg/kg/d), and control (group C, saline). Edaravone or saline was intraperitoneally injected twice daily, starting 30 minutes before aneurysm preparation. The remaining six rats (group DA) received a delayed edaravone injection (5 mg/kg/d) intraperitoneally, starting 7 days after aneurysm preparation to 28 days. AAA dilatation ratio was calculated. Pathologic examination was performed. ROS expression was semi-quantified by dihydroethidium staining and the oxidative product of DNA induced by ROS, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), by immunohistochemical staining. At day 7, ROS expression and 8-OHdG-positive cells in aneurysm walls were decreased by edaravone treatment (ROS expression: 3.0 ± 0.5 in group LD, 1.7 ± 0.3 in group HD, and 4.8 ± 0.7 in group C; 8-OHdG-positive cells: 106.2 ± 7.8 cells in group LD, 64.5 ± 7.7 cells in group HD, and 136.6 ± 7.4 cells in group C; P < .0001), compared with group C. Edaravone treatment significantly reduced messenger RNA expressions of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in aneurysm walls (MMP-2: 1.1 ± 0.5 in group LD, 0.6 ± 0.1 in group HD, and 2.3 ± 0.4 in group C; P < .001; MMP-9: 1.2 ± 0.1 in group LD, 0.2 ± 0.6 in group HD, and 2.4 ± 0.2 in group C; P < .001). At day 28, aortic walls in groups LD and HD were less dilated, with increased wall thickness and elastin content than those in group C (dilatation ratio: 204.7% ± 16.0% in group C, 156.5% ± 6.6% in group LD, 136.7% ± 2.0% in group HD; P < .0001).

"Increased oxidant levels have been associated with exacerbations of COPD, and L-carbocisteine, a mucolytic agent, reduces the frequency of exacerbations. The mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of L-carbocisteine on oxidant-induced COPD exacerbations were examined in an in vitro study of human airway epithelial cells. In order to examine the antioxidant effects of L-carbocisteine, human tracheal epithelial cells were treated with L-carbocisteine and exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Cell apoptosis was assessed using a cell death detection ELISA, and the pathways leading to cell apoptosis were examined by measurement of caspase-3 and caspase-9 by western blot analysis with fluorescent detection. The proportion of apoptotic cells in human tracheal epithelium was increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, following exposure to H(2)O(2). Treatment with L-carbocisteine reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. In contrast, H(2)O(2) did not increase the concentration of LDH in supernatants of epithelial cells. Exposure to H(2)O(2) activated caspase-3 and caspase-9, and L-carbocisteine inhibited the H(2)O(2)-induced activation of these caspases.

"This study sought to test whether transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR) stimulates angiogenesis in an animal model of chronic ischemia. TMLR relieves angina and may also improve blood flow in patients who are not candidates for traditional therapies. The mechanisms of these benefits are not fully defined. Ischemia was created in 14 dogs by proximal left anterior descending coronary ameroid constrictors. TMLR was performed in the anterior wall (approximately 1 channel/cm2) of seven dogs; the remaining dogs served as the ischemic control group. Myocardial blood flow was measured (colored microspheres) at rest and during chemical stress (adenosine) in the acute setting and after 2 months. TMLR did not influence blood flow in the acute setting. After 2 months, resting blood flow increased comparably in the anterior wall in both groups to approximately 80% of normal. However, the TMLR-treated dogs demonstrated an approximately 40% increase in blood flow capacity during stress in the ischemic territory compared with untreated dogs (left anterior descending coronary artery/left circumflex coronary artery flow 0.53+/-0.16 in the control group vs. 0.73+/-0.08 in TMLR animals, p < 0.05). Vascular proliferation, assessed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and proliferating cell nuclear antigen positivity in endothelial and smooth muscle cells was about four times greater in the TMLR group than in the control group (p < 0.001).

"The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the hemodynamic actions of insulin on cutaneous microcirculation in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). A prospective, open-label, nonrandomized, placebo-controlled investigation was performed in an otherwise healthy cohort of persons with SCI (n = 10) and in an age- and sex-matched cohort of control subjects whose neurologic function is intact (n = 10). Laser Doppler flowmetry characterized the peak blood perfusion unit (BPU) response (percent change from baseline) to insulin or placebo iontophoresis above and below the neurologic level of injury. Placebo iontophoresis did not result in any statistically significant changes in BPU. In the arm, insulin iontophoresis resulted in a 20% mean increase in BPU (P < 0.05) in the control group and a 9% mean increase in the SCI group (P = 0.14).

"The nodal status is an established prognostic factor in ampullary carcinoma. The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic power of the anatomic location of positive nodes with that of the number of positive nodes. Of 73 consecutive patients treated for ampullary carcinoma, 62 underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with regional lymphadenectomy. A survival analysis of these 62 patients by nodal status was conducted retrospectively. A total of 1942 lymph nodes taken from the patients were examined histologically for metastasis. The location of positive regional nodes was classified into 4 categories, according to the Japanese staging system. The number of positive regional nodes was recorded for each patient. The median follow-up period was 124 months. Nodal disease was found in 31 patients, of whom 23 had 1-3 positive regional nodes and 8 had >or=4 positive regional nodes. Univariate analysis revealed that both the location (p<0.0001) and the number (p<0.0001) of positive nodes were significant prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis revealed that the number of positive nodes was an independent prognostic factor (p=0.007), while the location failed to remain as an independent variable.

"The purpose of this study was to examine ventilatory parameters, gas exchange, and exercise tolerance in sheep undergoing cardiopulmonary exercise testing and pulmonary function testing at baseline and after induction of emphysema using nebulized papain, to improve our understanding of the contributions of parenchymal emphysema with minimal airway disease to exertional dysfunction in mild-to-moderate emphysema. Static lung physiology (total lung capacity, residual volume, static elastance, and diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide) and lung (ZL) input impedance were measured, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was performed in 12 sheep before and after induction of emphysema. Papain treatment was delivered over a 12-wk period, as a single dose per week, to induce mild-to-moderate emphysema without airway disease. Static and dynamic lung physiology, as well as CPET, were then repeated. At the emphysema time point (EMPH), all animals were asymptomatic for emphysema at rest. There was a 60% increase in residual volume and a 57% decrease in static elastance, accompanied by a 36% reduction in diffusing capacity. Airway resistance was consistently, mildly increased, resulting in an increased expiratory time constant for all sheep at EMPH.

Furthermore, the circulatory protective effect of celastrol on an in vivo animal model of sepsis was investigated. Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory disorder that increases tissue oxidative stress and leads to multiple organ injury. We evaluated the beneficial effects of celastrol on multiple organ failure induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. Celastrol (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) was administered to anaesthetized rats 2 h before and 30 min after LPS challenge (10 mg/kg, i.v.). Eight hours later, cardiac and aortic protein expressions related to inflammatory responses, superoxide anion production, and reduced glutathione (GSH) level were measured. Treatment with celastrol prevented circulatory failure (bradycardia and hypotension) 8h after LPS challenge. The plasma levels of ALT, LDH, TNF-α, and nitric oxide metabolites increased markedly during sepsis, which significantly reduced after celastrol treatments.

"Unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) can be neurotoxic in jaundiced neonates and in patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome. UCB toxicity may culminate in cell death, however, the occurrence of apoptosis has never been investigated. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a strong modulator of the apoptotic threshold in both hepatic and nonhepatic cells. The aims of this study were to determine whether apoptosis plays a role in neural cell death induced by UCB, and to investigate the ability of UDCA to prevent cell death. Cultured rat astrocytes were incubated with UCB (17 and 86 microM) plus albumin (5.7 and 28.7 microM) for 4-22 h. In addition, astrocytes and neurones were treated with either UCB, 50 microM UDCA, or their combination for 4 h. Cultures were scored for nonviable cells by trypan blue dye exclusion. Apoptosis was assessed by Hoechst staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labelling assay. UCB induced a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in astrocyte viability. Apoptosis was 4- and 7-fold increased after 4 h exposure to 17 and 86 microM UCB, respectively (P < 0.01).

"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant human brain neoplasm with limited therapeutic options. GBMs display a deregulated apoptotic pathway with high levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins and overt activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Therefore, combined interference of the PI3K pathway and the Bcl-2 family of proteins is a reasonable therapeutic strategy. ABT-263 (Navitoclax), an orally available small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor, and GDC-0941, a PI3K inhibitor, were used to treat established glioblastoma and glioblastoma neurosphere cells, alone or in combination. Although GDC-0941 alone had a modest effect on cell viability, treatment with ABT-263 displayed a marked reduction of cell viability and induction of apoptotic cell death. Moreover, combinatorial therapy using ABT-263 and GDC-0941 showed an enhanced effect, with a further decrease in cellular viability. Furthermore, combination treatment abrogated the ability of stem cell-like glioma cells to form neurospheres. ABT-263 and GDC-0941, in combination, resulted in a consistent and significant increase of Annexin V positive cells and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential compared with either monotherapy. The combination treatment led to enhanced cleavage of both initiator and effector caspases. Mechanistically, GDC-0941 depleted pAKT (Serine 473) levels and suppressed Mcl-1 protein levels, lowering the threshold for the cytotoxic actions of ABT-263. GDC-0941 decreased Mcl-1 in a posttranslational manner and significantly decreased the half-life of Mcl-1 protein.

"Prolonged hypercapnia is commonly encountered during the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute respiratory failure attributable to other causes with protective ventilation strategies. In these circumstances, compensatory renal buffering returns pH to normal establishing a condition of buffered hypercapnia. It is also common intensive care practice to correct the pH more rapidly using bicarbonate infusions.

In case of thyroid antibody positivity and/or TSH elevation, thyroid gland sonography was performed. Treatment with l-thyroxine was started if persistent elevation of TSH and/or thyroid volume was present. The majority of patients (92.1%) had at least one T1D antibody (71.6% GADA, 73.0% IA2A, and 44.9% IAA). GADA positive patients were older than those without GADA (p < 0.001). Thyroid autoimmunity was found in 15 of 335 patients (4.5%) at T1D onset with female preponderance (p = 0.013). At the end of follow-up, 70 patients (20.9%) had developed thyroid autoantibodies [cumulative incidence (CI) 0.36 ± 0.06 at 10 yr of T1D]. In 30 patients (9.0%), AIT was diagnosed up to 9.4 yr after T1D onset (CI 0.24 ± 0.06 at 10 yr). AIT incidence was not influenced by IAA or IA2A positivity. In multivariate analysis, GADA positive patients were estimated to have a 3.5-fold increased risk of AIT (CI 0.31 ± 0.11 at 10 yr) compared to those without GADA (p = 0.024).",Is gADA positivity at onset of type 1 diabetes a risk factor for the development of autoimmune thyroiditis?,"Based on the present results, a special focus should be given to GADA positive patients concerning screening for AIT as they are at increased risk to develop autoimmune thyroiditis.",0,"Yes, GADA positivity at the onset of type 1 diabetes is a risk factor for the development of autoimmune thyroiditis, with a 3.5-fold increased risk compared to those without GADA.",0.6628786325454712
"Several contraindications for intravenous thrombolysis are not based on controlled trials. Specialized stroke centers often apply less restrictive criteria. The aim of our study was to analyze how many patients at our institution receive off-label thrombolysis. In addition, clinical outcome and safety data were compared to those from patients treated on-label, and the influence of different definitions of 'minor stroke' were examined. Consecutive thrombolysis patients treated between January 2006 and January 2010 were included. Patients treated off-label were compared to patients given on-label therapy according to the European license. Since no specified definition for 'minor neurological deficit' exists in the license, two distinct definitions were considered off-label, i.e. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (NIHSSS) <1 (definition 1) and NIHSSS ≤4 (definition 2). Of a total of 422 patients, 232 (55%) were treated off-label. The most prevalent off-label criteria (OLCs) were the following: age >80 years (n = 113), minor stroke (definition 1, n = 3; definition 2, n = 84), elevated blood pressure necessitating aggressive treatment (n = 75), time window >3 h (n = 71) and major surgery or trauma within the preceding 3 months (n = 20). In group comparisons, off-label patients had an overall worse outcome using definition 1 for minor stroke, while there was no difference when definition 2 was applied. In multivariate analysis, off-label therapy (definition 1) in general and age >80 years were independent predictors of poor outcome. None of the contraindications were associated with an increased bleeding risk.","Are off-label thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke : rate , clinical outcome and safety influenced by the definition of 'minor stroke '?","Off-label therapy is frequently applied at our center and is not associated with higher complication rates.

"Endothelial dysfunction (ED) has been suggested to be associated with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) in dogs. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an important cofactor for production of the endothelium-derived vasodilator nitric oxide (NO). Under conditions of oxidative stress, BH4 is oxidized to the biologically inactive form dihydrobiopterin (BH2). Thus, plasma concentrations of BH2 and BH4 may reflect ED and oxidative stress. To determine plasma concentrations of BH2 and BH4 in dogs with different degrees of MMVD. Eighty-four privately owned dogs grouped according to ACVIM guidelines (37 healthy control dogs including 13 Beagles and 24 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels [CKCSs], 33 CKCSs with MMVD of differing severity including 18 CKCSs [group B1] and 15 CKCSs [group B2], and 14 dogs of different breeds with clinical signs of congestive heart failure [CHF] because of MMVD [group C]). Dogs underwent clinical examination including echocardiography. Plasma concentrations of BH2 and BH4 were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Higher plasma BH4 and BH2 concentrations were found with dogs in CHF compared with all other groups (control, B1 and B2; P ≤ .001). Females had higher concentrations of BH4 and BH4/BH2 (P ≤ .0003). BH4/BH2 was found to decrease with age (P < .0001).

"The mTOR pathway is constitutively activated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). mTOR inhibitors have activity in DLBCL, although response rates remain low. We evaluated DLBCL cell lines with differential resistance to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin: (i) to identify gene expression profile(s) (GEP) associated with resistance to rapamycin, (ii) to understand mechanisms of rapamycin resistance, and (iii) to identify compounds likely to synergize with mTOR inhibitor. We sought to identify a GEP of mTOR inhibitor resistance by stratification of eight DLBCL cell lines with respect to response to rapamycin. Then, using pathway analysis and connectivity mapping, we sought targets likely accounting for this resistance and compounds likely to overcome it. We then evaluated two compounds thus identified for their potential to synergize with rapamycin in DLBCL and confirmed mechanisms of activity with standard immunoassays. We identified a GEP capable of reliably distinguishing rapamycin-resistant from rapamycin-sensitive DLBCL cell lines. Pathway analysis identified Akt as central to the differentially expressed gene network. Connectivity mapping identified compounds targeting Akt as having a high likelihood of reversing the GEP associated with mTOR inhibitor resistance. Nelfinavir and MK-2206, chosen for their Akt-inhibitory properties, yielded synergistic inhibition of cell viability in combination with rapamycin in DLBCL cell lines, and potently inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and downstream targets of activated mTOR.",Do akt inhibitors MK-2206 and nelfinavir overcome mTOR inhibitor resistance in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,GEP identifies DLBCL subsets resistant to mTOR inhibitor therapy.

"Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of collagen and α-smooth muscle actin in the lung. The key molecules that promote these phenotypes are of clinical interest. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been found at high levels in patients with asthma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and TSLP has been proposed as a primary driver of lung fibrotic disease. We asked whether tumor necrosis factor superfamily protein 14 (TNFSF14) (aka LIGHT) controls TSLP production to initiate fibrosis. Expression of TSLP and initiation of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin were assessed in mice deficient in LIGHT. The ability of recombinant LIGHT, given intratracheally to naive mice, to promote TSLP and fibrosis was also determined. Genetic deletion of LIGHT abolished lung TSLP expression driven by bleomycin, accompanied by near-complete absence of accumulation of lung collagen and α-smooth muscle actin. Furthermore, recombinant LIGHT administered in vivo induced lung expression of TSLP in the absence of other inflammatory stimuli, and strikingly reproduced the primary features of bleomycin-driven disease in a TSLP-dependent manner. Blockade of LIGHT binding to either of its receptors, herpes virus entry mediator and lymphotoxin beta receptor, inhibited clinical symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis, and correspondingly both receptors were found on human bronchial epithelial cells, a primary source of TSLP. Moreover, LIGHT induced TSLP directly in human bronchial epithelial cells and synergized with IL-13 and TGF-β in vivo to promote TSLP in the lungs and drive fibrosis.",Does tumor necrosis factor superfamily 14 ( LIGHT ) control thymic stromal lymphopoietin to drive pulmonary fibrosis?,These results show that LIGHT is a profibrogenic cytokine that may be a key driver of TSLP production during the initiation and development of lung fibrotic disease.,0,"Yes, tumor necrosis factor superfamily 14 (LIGHT) controls thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) to drive pulmonary fibrosis.",0.653009831905365

The purpose of this study was to confirm this association in a U.K. population, to determine whether the association holds for both geographic atrophy (GA) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and to investigate interactions with smoking. A case-control study was undertaken in 443 cases of AMD, with 262 spouses as control subjects. All subjects completed a health and lifestyle questionnaire, had an ophthalmic assessment with fundus photography, and were genotyped. The frequencies of the C allele and CC genotype were significantly higher in cases than in controls. In comparison to the TT genotype, the odds ratios for AMD associated with the CT and CC genotypes were 3.1 (CI 2.0-4.6) and 6.3 (CI 3.8-10.4), respectively. The results were similar in subgroup analyses confined to cases with GA or CNV. The findings were also similar for subgroup analyses restricted to subjects who had never smoked, moderate smokers, or heavier smokers (>20 pack years of smoking).

"Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common malignant neoplasm of the urinary tract in children. Although it is curable with long-term survival, the combination of surgery, chemotherapy and often radiotherapy in some cases results in severe complications in adulthood. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies that would decrease treatment burden and improve outcome for high risk patients are required. We evaluated the efficacy of halofuginone, an inhibitor of collagen type I synthesis and angiogenesis, to inhibit WT development in xenografts models. WTs derived from 2 patients with favorable histology at different disease stages were implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically in the kidneys of nude mice. Halofuginone was administered intraperitoneally (2 mug per mouse every other day) or given in the diet (1 part per million). Independent of disease stage, tumor location or administration route, halofuginone caused a decrease in angiogenesis that resulted in marked inhibition of tumor development. This result was accompanied by a reduction in collagen synthesis, reduced levels of hepatocyte growth factor receptor MET and increased levels of the tumor suppressor protein WT1. In culture halofuginone increased the synthesis of WT1 in the human WT cell-line SK-NEP-1 and in other cancer cell lines such as hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer. In SK-NEP-1 halofuginone also lowered erb B2 levels and reduced cell proliferation.",Is inhibition of Wilms tumor xenograft progression by halofuginone accompanied by activation of WT-1 gene expression?,"These results suggest that halofuginone is a potent inhibitor of WT progression.

"Many patients with oncogene-driven non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors experience limited sites of disease progression. This study investigated retrospectively the benefits of local ablative therapy (LAT) to central nervous system (CNS) and/or limited systemic disease progression and continuation of crizotinib or erlotinib in patients with metastatic ALK gene rearrangement (ALK+) or EGFR-mutant (EGFR-MT) NSCLC, respectively. Patients with metastatic ALK+ NSCLC treated with crizotinib (n = 38) and EGFR-MT NSCLC treated with erlotinib (n = 27) were identified at a single institution. Initial response to the respective kinase inhibitors, median progression-free survival (PFS1), and site of first progression were recorded. A subset of patients with either nonleptomeningeal CNS and/or four sites or fewer of extra-CNS progression (oligoprogressive disease) suitable for LAT received either radiation or surgery to these sites and continued on the same tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The subsequent median progression-free survival from the time of first progression (PFS2) and pattern of progression were recorded. Median progression-free survival in ALK+ patients on crizotinib was 9.0 months, and 13.8 months for EGFR-MT patients on erlotinib. Twenty-five of 51 patients (49%) who progressed were deemed suitable for local therapy (15 ALK+, 10 EGFR-MT; 24 with radiotherapy, one with surgery) and continuation of the same targeted therapy.

"Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is a member of the lipocalin superfamily, and it has an important role in the regulation of cellular oncogenesis and apoptosis. However, the role for LCN2 in prostate cancer remains unclear. LCN2 expression has been determined by Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry in the human prostate cell lines PC3, DU145, LNCaP, and 22Rv, and in human prostate tissue array. In this study, we identified shRNA-LCN2 to determine the role of LCN2 in prostate-cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Cell proliferative ability was measured by MTT, colony-formation, and cell-cycle analysis. The role of LCN2 in prostate-cancer cell migration and invasion was analyzed by cell-migration assay and Matrigel invasion assay. The effect of LCN2 knockdown on prostate tumor growth was assessed in a subcutaneous xenograft model. LCN2 protein and mRNA expression are higher in PC3 and DU145 cells than in LNCaP and 22Rv cells, and prostate cancer tissue correlated significantly with tumor differentiation (P < 0.017) and Gleason's grade (P < 0.02). LCN2 knockdown in PC3 and DU145 cells decreased cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle arrest, migration, and invasion. Conversely, LCN2 overexpression in 22Rv cells produced the opposite effect.

"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) has been implicated in regulating many of the genes responsible for angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, glucose metabolism and cancer pathogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that exposure of human breast cancer lines to 17β-oestradiol (E2) rapidly induced the expression of HIF-1α, the regulated subunit of HIF1, in normoxic condition. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α is normally degraded in normoxia through ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis, whereas hypoxia modulates HIF-1α level by inhibiting ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Oestradiol-induced accumulation of HIF-1α in breast cancer lines was detected by western blot analysis and its promoter activity was measured by HIF1 reporter assay. Molecular signalling of oestradiol-mediated HIF-1α expression was studied using specific pharmacological inhibitors and small interference RNA by co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting analysis. Oestradiol has been observed to rapidly activate the nongenomic signalling cascade leading to HIF-1α protein synthesis. The results define a signalling pathway in breast cancer cells whereby oestradiol induces a rapid protein-protein interaction of ERα-c-Src-PI3K, resulting in the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway leading to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation. The mTOR then stimulates translation by phosphorylating p70 S6 kinase and 4EB-P1, modulating HIF-1α protein synthesis. Oestradiol-stimulated HIF-1α activity was inhibited by either siRNA or pharmacological inhibitors to ERα, c-Src, PI3K and mTOR, providing a mechanism for the modulation of HIF-1α protein synthesis.",Does rapid non-genomic signalling by 17β-oestradiol through c-Src involve mTOR-dependent expression of HIF-1α in breast cancer cells?,"These results show oestradiol-induced expression of HIF-1α, downstream of the ERα/c-Src/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in human breast cancer cells.",0,"Yes, rapid non-genomic signaling by 17β-oestradiol through c-Src involves mTOR-dependent expression of HIF-1α in breast cancer cells.",0.7295923829078674
"Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a powerful chemoattractant and pro-inflammatory mediator in several inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis. It acts through its two membrane receptors, BLT1 and BLT2. The aim of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism involved in the proatherogenic effect of LTB4, BLT1 and BLT2 in atherosclerosis. Moreover, we characterized the expression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway and LTB4 receptors in blood and plaques from patients with carotid atherosclerosis. In cultured monocytic cells, LTB4 induced a rapid phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs ERK1/2 and JNK1/2) and PI3K/Akt via BLT1 and BLT2 in a pertussis toxin (PTX)-dependent mechanism (assessed via western blotting) and also increased nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) DNA binding activity (assessed via EMSA) in a MAPK- and reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, LTB4 elicited interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha mRNA overexpression also via BLT1 and BLT2 by a PTX- and NF-kB-dependent mechanism (assessed by real-time PCR), promoting an inflammatory environment. When compared with healthy subjects, patients with carotid atherosclerosis showed a significant increase in the expression of all the components of the 5-LO pathway and BLT1 and BLT2 mRNA (real-time PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and LTB4 plasma levels (ELISA).

"Obstructive uropathy is a significant clinical problem that results in apoptotic renal cell death and progressive renal fibrosis. A number of different inflammatory mediators have been implicated in the pathophysiology of obstruction induced renal injury including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-alpha. The cellular source of obstruction induced renal TNF-alpha production and its relationship to renal inflammatory cell infiltration remain unknown. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and exposed to varying lengths of unilateral ureteral obstruction vs sham operation. The kidneys were harvested following renal injury and evaluated for TNF-alpha mRNA expression (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), TNF-alpha protein production (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), TNF-alpha cellular localization (immunohistochemistry) and leukocyte infiltration (leukocyte staining).

"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a)-induced apoptosis is limited by coactivation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kb)-dependent antiapoptotic genes. Nuclear translocation of NF-kB requires degradation of ubiquitinated phospho-IkB-a by the 26S proteasome. We examined whether inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway enhances TNF-a-induced apoptosis in BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells. Serum-starved BxPC-3 cells (12 hours) were pretreated or not for 50 minutes with PSI (30 m mol/L), a peptide aldehyde known to inhibit specifically the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome. Cells were subsequently stimulated with recombinant human TNF-a (400 units/mL). Western blots were performed using antibodies to IkB-a and phospho-IkB-a. Level of apoptosis was determined by two methods: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of interhistone DNA fragments and flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining. TNF-a-induced degradation of IkB-a was inhibited by PSI. Phospho-IkB-a accumulation was observed 20 minutes after TNF-a stimulation. Apoptosis relative to constitutive levels was significantly increased after PSI pretreatment, as measured by DNA fragmentation (P < or = .05 by Student t test). Percent apoptosis by flow cytometry confirmed marked increases in apoptotic cell fractions from 5.9% (untreated) to 6.8% (TNF-a alone), 16.4% (PSI alone), and 18.9% (PSI and TNF-a).",Does ubiquitin-proteasome inhibition enhance apoptosis of human pancreatic cancer cells?,PSI enhances both constitutive and TNF-a-induced apoptosis through inhibition of IkB-a degradation in BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells.,0,"Yes, ubiquitin-proteasome inhibition enhances apoptosis of human pancreatic cancer cells, as indicated by the effects of the proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052, which increases apoptosis and shifts cells toward G2 cell cycle arrest when combined with chemotherapy.",0.6547276973724365

"Insulin resistance (IR) of the granulosa cells may account for the ovarian dysfunctions observed in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). The underlying mechanism remains largely unresolved. The objective of the study was to investigate the relationship of IR of the granulosa cells with cortisol in the follicular fluid and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (11β-HSD1 and -2) in the granulosa cells in PCOS. Follicular fluid and granulosa cells were collected from non-PCOS and PCOS patients with and without IR to measure cortisol concentration and the amounts of 11β-HSD1 and -2, which were then correlated with IR status. The effects of cortisol on the expression of genes pertinent to IR were studied in cultured human granulosa cells. Cortisol concentration in the follicular fluid, 11β-HSD1 but not 11β-HSD2 mRNA in the granulosa cells were significantly elevated in PCOS with IR. Increased reductase and decreased oxidase activities of 11β-HSD were observed in granulosa cells in PCOS with IR.

"Since vanadium complexes have insulin-mimetic effects and can be used to treat complications of diabetes, we aimed to screen a new oxovanadium complex with a low toxicity, and investigate its insulin-mimetic effects, as well as the mechanism of improvement to diabetic mouse renal function. Cells were treated with oxovanadium complexes, and viability was assessed by MTT assay. Diabetic mouse model was established using alloxan. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) in the mice were measured using an automatic biochemical analyzer, and blood glucose was measured using a Glucoval Compact meter. Expression of proteins related to the insulin signaling pathway in the renal cortex of mice was measured by Western blot analysis. Diabetic mice developed high blood glucose, BUN and SCr levels compared with control mice.

"We have shown that compared with silybin, 2,3-dehydrosilybin (DHS) exhibits more potent in vitro anticancer activities alone or in combination with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Since TNF-alpha sensitization is related to DNA topoisomerase (topo) inhibition, DHS may be a potent topo inhibitor. Under significant apoptosis induction by DHS, we measured specific topo I activity in nuclear extracts or purified enzyme. Treatment of more transformed FIB cells with 30 microM DHS for 24 h caused significant decreases in topo I activity in nuclear extracts while silybin did not have any effects. Less transformed EPI cells were more resistant against DHS-induced topo I inhibition. Inhibitory effects of topo I activity by DHS were also found in cell-free assays using purified topo I, whereas silybin again did not have any effects.","Is 2,3-dehydrosilybin a better DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor than its parental silybin?",DHS is a potent topo I inhibitor rendering its ability to sensitize TNF-alpha for enhanced cytotoxicity.,0,"Yes, 2,3-dehydrosilybin (DHS) is a more potent DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor than its parental compound silybin.",0.6323115229606628
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with TNBC have a higher risk of lymph node (LN) metastases. A prospective database review identified 3,289 patients treated with a mastectomy or with breast-conserving surgery between January 2000 and May 2012. The final analysis included those patients who underwent sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and/or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and the following information: age at diagnosis, tumor size, grade, stage, histologic subtype, presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and the status of estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). A total of 2,967 patients met the inclusion criteria. SNB was performed in 1,094 patients, ALND in 756, and both SNB and ALND in 1,117 patients. LN metastases were detected in 1,050 (35 %) patients. On univariate analysis, the LN positivity varied across subtypes with 33 % in luminal A, 42 % in luminal B, 39 % in TNBC, and 45 % in HER-2 (p = 0.0007). However, on multivariable analysis, there was no difference in LN positivity among subtypes. Age <50, grade 2 or 3 tumors, size ≥2 cm, and presence of LVI were significant predictors of LN positivity.

"PDZK1 is a four PDZ-domain containing protein that binds to the carboxy terminus of the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and regulates its expression, localization and function in a tissue-specific manner. PDZK1 knockout (KO) mice are characterized by a marked reduction of SR-BI protein expression ( approximately 95%) in the liver (lesser or no reduction in other organs) with a concomitant 1.7 fold increase in plasma cholesterol. PDZK1 has been shown to be atheroprotective using the high fat/high cholesterol ('Western') diet-fed murine apolipoprotein E (apoE) KO model of atherosclerosis, presumably because of its role in promoting reverse cholesterol transport via SR-BI. Here, we have examined the effects of PDZK1 deficiency in apoE KO mice fed with the atherogenic 'Paigen' diet for three months. Relative to apoE KO, PDZK1/apoE double KO (dKO) mice showed increased plasma lipids (33% increase in total cholesterol; 49 % increase in unesterified cholesterol; and 36% increase in phospholipids) and a 26% increase in aortic root lesions. Compared to apoE KO, dKO mice exhibited substantial occlusive coronary artery disease: 375% increase in severe occlusions. Myocardial infarctions, not observed in apoE KO mice (although occasional minimal fibrosis was noted), were seen in 7 of 8 dKO mice, resulting in 12 times greater area of fibrosis in dKO cardiac muscle.",Does loss of PDZK1 cause coronary artery occlusion and myocardial infarction in Paigen diet-fed apolipoprotein E deficient mice?,These results show that Paigen-diet fed PDZK1/apoE dKO mice represent a new animal model useful for studying coronary heart disease and suggest that PDZK1 may represent a valuable target for therapeutic intervention.,0,"The provided context does not mention PDZK1 or its effects on coronary artery occlusion and myocardial infarction in Paigen diet-fed apolipoprotein E deficient mice.

"Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) predisposed to recurrent coronary events have an expansion of a distinctive T-cell subset, the CD4(+)CD28(null) T cells. These cells are highly inflammatory and cytotoxic in spite of lacking the costimulatory receptor CD28, which is crucial for optimal T cell function. The mechanisms that govern CD4(+)CD28(null) T cell function are unknown. Our aim was to investigate the expression and role of alternative costimulatory receptors in CD4(+)CD28(null) T cells in ACS. Expression of alternative costimulatory receptors (inducible costimulator, OX40, 4-1BB, cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4, programmed death-1) was quantified in CD4(+)CD28(null) T cells from circulation of ACS and stable angina patients. Strikingly, in ACS, levels of OX40 and 4-1BB were significantly higher in circulating CD4(+)CD28(null) T cells compared to classical CD4(+)CD28(+) T lymphocytes. This was not observed in stable angina patients. Furthermore, CD4(+)CD28(null) T cells constituted an important proportion of CD4(+) T lymphocytes in human atherosclerotic plaques and exhibited high levels of OX40 and 4-1BB. In addition, the ligands for OX40 and 4-1BB were present in plaques and also expressed on monocytes in circulation.

"The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of glimepiride on insulin sensitivity and secretion in subjects with type 2 diabetes. After a 2-week washout from prior sulfonylurea therapy, 11 obese subjects with type 2 diabetes underwent euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp studies before and during glimepiride therapy. Glimepiride resulted in a 2.4-mmol/l decrease in fasting plasma glucose (P = 0.04) that was correlated with reductions in postabsorptive endogenous glucose production (EGP) (16.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 13.5 +/- 0.5 micro mol. kg(-1). min(-1), P = 0.01) (r = 0.21, P = 0.01).

"Metabolomics has the potential to reveal novel pathways involved in the pathogenesis of preterm birth (PTB). The objective of this study was to investigate whether the cervicovaginal (CV) metabolome was different in asymptomatic women destined to have a PTB compared with term birth. A nested case-control study was performed using CV fluid collected from a larger prospective cohort. The CV fluid was collected between 20-24 weeks (V1) and 24-28 weeks (V2). The metabolome was compared between women with a spontaneous PTB (n = 10) to women who delivered at term (n = 10). Samples were extracted and prepared for analysis using a standard extraction solvent method. Global biochemical profiles were determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. An ANOVA was used to detect differences in biochemical compounds between the groups. A false discovery rate was estimated to account for multiple comparisons. A total of 313 biochemicals were identified in CV fluid.

"In addition to the primary symptoms arising from inflamed joints, muscle weakness is prominent and frequent in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we investigated the mechanisms of arthritis-induced muscle dysfunction in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). AIA was induced in the knees of rats by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant and was allowed to develop for 21 days. Muscle contractile function was assessed in isolated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles. To assess mechanisms underlying contractile dysfunction, we measured redox modifications, redox enzymes and inflammatory mediators, and activity of actomyosin ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase. EDL muscles from AIA rats showed decreased tetanic force per cross-sectional area and slowed twitch contraction and relaxation. These contractile dysfunctions in AIA muscles were accompanied by marked decreases in actomyosin ATPase and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase activities. Actin aggregates were observed in AIA muscles, and these contained high levels of 3-nitrotyrosine and malondialdehyde-protein adducts. AIA muscles showed increased protein expression of NADPH oxidase 2/gp91(phox), neuronal nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). Treatment of AIA rats with EUK-134 (3 mg/kg/day), a superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic, prevented both the decrease in tetanic force and the formation of actin aggregates in EDL muscles without having any beneficial effect on the arthritis development.",Is muscle dysfunction associated with adjuvant-induced arthritis prevented by antioxidant treatment?,Antioxidant treatment prevented the development of oxidant-induced actin aggregates and contractile dysfunction in the skeletal muscle of AIA rats. This implies that antioxidant treatment can be used to effectively counteract muscle weakness in inflammatory conditions.,1,"No, antioxidant treatment did not modify the clinical features of the disease or prevent muscle dysfunction associated with adjuvant-induced arthritis in the study.",0.7008646726608276
"The decision to commence lifelong glucocorticoid replacement therapy is often based on a cortisol stimulation test. We investigated the relationship between the peak cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and daily cortisol production rate (CPR) to ascertain whether provocative tests are accurate in indicating the need to initiate lifelong glucocorticoid replacement. Ten patients (five male; mean age, 44 +/- 13 yr) with pituitary disease and with demonstrably suboptimal peak cortisol response (350-500 nmol/liter) to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, underwent CPR measurement by isotope dilution using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 24-h urinary free cortisol (UFC). The median baseline and peak cortisol attained with hypoglycemia were 284 (164-323) and 473.5 (366-494) nmol/liter, respectively. A strong positive correlation was seen between peak stimulated cortisol and CPR (adjusted for body surface area) (r = 0.75; P = 0.02), and in all patients CPR [4.6 (2.9-15.1) mg/d x m(2)] was within the reference range (2.1-12 mg/d x m(2)) or elevated (one patient). A wide range was found for 24-h UFC [116.5 (20.5-265.9) nmol/liter] in this group of patients, and this parameter lacked significant correlation with either serum cortisol concentration or CPR.",Does a subnormal peak cortisol response to stimulation testing predict a subnormal cortisol production rate?,"This is the first study to demonstrate a significant correlation between CPR and peak cortisol values during hypoglycemic challenge. An inadequate cortisol response to hypoglycemia suggests the need for glucocorticoid cover at times of stress, but these data indicate that a suboptimal peak cortisol does not equate to a low CPR and should not be an automatic indication for lifelong glucocorticoid replacement therapy. UFC bears no relation to serum cortisol or CPR and is therefore unhelpful in assessment of such patients.",1,"No, a subnormal peak cortisol response to stimulation testing does not predict a subnormal cortisol production rate, as evidenced by the study where patients with a suboptimal peak cortisol response had cortisol production rates within the reference range or elevated.",0.6433088779449463
"Research for infectious agents in the etiology of atherosclerosis has identified Chlamydia pneumoniae as a possible candidate. While there is evidence of an association between presence of this microorganism and atherosclerosis, it is unclear whether infection has a genuinely etiologic role in this disease, whether its presence influences clinical outcomes, and, if so, at which stages of disease this occurs. We have approached this issue in patients with advanced carotid artery atherosclerosis using molecular biological detection methods and clinically relevant indicators of pathology in carotid artery atheroma to determine whether the presence of C pneumoniae correlates with plaque instability. C pneumoniae was detected with the use of a sensitive nested polymerase chain reaction. Preoperative embolization and preoperative infarcts were recorded with the use of transcranial Doppler insonation of the middle cerebral artery and cerebral CT, respectively. C pneumoniae DNA was detected in 25.5% of a cohort of 98 symptomatic patients.

A retrospective chart review of prehospital advanced life support patients was performed on confirmed opioid overdose patients. Initial and final unassisted respiratory rates (RR) and GCS, recorded by paramedics, were used as indicators of naloxone effectiveness. The median changes in RR and GCS were determined. Three hundred forty-four patients who received naloxone by paramedics from January 1, 2005, until December 31, 2007, were evaluated. Of confirmed opioid overdoses, change in RR was 6 for the IV group and 4 for the IN group (P = .08). Change in GCS was 4 for the IV group and 3 for the IN group (P = .19).

"Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) represents the earliest and severest form of retinal dystrophy leading to congenital blindness. A total of 20% of children attending blind schools have this disease. LCA has a multigenic basis and is proving central to our understanding of the development of the retina. We describe the clinical and molecular genetic features of four inbred pedigrees from neighbouring remote villages in northern Pakistan, in which some of the affected members have concurrent keratoconus. History-taking and physical and eye examinations were performed in the field. Venipuncture, DNA extraction, studies of linkage to known LCA genes, automated sequencing and polymorphism analyses for haplotype assessments were done. We examined 12 affected and 15 unaffected family members. By history, there were an additional nine blind people in the four pedigrees. In each pedigree a consanguineous marriage was evident. We found a homozygous nonsense mutation in the AIPL1 gene, which replaces a tryptophan with a stop codon (Trp278X). The phenotype is severe and variable, despite the common molecular genetic etiology in each family.

"Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly complicates chronic bacterial otitis in dogs. The aim of this in vitro study was to determine the effect of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-tromethamine (Tris-EDTA) on the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of marbofloxacin and gentamicin for multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates from cases of canine otitis. Eleven isolates were identified as multidrug resistant on disc diffusion; 10 were resistant to marbofloxacin and two were resistant to gentamicin. Isolates were incubated for 90 min with each antibiotic alone and in combination with Tris-EDTA at concentrations of 0.075 μg/mL to 5 mg/mL for marbofloxacin, 0.001 μg/mL to 10 mg/mL for gentamicin and 17.8:4.7 to 0.14:0.04 mg/mL for Tris-EDTA. Positive and negative controls were included. Aliquots of each antibiotic and/or Tris-EDTA concentration were subsequently transferred to sheep blood agar to determine the MBCs, and tryptone soy broth was added to the remaining suspensions to determine the MICs. Tris-EDTA alone was bacteriostatic but not bactericidal at any concentration.

"To determine how much vitamin A is consumed through liver and liver products by non-pregnant and pregnant women aged 16-50 years, and to determine the implications for the use of multivitamin products. Secondary analysis on data from representative database Dutch National Food Consumption Survey. Data were obtained from a Dutch National Food Consumption Survey (1992, method published earlier) regarding 1725 non-pregnant and 58 pregnant women aged 16-50 years who did or did not consume liver and (or) liver products. Average daily vitamin A intake (two consecutive days), was 850 retinol equivalents (RE) for non-pregnant and 990 RE for pregnant women, respectively (recommended daily allowances are 800 RE and 1000 RE). Average intakes of those not eating liver or liver products were 540 RE and 720 RE per day. In about 70% and 50% of the women respectively the intake was below the minimal requirement of 600 RE per day. The use of a vitamin A supplement providing 1200 RE per day among the non-liver users would in none of the cases have resulted in intakes higher than the threshold level of 7500 RE for teratogenic risks. Occasionally in 2-3% of the women, not using liver or liver products, maximum intake would exceed 3000 RE per day (the upper safe limit of intake according to the Dutch Health Council/Nutrition Council Committee).

"NPHS1, which encodes nephrin, recently has been identified as the gene in which mutations cause congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (CNF). We previously reported novel missense mutations of NPHS1 in a Japanese patient with CNF. However, the mechanism by which these missense mutations cause the disorder remains to be clarified. Wild-type nephrin and mutated nephrin complementary DNA were each tagged by the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene; the expressing vectors of the fusion protein were each transfected to human embryonic kidney 293 cells. We compared intracellular localization of mutated nephrin with that of wild-type nephrin by using GFP and immunostaining examination. In both wild-type and mutated nephrin (Glu(447)Lys), GFP and immunostaining resulted in a colocalized microgranular pattern along the cell membrane that indicated these recombinant proteins were located at the cell surface. Conversely, in mutated nephrin (Asp(819)Val), GFP aggregation was observed in the cytoplasm, and no fluorescence was observed at the cell membrane, indicating that recombinant mutated nephrin (Asp(819)Val) could not be distributed at the cell membrane and instead was retained in cytoplasm.",Does a missense mutation in the nephrin gene impair membrane targeting?,"We confirmed that the missense mutation GAC-to-GTC transversion leading to an Asp(819)Val caused the disorder.

"Ischemia-induced acute renal failure (ARF) is known to be associated with significant impairment of urinary concentrating ability and down-regulation of renal aquaporins (AQPs) and sodium transporters in rats. We tested whether treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) or alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in combination with EPO reduces the renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and prevents the down-regulation of renal AQPs and major sodium transporters. I/R-induced ARF was established in rats by 40-minute temporary bilateral obstruction of renal arteries, and rats were kept in metabolic cages for urine measurements. After 2 or 4 days following EPO and/or alpha-MSH treatment, kidneys were removed to determine the expression levels of AQPs and sodium transporters by semiquantitative immunoblotting. Rats with ARF showed significant renal insufficiency, increased urine output, and high fractional excretion of urinary sodium. Consistent with this, immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry revealed that the kidney expression of AQPs (AQP-1, -2 and -3) and sodium transporters [Na,K-ATPase, rat type 1 bumetanide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (BSC-1), Na/H exchanger type 3 (NHE3), and thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (TSC)] in ARF rats was significantly decreased compared to sham-operated control rats. In contrast, EPO treatment at the time of ischemia of rats with ARF significantly prevented the ischemia-induced down-regulation of renal AQPs and sodium transporters and in parallel improved the urinary concentrating capability and renal sodium reabsorption. Importantly, similar effects were observed following the initiation of EPO or alpha-MSH treatment 4 hours after the onset of ischemia injury. Moreover, the combination of EPO with alpha-MSH potentiated the beneficial effects of single compound treatment.",Do ePO and alpha-MSH prevent ischemia/reperfusion-induced down-regulation of AQPs and sodium transporters in rat kidney?,EPO and/or alpha-MSH treatment significantly prevent I/R-induced injuries such as urinary-concentrating defects and down-regulation of renal AQPs and sodium transporters.,1,"Yes, EPO and alpha-MSH prevent ischemia/reperfusion-induced down-regulation of aquaporins (AQPs) and sodium transporters in rat kidneys.",0.7725341320037842
"Hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose-based bioresorbable membrane (HC membrane; Seprafilm(®)) is used to prevent postoperative adhesion. We conducted this study to assess the effectiveness of the HC membrane in reducing the severity of adhesions in patients undergoing unplanned re-laparotomy. Between February, 2002 and December, 2010, 123 patients underwent abdominal surgery followed by a re-laparotomy in Kumamoto Regional Medical Center. The HC membrane was placed under the first abdominal incision in 60 patients (HC membrane group), whereas it was not used in the other 63 patients (control group). We compared the medical and operative records of these two groups. At the second laparotomy, adhesion under the incision was severe in many of the control group patients, but was significantly reduced in the HC membrane group. Postoperative small-bowel obstruction was significantly less frequent in the HC membrane group. According to univariate analysis of the risk factors for adhesion, prolonged operation time, blood loss, and not using an HC membrane were significantly associated with severe adhesion.

"Evidence from both clinical and experimental research indicates that the immune-brain interaction plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of depression. A multi-protein complex of the innate immune system, the NLRP3 inflammasome regulates cleavage and secretion of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. The inflammasome detects various pathogen-associated molecule patterns and damage-associated molecule patterns, which then leads to a series of immune-inflammatory reactions. To explore the role of inflammasome activation in the underlying biological mechanisms of depression, we established a mouse model of depression with unpredictable chronic mild stress. Mice subjected to chronic mild stress for 4 weeks had significantly higher serum corticosterone levels, serum interleukin-1β levels, and hippocampal active interleukin-1β protein levels. They also displayed depressive-like symptoms, including decreased sucrose preference and increased immobility time. Moreover, the hippocampi of chronic mild stress-exposed mice had significantly higher activity of caspase-1, which accompanied by higher protein levels of NLRP3 and the apoptotic speck-containing protein with a card. Pretreatment with the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor VX-765 decreased serum and hippocampal levels of interleukin-1β protein and significantly moderated the depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic mild stress.",Does nLRP3 Inflammasome mediate Chronic Mild Stress-Induced Depression in Mice via Neuroinflammation?,These data suggest the NLRP3 inflammasome mediates stress-induced depression via immune activation.

"Self-perception of changes in body fat among HIV+ persons is associated with decreased health related quality of life in cross-sectional studies. The longitudinal impact of body fat changes on health related quality of life, while accounting for comorbidity and anatomic location or severity of body fat changes, is unknown. This was a longitudinal analysis of HIV+ and HIV- Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) participants who completed questionnaires assessing self-perceived body fat changes (baseline visit) and a health related quality of life (Short Form-36) at baseline and then ≥5 years later. Relationships between body fat changes and change in Short Form-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores were investigated using mixed-model regression. We studied 270 HIV+ and 247 HIV- men. At baseline, ≥50% of HIV+ men reported body fat changes; physical component but not mental component summary scores were lower among HIV+ men who reported moderate/severe leg or abdominal fat changes (p<0.05). At follow-up, physical component summary scores were significantly lower among men with face, leg, or abdominal fat changes compared to men without perceived fat changes (p<0.05). No significant changes were seen in mental component scores by fat change location or severity. In the final model, body fat changes at any site or severity were significant predictors of a decline in physical component summary score (p<0.05), independent of demographics or comorbidities.

"Deep dermal and full-thickness burn wounds are excised and grafted with split-thickness skin grafts. Especially in less compliant patients such as young children, conventional fixing methods can often be ineffective due to high mobility rates in this age group. The aim of this retrospective single-centre study was to give an overview of our experience in the fixation of autologous split-thickness skin grafts (ASTSGs) on burn wounds by negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in paediatric patients. A retrospective analysis describing 53 paediatric patients with burns or burn-related injuries who were treated as 60 individual cases were conducted. All patients received ASTSGs secured by NPWT. Of the individual cases, 60 cases with a mean age of 8±6 years (the youngest was 3 months, the eldest was 24 years old) were treated in a single procedure with ASTSG and NPWT. Total burn surface area (TBSA) was, median (med) 4.5% (3.0-12.0%). The TBSA of deep dermal thickness to full-thickness (IIb-III°) burns was med 4.0% (2.0-6.0%). The TBSA treated with ASTSG and NPWT was med 3.5% (2.0-6.0%). Take rate was, med 96% (90-99%) with a total range of 70-100%.

SH-SY5Y cells were pre-incubated with various concentrations of compound FLZ for 30 min and then cultivated with Abeta25-35 (25 micromol/L) for 48 h to induce neurotoxicity. Cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and the glutathione (GSH) level were determined by a biochemical analysis. The cell apoptotic ratio and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level were measured by a flow cytometry analysis. The expression of apoptosis protein (Bcl-2 and Bax) and cytochrome c release were assayed by the Western blot method. The pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with FLZ (1 and 10 micromol/L) markedly increased cell viability and decreased LDH release and morphological injury.

"A third of the population are estimated to have NAFLD of varying severity. Serum immunoglobulins are frequently elevated in patients with chronic liver disease, but little is known about serum immunoglobulin levels in patients with NAFLD. Aim of this study was to evaluate serum immunoglobulin levels (IgA, IgG, and IgM) in a large cohort of patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and determine if immunoglobulin levels are associated with clinical or histological features. Patients seen in a tertiary fatty liver clinic between 1999 and 2009 were included. Liver biopsies were assessed using the Kleiner score. Immunoglobulin levels and other blood tests were taken at time of biopsy. 285 patients (110 simple steatosis and 175 NASH) had serum immunoglobulins measured within 6months of liver biopsy. 130 (46%) patients had elevated (>1× upper limit of normal) serum IgA levels, 28 (10%) patients had elevated IgG and 22 (8%) raised IgM. Serum IgA levels were elevated more frequently in patients with NASH compared with subjects with simple steatosis (55% vs. 31%, p<0.001). Overall, 55 (19%) patients had advanced liver fibrosis (Kleiner stage 3-4). There was a significant positive association between serum IgA levels and the stage of fibrosis (p<0.001).

"Platelets play a crucial role in the development of arterial thrombosis and other pathophysiologies leading to clinical ischemic events. Defective regulation of platelet activation/aggregation is a predominant cause for arterial thrombosis. The purposes of our study are to assess the effect of androgen at physiological concentration via its receptor on oxidative-stress-induced platelet aggregation and to further elucidate the possible mechanism. Plasma dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was determined by ELISA using a commercially available kit. Platelet aggregometer was used to measure platelet aggregation. The contents of thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) were assayed with radio-immunoassay. Our results showed that addition of DHT (2 nM) significantly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) (10 mM, 25 mM) in PRP diluted with Tyrode's buffer. Moreover, H(2)O(2)-induced platelet aggregation decreased in sham-operated rats. However, H(2)O(2)-induced platelet aggregation significantly increased in castrated rats. Replacement of DHT inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced platelet aggregation in castrated rats. After PRP was pretreated with flutamide, H(2)O(2)-induced platelet aggregation increased in castrated rats again. Presence of DHT (2 nM) obviously inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) release in castrated rats. Pretreatment of DHT and flutamide increased H(2)O(2)-stimulated TXA(2) release from platelet in castrated rats again. Castration caused a significant reduction in plasma testosterone and DHT levels, whereas DHT replaced at a dose of 0.25 mg/rat restored the circulating DHT to physiological levels, without being altered by treatment with flutamide. The plasma TXB(2) increased in castrated rats as compared with that in sham-operated rats. Replacement with DHT reduced plasma TXB(2) contents in castrated rats.

"The causes of increased risk of sudden cardiac death in schizophrenia are not resolved. We aimed to establish (1) whether ECG markers of sudden cardiac death risk, in particular Brugada-ECG pattern, are more prevalent among patients with schizophrenia, and (2) whether increased prevalence of these ECG markers in schizophrenia is explained by confounding factors, notably sodium channel-blocking medication. In a cross-sectional study, we analyzed ECGs of a cohort of 275 patients with schizophrenia, along with medication use. We determined whether Brugada-ECG was present and assessed standard ECG measures (heart rate, PQ-, QRS-, and QT-intervals). We compared the findings with nonschizophrenic individuals of comparable age (the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety [NESDA] cohort; N=179) and, to account for assumed increased aging rate in schizophrenia, with individuals 20 years older (Hoorn cohort; n=1168), using multivariate regression models. Brugada-ECG was significantly more prevalent in the schizophrenia cohort (11.6%) compared with NESDA controls (1.1%) or Hoorn controls (2.4%).

"The proteins of the Mcm2-7 family are required for the initiation of DNA replication. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the nuclear envelope does not break down during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Large nuclear proteins, such as the Mcm proteins, which accumulate in the nucleus during specific portions of the cell cycle, must have regulated mechanisms to direct their entry into the nucleus. We have identified a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in Mcm3, and demonstrated that it is necessary for the translocation of Mcm3 into the nucleus and sufficient for directing Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase to the nucleus. Immediately adjacent to the nuclear localization sequence are four potential sites for phosphorylation by Cdc28. Mutagenesis of all four sites has no immediate phenotypic effect on cell growth or viability, nor does it affect nuclear accumulation of Mcm3, although two-dimensional protein gel analysis has shown that at least some of these sites are normally phosphorylated in vivo. Substitution of the Mcm3 NLS by the SV40 large T-antigen NLS also directs the nuclear accumulation of the Mcm3-T-antigen protein, although cell growth is compromised.

"MicroRNA (miRNA)-126 (miR-126) is an endothelial-specific miRNA located within intron 7 of epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7). However, the role of miR-126 in cancer is controversial. We examined the function of miR-126 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Furthermore, a series of 118 cases with OSCC were evaluated for the expression levels of miR-126. MicroRNA-126 (miR-126) was associated with cell growth and regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor-A activity, and demethylation treatment increased expression levels of miR-126 and EGFL7 in OSCC cells. A significant association was found between miR-126 expression and tumour progression, nodal metastasis, vessel density, or poor prognosis in OSCC cases. In the multivariate analysis, decreased miR-126 expression was strongly correlated with disease-free survival.",Does downregulation of miR-126 induce angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by activation of VEGF-A in oral cancer?,The present results suggest that miR-126 might be a useful diagnostic and therapeutic target in OSCC.,1,"Yes, downregulation of miR-126 is associated with increased angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in oral cancer, likely through the activation of VEGF-A.",0.6799447536468506
"Dipyridamole stress transesophageal echocardiography (STEE) is a feasible method for the evaluation of coronary flow velocity reserve (CFR). The aim of the present study was to investigate CFR in hypertensive patients with or without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The study comprised 73 patients with a negative coronary angiogram (29 men and 44 women). Three different groups were compared: normotensive patients, hypertensive patients without LVH and hypertensive patients with LVH. CFR was significantly decreased in patients with hypertension with LVH as compared to normotensive cases (2.19+/-0.50 vs 2.71+/-1.10; p<0.05). CFR of hypertensive patients without LVH was only slightly reduced as compared to normotensive cases (2.44+/-0.81 vs 2.71+/-1.10; p=ns). In hypertensive patients with LVH, the LV mass and LV mass index were inversely related to CFR (r = -0.481 and -0.477, p<0.05, respectively).",Is coronary flow velocity reserve diminished in hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy?,CFR is diminished in patients with hypertension. The degree of CFR reduction is related to the extent of LVH.,1,"The provided context does not explicitly state that coronary flow velocity reserve is diminished in hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). However, it does indicate that hypertensive patients with LVH have increased central aortic stiffness and other cardiovascular risk factors, which could potentially affect coronary flow dynamics.

"The mechanistic role of the ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF1 in glucocorticoid-induced muscle wasting is not fully understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy is at least in part linked to atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression and that the ubiquitin ligases are regulated by compensatory mechanisms. The expression of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 was suppressed individually or in combination in cultured L6 myotubes by using siRNA technique. Myotubes were treated with dexamethasone followed by determination of mRNA and protein levels for atrogin-1 and MuRF1, protein synthesis and degradation rates, and myotube morphology. Suppression of atrogin-1 resulted in increased expression of MuRF1 and vice versa, suggesting that the ubiquitin ligases are regulated by compensatory mechanisms. Simultaneous suppression of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 resulted in myotube hypertrophy, mainly reflecting stimulated protein synthesis, and prevented dexamethasone-induced myotube atrophy, mainly reflecting inhibited protein degradation.",Does suppression of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 prevent dexamethasone-induced atrophy of cultured myotubes?,The results provide evidence for a link between upregulated atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression and glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy. The study also suggests that atrogin-1 and MuRF1 levels are regulated by compensatory mechanisms and that inhibition of both ubiquitin ligases may be needed to prevent glucocorticoid-induced muscle proteolysis and atrophy.,1,"Yes, simultaneous suppression of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 prevents dexamethasone-induced atrophy of cultured myotubes, mainly by stimulating protein synthesis and inhibiting protein degradation.",0.7135117053985596
"Inadequate antibiotic therapy and failure to administer antibiotics in a timely fashion have been associated with substantial mortality rates in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We analyzed the infection pattern in solid organ transplant recipients as well as the impact of antibiotic resistance and inadequate antibiotic treatment on mortality rates and morbidity outcomes. Charts of adult solid organ transplant recipients in 2006 from a single institution were reviewed. Data on patients with bacterial and fungal infections acquired within one year after transplantation were compared with the primary outcome of death within 28 days. Statistical analysis included nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon rank sum, Fisher exact, and chi-square) and multivariable logistic regression with p < 0.05 considered significant. Of the 366 patients, 114 (31%) had a total of 208 bacterial or fungal infections, and 44 of them (39%) were admitted to the ICU. Our primary endpoint, the 28-day mortality rate, was 8% overall, whereas the six-month mortality rate was 11%. Patients treated inadequately with antibiotics had a significantly higher mortality rate. The leading causes of infection were multiple organisms, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and E. coli, of which 76% were resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections were associated with longer hospital stays (p = 0.04), intravenous antibiotic use prior to infection (p = 0.04), nucleotide synthesis inhibitor use (p = 0.02), ICU admission (p < 0.01), and respiratory failure (p = 0.03). Most infections were treated inadequately initially (69%) but treated adequately at 24 h (56%). Inadequate antibiotic treatment was significantly associated with younger age (p = 0.04), prior intravenous antibiotic use (p = 0.04), longer stay prior to infection (p = 0.05), and cardiovascular shock (p = 0.014).

"We have previously shown that diabetic rats are more susceptible to sepsis, but that the Acute lung injury (ALI) secondary to sepsis is less intense than in non-diabetics. In the present study, we further investigated the ALI-secondary to sepsis in diabetic rats and the effect of insulin treatment. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by alloxan and sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture surgery (CLP). Some diabetic rats were given neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin (4 IU, s.c.) 2 h before CLP. Six h later, the lungs were examined for edema, cell infiltration and prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The results confirmed that leukocyte infiltration and edema were milder in diabetic rats with sepsis. After insulin treatment, the lung inflammation in diabetics increased to levels comparable to the non-diabetics. The BAL concentration of PGE2 was also lower in diabetics with sepsis, and increased after insulin treatment. Sepsis was followed by early fibroblast activation in the lung parenchyma, evaluated by increased transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, as well as an elevated number of cells with myofibroblasts morphology. These events were significantly lower in diabetic rats and increased after insulin treatment.",Is sepsis-induced lung inflammation modulated by insulin?,The results show that insulin modulates the early phase of inflammation and myofibroblast differentiation in diabetic rats.,1,"Yes, sepsis-induced lung inflammation is modulated by insulin.

"The purpose of the present paper was to investigate the effect of gene transfer of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary hypertension in immature rabbits. Immature rabbits (1 month old) were divided into control group (intratracheal injection of normal saline), BLM group (intratracheal injection of BLM), liposome group (intratracheal injection of BLM and liposomes) and the trans-gene group (intratracheal injection of BLM and DNA-liposome complex). The pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) were measured by microcatheter, the pathological changes and the expression of VEGFmRNA and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA of endothelial cells in pulmonary arteries were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and in situ hybridization. The PAP of the BLM and liposome groups were higher than the PAP of the control and trans-gene groups. The thickness of wall increased and the cavity became narrow, and thickness index and area index increased in mid- and small-sized pulmonary arteries of the BLM and liposome groups. VEGF trans-gene was able to reduce those changes; the level of VEGFmRNA and eNOSmRNA expression in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells decreased in the BLM and liposome groups.

"Analysis of a microRNA (miRNA) expression signature of bladder cancer (BC) by deep-sequencing revealed that clustered miRNAs microRNA (miR)-451a, miR-144-3p, and miR-144-5p were significantly downregulated in BC tissues. We hypothesised that these miRNAs function as tumour suppressors in BC. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional roles of these miRNAs and their modulation of cancer networks in BC cells. The functional studies of BC cells were performed using transfection of mature miRNAs. Genome-wide gene expression analysis, in silico analysis, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were applied to identify miRNA targets. The association between miR-144-5p levels and expression of the target genes was determined, and overall patient survival as a function of target gene expression was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Gain-of-function studies showed that miR-144-5p significantly inhibited cell proliferation by BC cells. Four cell cycle-related genes (CCNE1, CCNE2, CDC25A, and PKMYT1) were identified as direct targets of miR-144-5p. The patients with high CCNE1 or CCNE2 expression had lower overall survival probabilities than those with low expression (P=0.025 and P=0.032).",Does tumour-suppressive microRNA-144-5p directly target CCNE1/2 as potential prognostic markers in bladder cancer?,miR-144-5p functions as tumour suppressor in BC cells.

"Overfeeding is associated with insulin resistance. Studies on animals suggest this is likely due to disruption of fatty acid metabolism and increased plasma free fatty acid (FFA) availability during the night. We tested the hypothesis that overfeeding induces insulin resistance and increases nocturnal but not daytime plasma FFA availability in human subjects. We measured plasma glucose, insulin, and FFA concentrations hourly for 24 h during a day of isocaloric feeding and a day of hypercaloric feeding (30% calorie excess) in 8 overweight and obese, nondiabetic men (age: 38±3 years; body mass index: 34±2 kg/m²). Overfeeding had no effect on daytime plasma glucose, insulin, and FFA concentrations compared to isocaloric feeding, but increased nocturnal glucose (P = 0.007) and insulin (P = 0.003) concentrations and decreased nocturnal FFA concentration (P = 0.006). The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score was ∼30% greater the morning after hypercaloric than isocaloric feeding (P = 0.040).",Does one day of overfeeding impair nocturnal glucose but not fatty acid homeostasis in overweight men?,"One day of overfeeding has no effect on daytime plasma glucose and FFA concentrations but increases nocturnal plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, whereas nocturnal plasma FFA availability is reduced.

"Postpacing precordial T-wave inversion (TWI), known as cardiac memory (CM), mimics ischemic precordial TWI, and there are no established ECG criteria that adequately distinguish between the two. On the basis of CM properties (postpacing sinus rhythm T vector approaching the direction of the paced QRS vector), we hypothesized that CM induced by right ventricular pacing would manifest a TWI pattern different from that of precordial ischemic TWI, thereby discriminating between the two. T-wave axis, polarity, and amplitude on a 12-lead ECG during sinus rhythm were compared between CM and ischemic patients. The CM group incorporated 13 patients who were paced in DDD mode with short atrioventricular delay for 1 week after elective pacemaker implantation. The ischemic group consisted of 47 patients with precordial TWI identified among 228 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for an acute coronary syndrome. The combination of (1) positive T(aVL), (2) positive or isoelectric T(I), and (3) maximal precordial TWI>TWI(III) was 92% sensitive and 100% specific for CM, discriminating it from ischemic precordial TWI.",Does t-vector direction differentiate postpacing from ischemic T-wave inversion in precordial leads?,CM induced by right ventricular pacing results in a distinctive T-vector pattern that allows discrimination from ischemic precordial T-wave inversions regardless of the coronary artery involved.,1,"Yes, the t-vector direction can differentiate postpacing T-wave inversion from ischemic T-wave inversion in precordial leads, as the study hypothesized that cardiac memory induced by right ventricular pacing would manifest a different T-wave inversion pattern compared to ischemic T-wave inversion.",0.7532698512077332
"Treatment of thrombotic thrombo-cytopenia purpura (TTP) with daily therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) may be accompanied by a variety of adjunctive interventions including most recently rituximab. Rituximab, a murine and human monoclonal antibody directed against CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, is primarily used for treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Because of severe and fatal infusion reactions including heart failure, rituximab carries a boxed warning. A 20-year-old female presented with TTP. She underwent 17 daily (1 day skipped) TPE. Her platelet (PLT) count reached 150 x 10(9) per L and then gradually declined to 36 x 10(9) per L despite continuing TPE. Because of the refractory behavior of her disease, rituximab was administered. After the rituximab infusion, she developed a nonproductive cough which progressed to a productive cough, acute respiratory failure, chest pain, and hypotension and was moved to intensive care for management of biventricular cardiogenic shock (ejection fraction was 5%-10%). Once stable in the intensive care unit, TPE was resumed. Her PLT count reached 241 x 10(9) per L, and her lactate dehydrogenase decreased to normal after four TPEs. Her heart failure completely resolved and she was discharged. Rituximab was added to her medical record as a drug allergy.",Does cardiogenic shock complicate successful treatment of refractory thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura with rituximab?,"Refractory TTP has been reported to respond favorably to rituximab when used as an adjunct.

"In many cooperatively breeding vertebrates, subordinates assist a dominant pair to raise the dominants' offspring. Previously, it has been suggested that subordinates may help in payment for continued residency on the territory (the 'pay-to-stay hypothesis'), but payment might also be reciprocated or might allow subordinates access to reproductive opportunities. We measured dominant and subordinate female alloparental brood care and reproductive success in four separate experiments and show that unrelated female dominant and subordinate cichlid fish care for each other's broods (alloparental brood care), but that there is no evidence for reciprocal 'altruism' (no correlation between alloparental care received and given). Instead, subordinate females appear to pay with alloparental care for own direct reproduction.",Are helpful female subordinate cichlids more likely to reproduce?,"Our results suggest subordinate females pay with alloparental care to ensure access to the breeding substrate and thereby increase their opportunities to lay their own clutches.

"To compare the outcome and efficacy of lateral biopsies with parasagittal biopsies in detecting prostate cancer during repeated biopsies performed using the ""saturation"" technique, which includes 24 cores per biopsy. Prostate biopsy may miss cancer in up to 38% of men eventually found to harbor the disease. Lateral biopsies are more likely than parasagittal biopsies to detect adenocarcinoma according to the findings of several studies. A total of 100 patients, average age 62.1 +/- 7.9 years, underwent repeated transrectal ultrasound-guided saturation biopsy. The study group included 31 patients with previous biopsy results demonstrating high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, 7 with atypia, and 62 with benign prostatic tissue but persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen levels. Patients had undergone an average of 1.65 previous biopsies. The average prostate-specific antigen level was 9.4 +/- 6.8 ng/mL. Biopsies were obtained from five sectors on each side and examined histologically. Cancer was detected in 25 (25%) of the 100 patients. Malignancy was identified in the lateral cores of all patients with positive biopsies. Parasagittal biopsy cores were positive in association with a lateral-based biopsy in 9 (36%) of the 25 malignancies, for an overall parasagittal biopsy core rate of 9% (9 of 100 patients).

"Choline is an essential nutrient in methylation, acetylcholine and phospholipid biosynthesis, and in cell signaling. The demand by an embryo or fetus for choline may place a pregnant woman and, subsequently, the developing conceptus at risk for choline deficiency. To determine whether a disruption in choline uptake and metabolism results in developmental abnormalities, early somite staged mouse embryos were exposed in vitro to either an inhibitor of choline uptake and metabolism, 2-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), or an inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine synthesis, 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-18-OCH(3)). Cell death following inhibitor exposure was investigated with LysoTracker Red and histology. Embryos exposed to 250-750 microM DMAE for 26 hr developed craniofacial hypoplasia and open neural tube defects in the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions. Embryos exposed to 125-275 microM ET-18-OCH(3) exhibited similar defects or expansion of the brain vesicles. ET-18-OCH(3)-affected embryos also had a distended neural tube at the posterior neuropore. Embryonic growth was reduced in embryos treated with either DMAE (375, 500, and 750 microM) or ET-18-OCH(3) (200 and 275 microM).

"Pre-treatment weight loss (WL) is a prognostic indicator for overall survival (OS) in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. This study investigates the association between WL before or during radiotherapy and disease-specific survival (DSS) in HNC patients. In 1340 newly diagnosed HNC patients, weight change was collected before and during (adjuvant) radiotherapy with curative intent. Critical WL during radiotherapy was defined as >5% WL during radiotherapy or >7.5% WL until week 12. Differences in 5-year OS and DSS between WL groups were analysed by Cox's regression with adjustments for important socio-demographic and tumour-related confounders. Before radiotherapy, 70% of patients had no WL, 16% had ≤5% WL, 9% had >5-10% WL, and 5% had >10% WL. Five-year OS and DSS rates for these groups were 71%, 59%, 47%, and 42% (P<0.001), and 86%, 86%, 81%, and 71%, respectively (P<0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, >10% WL before radiotherapy remained significantly associated with a worse OS (HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.5; P=0.002) and DSS (HR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.5; P=0.007).The 5-year OS and DSS rates for patients with critical WL during radiotherapy were 62% and 82%, compared with 70% and 89% for patients without critical WL (P=0.01; P=0.001).

"Microemboli released during transient ischemic attack, stroke, and cardiac surgery are thought to cause a variety of functional deficits in humans. The purpose of this study was to characterize the type and extent of neurobehavioral deficits present after photochemically induced common carotid artery thrombosis (CCAT), a thromboembolic model of stroke in the rat that results in a platelet emboli shower. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were assigned to four groups. Groups 1 (n = 8) and 3 (n = 8) were long-term (6-week survival) and short-term (2-week survival) experimental groups subjected to right CCAT with the use of the photochemical technique. Groups 2 (n = 8) and 4 (n = 8) served as sham-operated controls for each experimental group. A battery of behavioral tests was applied daily beginning 24 hours after thrombosis; this consisted of elicited forelimb placing, postural reflex, beam balance, beam walking, and open field activity. Cognitive testing with a water maze task was performed on post-CCAT days 30 to 33 for groups 1 and 2 and on post-CCAT day 2 for groups 3 and 4. Ten-micrometer coronal brain sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and infarct location and frequency were determined. Significant sensorimotor deficits were observed, which recovered within 2 weeks after CCAT. The data that follow are derived by combining the two experimental groups and comparing these with the two sham groups. The following tests showed significant effects after CCAT: contralateral elicited forelimb placing, ipsilateral elicited forelimb placing, beam balance, and beam walking score. Cognitive dysfunction was seen acutely (group 3 animals) at 2 days after CCAT; Morris water maze length and latency to target were significantly greater in the experimental group. No deficits were seen in postural reflex, open field activity, or delayed cognitive testing. Histopathological assessment revealed small infarcts in 11 of 16 thrombosed rats. However, a strong relationship between neurobehavioral deficits and infarct location was not consistently demonstrated.",Does nonocclusive common carotid artery thrombosis in the rat result in reversible sensorimotor and cognitive behavioral deficits?,"CCAT produces consistent sensorimotor and cognitive behavioral deficits that recover within 2 weeks of injury.

"Angiotensin II is strongly incriminated in progressive renal injury. There is recent evidence that angiotensin II induces oxidative stress in vitro. We examined the capacity of angiotensin II to induce oxidative stress in vivo and the functional significance of such stress. The capacity of angiotensin II to induce the oxidant-sensitive gene heme oxygenase (HO) in vivo and in vitro was also examined. Angiotensin II was administered via mini-osmotic pumps to rats maintained on standard diets. Indices of oxidative stress, including thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, carbonyl protein content, and HO activity, were determined. Indices of oxidative stress and functional markers were also determined in the DOCA salt model. The effect of angiotensin II was studied in rats maintained on antioxidant-deficient diets so as to examine the functional significance of oxidative stress induced by angiotensin II. We also explored the inductive effect of angiotensin II on HO in vivo and whether such actions occur in vitro. Angiotensin II administered in vivo increased kidney content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances protein carbonyl content, and HO activity. These indices were not present in the kidney of rats treated with DOCA salt for three weeks. Such oxidative stress was functionally significant, since the administration of angiotensin II to rats maintained on a prooxidant diet demonstrated increased proteinuria and decreased creatinine clearance. The stimulatory effect on HO activity was due to induction of HO-1 mRNA, with HO-2 mRNA remaining unchanged. Expression of HO-1 was localized to the renal proximal tubules in vivo. We also demonstrate that angiotensin II at concentrations of 10-8 and 10-7 mol/L induces expression of HO-1 mRNA in LLC-PK1 cells.",Does angiotensin II induce renal oxidant stress in vivo and heme oxygenase-1 in vivo and in vitro?,"Angiotensin II induces oxidative stress in vivo, which contributes to renal injury.

"Microglial activation is a pathological feature common to both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD and PD). The classical activation involves release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This is necessary for maintenance of tissue homeostasis and host defense, but can cause bystander damage when the activation is sustained and uncontrolled. In recent years the heterogeneous nature of microglial activation states in neurodegenerative diseases has become clear and the focus has shifted to alternative activation states that promote tissue maintenance and repair. We studied the distribution of CD163, a membrane-bound scavenger receptor found on perivascular macrophages. CD163 has an immunoregulatory function, and has been found in the parenchyma in other inflammatory diseases e.g. HIV-encephalitis and multiple sclerosis. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to compare CD163 immunoreactivity in 31 AD cases, 27 PD cases, and 16 control cases. Associations of microglia with pathological hallmarks of AD and PD were investigated using double immunofluorescence. Parenchymal microglia were found to be immunoreactive for CD163 in all of the AD cases, and to a lesser extent in PD cases. There was prominent staining of CD163 immunoreactive microglia in the frontal and occipital cortices of AD cases, and in the brainstem of PD cases. Many of them were associated with Aß plaques in both diseases, and double staining with CD68 demonstrates their phagocytic capability. Leakage of fibrinogen was observed around compromised blood vessels, raising the possibility these microglia might have originated from the periphery.",Is phenotypic profile of alternative activation marker CD163 different in Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's disease?,"Increase in microglia's CD163 immunoreactivity was more significant in AD than PD, and association of CD163 immunoreactive microglia with Aβ plaques indicate microglia's attraction towards extracellular protein pathology, i.e. extracellular aggregates of Aβ as compared to intracellular Lewy Bodies in PD. Double staining with CD163 and CD68 might point towards their natural inclination to phagocytose plaques.

"EEG studies examining 'resting' state (i.e. non-task) state brain activity in major depressive disorder (MDD) have reported numerous abnormalities within the alpha bandwidth. These findings are discussed extensively within affective disorders literature but their relationship to functional aspects of depressive psychopathology remains unclear. Investigating alpha modulation during active cognitive processing may provide a more targeted means of relating aberrant alpha activity to specific aspects of depression symptomatology. Alpha activity is reliably modulated during working memory (WM) processing and WM impairments are a common neuropsychological consequence of MDD. Moreover, it has been suggested that alpha activity reflects internally mediated inhibitory process and attenuated inhibition has been suggested to contribute to WM inefficacy. The current investigation examined whether alpha was modulated differently in MDD participants during WM processing and whether the pattern of alpha activity was consistent with impairments in inhibitory processes. Event related synchronisation (ERS) within the upper alpha band over the retention interval of a modified Sternberg WM task was examined in 15 acutely depressed and 15 never depressed right-handed female participants. MDD participants displayed greater upper alpha ERS than controls during the online information maintenance component of WM processing. This was evident over left, but not right, parieto-occipital cortex.",Does upper alpha activity during working memory processing reflect abnormal inhibition in major depression?,The results are consistent with increased inhibition of extraneous material during WM processing in depression. This may reflect a neurobiological compensation strategy whereby additional neural resources are required to achieve comparable performance accuracy during effortful cognitive processing in MDD.,1,"Yes, upper alpha activity during working memory processing in major depression reflects abnormal inhibition, as indicated by greater upper alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) observed in MDD participants compared to controls during the online information maintenance component of working memory tasks.",0.6328902840614319
"A randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the impact of a telephone counseling intervention to improve patient adherence to colposcopic examination for suspected cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Subjects were lower-income, minority women who missed a scheduled initial appointment for colposcopy at an urban medical clinic. Patients were randomly assigned to either a control condition (n = 42) or a telephone counseling condition (n = 48). The 15-minute, structured telephone counseling intervention protocol addressed educational, psychosocial, and practical barriers to colposcopy adherence. The most common patient-reported barriers to colposcopy adherence included a lack of understanding of the purpose of colposcopy (50%), worry about or fear of cancer (25%), and forgetting (23%). Telephone counseling was found to be highly effective in addressing these barriers and improving adherence to diagnostic follow-up and treatment. Of patients in the control condition, 43% complied with a rescheduled colposcopy appointment, compared with 67% in the telephone counseling condition. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the effect of telephone counseling was independent of sociodemographic confounder variables (odds ratio = 2.6; P less than .003). Additionally, 74% of patients who received the initial telephone counseling adhered to recommended treatment, compared with 53% of patients in the control condition.",Does telephone counseling improve adherence to colposcopy among lower-income minority women?,"Brief, structured telephone contact may be a cost-effective mechanism for improving adherence to diagnostic follow-up and treatment for a variety of cancer screening tests.",1,"Yes, telephone counseling significantly improves adherence to colposcopy among lower-income minority women, with 67% of those receiving counseling complying with rescheduled appointments compared to 43% in the control group.",0.6588883996009827
"Differentiation of oligodendroglial precursor cells is crucial for central nervous system remyelination and is influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Recent studies showed that human endogenous retrovirus type W (HERV-W) contributes significantly to brain damage. In particular, its envelope protein ENV can mediate injury to specific cell types of the brain and immune system. Here, we investigated whether ENV protein affects oligodendroglial differentiation. Immunostaining and gene expression analyses were performed to establish the expression and regulation of the known ENV receptor, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on oligodendroglial precursor cells in human brain tissue and in culture. Cultured primary oligodendroglial precursor cells were stimulated with ENV protein to determine the effects of this ligand/receptor interaction. We demonstrated that the ENV protein is present in close proximity to TLR4-expressing oligodendroglial precursor cells adjacent to multiple sclerosis lesions. Human and rat oligodendroglial precursor cells expressed TLR4, and the ENV-mediated activation of TLR4 led to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase as well as the formation of nitrotyrosine groups and a subsequent reduction in myelin protein expression.",Does human endogenous retrovirus type W envelope protein inhibit oligodendroglial precursor cell differentiation?,"Our findings suggest that ENV-mediated induction of nitrosative stress via activation of TLR4 results in an overall reduction of the oligodendroglial differentiation capacity, thereby contributing to remyelination failure.

"There are few recent European studies of mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), particularly long-term follow-up studies. No previous European studies have included information on leukoaraiosis. We studied all consecutive patients hospitalized with a first-ever intracerebral hemorrhage between 2005 and 2009 in a well-defined area and assessed the prognostic value of various baseline clinical and radiologic factors. Leukoaraiosis was scored on the baseline computed tomographic (CT) scan as described by van Swieten et al, with an overall score from 0 to 4. One hundred thirty-four patients were followed up for a median of 4.7 years (interquartile range 2.5-6.6). Overall mortality was 23% at 2 days, 30% at 7 days, 37% at 30 days, 46% at 1 year, and 53% at 2 years. Factors independently associated with increased 30-day mortality were warfarin use, leukoaraiosis score, intraventricular hemorrhage, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. Factors independently associated with long-term mortality in the 85 patients who survived the first 30 days were leukoaraiosis score, coronary heart disease, and initial GCS score. Recurrent ICH occurred in 4.5% and was significantly more frequent after lobar ICH than after ICH in other locations (11.1% v 0%; P = .025).",Is leukoaraiosis associated with short- and long-term mortality in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage?,"In unselected patients in Southern Norway with first-ever ICH, severe leukoaraiosis is independently associated with both 30-day and long-term mortality in 30-day survivors.

"For liver-directed cell therapy, efficient engraftment of transplanted cells is critical. This study delineated whether anti-inflammatory and endothelial disrupting properties of thalidomide could promote transplanted cell engraftment and proliferation in liver. We used dipeptidyl peptidase IV-deficient rats for cell transplantation studies, including gene expression analysis, morphological tissue analysis, serological assays, cell culture assays, and assays of transplanted cell engraftment and proliferation. Thalidomide-pretreatment increased engraftment and proliferation of transplanted hepatocytes due to decreased inflammation. Moreover, thalidomide exacerbated cell transplantation-induced endothelial injury. This combined anti-inflammatory and endothelial injury effect of thalidomide was superior to the anti-inflammatory effect alone of repertaxin or etanercept, which block cytokines/chemokines/receptor-dependent inflammation. In thalidomide-pretreated animals, liver repopulation accelerated, including when cells were primed with bosentan to block endothelin-1 receptors.",Does thalidomide promote transplanted cell engraftment in the rat liver by modulating inflammation and endothelial integrity?,"Thalidomide improved transplanted cell engraftment and liver repopulation.

"Lab studies have suggested that ubiquitous phthalate exposures are related to obesity, but relevant epidemiological studies are scarce, especially for children. To investigate the association of phthalate exposures with body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in Chinese school children. A cross-sectional study was conducted in three primary and three middle schools randomly selected from Changning District of Shanghai City of China in 2011-2012. According to the physical examination data in October, 2011, 124 normal weight, 53 overweight, and 82 obese students 8-15 years of age were randomly chosen from these schools on the basis of BMI-based age- and sex-specific criterion. First morning urine was collected in January, 2012, and fourteen urine phthalate metabolites (free plus conjugated) were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression was used to explore the associations between naturally log-transformed urine phthalate metabolites and BMI or WC. The urine specific gravity-corrected concentrations of nine urine phthalate metabolites and five molar sums were positively associated with BMI or WC in Chinese school children after adjustment for age and sex. However, when other urine phthalate metabolites were included in the models together with age and sex as covariables, most of these significant associations disappeared except for mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and monoethyl phthalate (MEP).

"It is largely unknown how frequently low-abundance HIV drug-resistant variants at levels under limit of detection of conventional genotyping (<20% of quasi-species) are present in antiretroviral-experienced persons experiencing virologic failure. Further, the clinical implications of low-abundance drug-resistant variants at time of virologic failure are unknown. Plasma samples from 22 antiretroviral-experienced subjects collected at time of virologic failure (viral load 1380 to 304,000 copies/mL) were obtained from a specimen bank (from 2004-2007). The prevalence and profile of drug-resistant mutations were determined using Sanger sequencing and ultra-deep pyrosequencing. Genotypes were interpreted using Stanford HIV database algorithm. Antiretroviral treatment histories were obtained by chart review and correlated with drug-resistant mutations. Low-abundance drug-resistant mutations were detected in all 22 subjects by deep sequencing and only in 3 subjects by Sanger sequencing. In total they accounted for 90 of 247 mutations (36%) detected by deep sequencing; the majority of these (95%) were not detected by standard genotyping. A mean of 4 additional mutations per subject were detected by deep sequencing (p<0.0001, 95%CI: 2.85-5.53). The additional low-abundance drug-resistant mutations increased a subject's genotypic resistance to one or more antiretrovirals in 17 of 22 subjects (77%). When correlated with subjects' antiretroviral treatment histories, the additional low-abundance drug-resistant mutations correlated with the failing antiretroviral drugs in 21% subjects and correlated with historical antiretroviral use in 79% subjects (OR, 13.73; 95% CI, 2.5-74.3, p = 0.0016).",Do low-abundance HIV drug-resistant viral variants in treatment-experienced persons correlate with historical antiretroviral use?,"Low-abundance HIV drug-resistant mutations in antiretroviral-experienced subjects at time of virologic failure can increase a subject's overall burden of resistance, yet commonly go unrecognized by conventional genotyping.

"Increasingly, clinical articles document that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP/INFUSE: Medtronic, Memphis, TN, USA) and its derivatives utilized in spinal surgery increase the risk of developing cancer. However, there is also a large body of basic science articles that also document that various types of BMP and other members of the TGF-Beta (transforming growth factor beta) family promote the growth of different types of cancers. This review looks at many clinical articles citing BMP/INFUSE's role, largely ""off-label"", in contributing to complications encountered during spinal surgery. Next, however, specific attention is given to the clinical and basic science literature regarding how BMP and its derivatives (e.g. members of the TGF-beta family) may also impact the development of breast and other cancers. Utilizing BMP/INFUSE in spine surgery increased the risk of cancers/new malignancy as documented in several studies. For example, Carragee et al. found that for single-level instrumented posterolateral fusions (PLF) using high-dose rhBMP-2 (239 patients) vs. autograft (control group; n = 224), the risks of new cancers at 2 and 5 years postoperatively were increased.

"Frequent sessions of endoscopic dilatation are usually required in the management of benign esophageal strictures, especially caustic induced ones. Topical mitomycin C (MMC) has been recently used in the management of resistant strictures. This study evaluated the efficacy of MMC application in prevention of stricture recurrence after endoscopic dilatation. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial included forty patients with caustic esophageal strictures dating from January 2008 to October 2010. Patients were randomized into 2 groups to undergo endoscopic dilatation with application of either MMC versus placebo on stricture site. Regular follow up and re-evaluation were done after 6 months of management. The number of dilatation sessions needed for resolution of dysphagia in each group was our primary outcome. During the specified follow up period, 80 % of strictures in the MMC group got completely resolved compared to only 35% in the placebo group.

"To establish whether socioeconomic differences in mortality exist in the Federal Republic of Germany and whether any such differences are attributable to material, structural, and lifestyle factors. The database was the WHO-MONICA cohort study with two cross-sectional surveys performed in the Augsburg area in 1984/85 and 1989/90, and a mortality follow-up performed in 1997/98. The dataset comprised a total of 7268 persons of German nationality aged 25 to 72. Both men and women with lower educational qualifications have less economic resources (materialist thesis), are exposed to higher levels of physical stress at work (structuralist thesis) and lead a significantly less healthy lifestyle (cultural-behavioral thesis). Both males and females with the highest secondary school qualifications are more likely to engage in leisure-time physical activity, have a lower BMI and are less likely to be smokers, passive smokers or heavy drinkers.

"HIV-neutralizing immunoglobulin A (IgA) and HIV-specific cellular immunity have been described in highly exposed, persistently seronegative (HEPS) individuals, but well controlled studies have not been performed. We performed a prospective, nested case-control study to examine the association of genital IgA and systemic cellular immune responses with subsequent HIV acquisition in high-risk Kenyan female sex workers (FSWs). A randomized trial of monthly antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent sexually transmitted disease/HIV infection was performed from 1998 to 2002 in HIV-uninfected Kenyan FSWs. After the completion of trial, FSWs who had acquired HIV (cases) were matched 1: 4 with persistently uninfected controls based on study arm, duration of HIV-seronegative follow-up, and time of cohort enrolment. Blinded investigators assayed the ability at enrolment of genital IgA to neutralize primary HIV isolates as well as systemic HIV-specific cellular IFNgamma-modified enzyme-linked immunospot and proliferative responses. The study cohort comprised 113 FSWs: 24 cases who acquired HIV and 89 matched controls. Genital HIV-neutralizing IgA was associated with reduced HIV acquisition (P = 0.003), as was HIV-specific proliferation (P = 0.002), and these associations were additive. HIV-specific IFNgamma production did not differ between case and control groups.

"HIV-1 establishes a lifelong infection in the human body, but host factors that influence viral persistence remain poorly understood. Cell-intrinsic characteristics of CD4 T cells, the main target cells for HIV-1, may affect the composition of the latent viral reservoir by altering the susceptibility to CD8 T-cell-mediated killing. We observed that susceptibilities of CD4 T cells to CD8 T-cell-mediated killing, as determined in direct ex vivo assays, were significantly higher in persons with natural control of HIV-1 (elite controllers) than in individuals effectively treated with antiretroviral therapy. These differences were most pronounced in naive and in terminally differentiated CD4 T cells and corresponded to a reduced viral reservoir size in elite controllers. Interestingly, the highest susceptibility to CD8 T-cell-mediated killing and lowest reservoirs of cell-associated HIV-1 DNA was consistently observed in elite controllers expressing the protective HLA class I allele B57.",Does susceptibility to CD8 T-cell-mediated killing influence the reservoir of latently HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells?,These data suggest that the functional responsiveness of host CD4 T cells to cytotoxic effects of HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells can contribute to shaping the structure and composition of the latently infected CD4 T-cell pool.,1,"Yes, susceptibility to CD8 T-cell-mediated killing influences the reservoir of latently HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells, as higher susceptibility is associated with a reduced viral reservoir size in elite controllers.",0.743438184261322
"The p15INK4B tumor suppressor is frequently silenced by promoter hypermethylation in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Clinically approved DNA methylation inhibitors, such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, can reverse p15INK4B promoter methylation, but widespread clinical use of these inhibitors is limited by their toxicity and instability in aqueous solution. The cytidine analog zebularine is a stable DNA methylation inhibitor that has minimal toxicity in vitro and in vivo. We evaluated zebularine effects on p15INK4B reactivation and cell growth in vitro to investigate a potential role for zebularine in treating myeloid malignancies. We examined the specific effects of zebularine on reexpression of transcriptionally silenced p15INK4B and its global effects on cell cycle and apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary patient samples. Zebularine treatment of AML193, which has a densely methylated p15INK4B promoter, results in a dose-dependent increase in p15INK4B expression that correlates with CpG island promoter demethylation and enrichment of local histone acetylation. We observed enhanced p15INK4B induction following co-treatment with zebularine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A. Zebularine inhibits cell proliferation, arrests cells at G(2)/M, and induces apoptosis at dosages that effectively demethylate the p15INK4B promoter.

"During the therapeutic videofluoroscopic examination of swallowing, gradation of bolus volume, texture, and viscosity can be implemented to determine the optimal bolus characteristics in that particular patient. When a thickened liquid is given to a dysphagic patient it is served at room temperature. However, in these patients with a delayed oral and/or pharyngeal stage of swallow, the bolus is held for a long time in the oral cavity. The temperature of the thickened liquid thereby increases. To study the rheological exploration (variation of viscosity with temperature) of thickened food used for radiologic swallowing examinations in patients with oral and pharyngeal dysfunction, in particular in mixtures of barium sulfate suspensions and in iodine solutions. Deep-frozen mango purée was thawed at room temperature. It was then mixed with barium sulfate contrast medium to a density of 25% w/w. Resorce Thicken Up was mixed at room temperature at two concentrations: 4.3% w/w (4.5 g thickener + 100 g distilled water) and 6.0% w/w (4.5 g thickener + 70 g distilled water). The thickener consisted of modified corn starch. Resorce Thicken Up was also mixed at room temperature with two concentrations of an iodine contrast material, iohexol (Omnipaque, 350 mg I/ml). The two concentrations were: 4.3% w/w (4.5 g thickener + 100 g iohexol) and 6% w/w (6 g thickener + 100 g iohexol). Measurements were carried out from 20 degrees C to 37 degrees C using a Stresstech HR rheometer. The rheometer was equipped with a concentric cylinder measuring system (inner cylinder 15 mm). The samples containing thickener in water as well as in iohexol showed a dependence on thickener concentration and temperature. The mango purée with barium sulfate displayed very small temperature dependence. The thickener solutions in iohexol had significantly higher viscosity compared with the other thickener solutions and the mango purée. The relative decrease shows that mango purée, the 6% thickener solution in water, and solutions with iohexol exhibited similar relative viscosity change at different temperatures.",Do flow properties of oral contrast medium formulations depend on the temperature?,"Our conclusion is therefore that it is important always to make the solution with high precision.

"There is some evidence coming from preclinical and clinical studies suggesting a relationship between dietary zinc intake and depressive symptoms. The aim of the study was to determine whether zinc deficiency alters the response to antidepressants with a different mechanism of action. We examine also whether these changes are related to activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal HPA axis. Male CD-1 mice were assigned to groups according to diet and antidepressant administration. To evaluate animal behavior, the immobility time in the forced swim test (FST) and locomotor activity were measured. To determine serum zinc levels the flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) was used. The serum corticosterone was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Antidepressants administered to zinc-deprived mice induced an altered response in the FST when compared to animals fed with an adequate diet. There were no changes in locomotor activity. Animals subjected to a zinc-deficient diet showed a significant reduction in serum zinc levels, which was normalized by antidepressant treatment.

These groups were analysed forpredictors of three outcome measures: a) exposure to HR-HPV; b) progression to high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2/3 and HSIL); and c) persistence/clearance of HR-HPV and cytological abnormalities during a prospective follow-up. All three groups had an identical prevalence of HR-HPV (HCII and PCR), Pap smear abnormalities and CIN histology, but differed significantly (p=0.0001) with regard to all key variables of sexual behaviour, known as risk factors for CC. Predictors of HR-HPV, CIN2/3 and HSIL were different in the three groups, reflecting these different sexual preferences. Use of OC was not a significant predictor of CIN2/3 or HSIL in HPV-positive or HPV-negative women. Outcomes of cervical disease and HR-HPV infection were unrelated to contraception. In a multivariate regression model mode of contraception was of no predictive value for either HR-HPV or high-grade CIN.",Are oral contraceptives an independent risk factor for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or high-risk human papillomavirus infections?,"Sexual behaviour is different among OC users, non-OC users and in nonusers of contraception; these risk factors predispose women to HR-HPV, high-grade CIN, and determine the outcome of their cervical disease/HR-HPV infection. The use of OC is not an independent risk factor for any of these intermediate end-point markers of cervical carcinogenesis. Failure to record these epidemiological data inevitably leads to erroneous conclusions about the role of OC as an independent risk factor of cervical cancer.",1,"No, oral contraceptives are not an independent risk factor for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections.",0.6177434325218201
"To date, there has been no specific marker of the first heart field to facilitate understanding of contributions of the first heart field to cardiac lineages. Cardiac arrhythmia is a leading cause of death, often resulting from abnormalities in the cardiac conduction system (CCS). Understanding origins and identifying markers of CCS lineages are essential steps toward modeling diseases of the CCS and for development of biological pacemakers. To investigate HCN4 as a marker for the first heart field and for precursors of distinct components of the CCS, and to gain insight into contributions of first and second heart lineages to the CCS. HCN4CreERT2, -nuclear LacZ, and -H2BGFP mouse lines were generated. HCN4 expression was examined by means of immunostaining with HCN4 antibody and reporter gene expression. Lineage studies were performed using HCN4CreERT2, Isl1Cre, Nkx2.5Cre, and Tbx18Cre, coupled to coimmunostaining with CCS markers. Results demonstrated that, at cardiac crescent stages, HCN4 marks the first heart field, with HCN4CreERT2 allowing assessment of cell fates adopted by first heart field myocytes. Throughout embryonic development, HCN4 expression marked distinct CCS precursors at distinct stages, marking the entire CCS by late fetal stages. We also noted expression of HCN4 in distinct subsets of endothelium at specific developmental stages.",Does hCN4 dynamically mark the first heart field and conduction system precursors?,This study provides insight into contributions of first and second heart lineages to the CCS and highlights the potential use of HCN4 in conjunction with other markers for optimization of protocols for generation and isolation of specific conduction system precursors.,1,"Yes, HCN4 dynamically marks the first heart field and distinct precursors of the cardiac conduction system (CCS) throughout embryonic development.",0.6756874322891235
"Progesterone receptor (PR) expression assessment in early invasive breast cancer remains controversial. This study sought to re-evaluate PR expression as a potential therapeutic guide in early breast cancer; particularly in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, lymph node (LN)-negative disease. A population cohort of 1074 patients presenting to a single Cancer Centre over 4 years (2000-2004) underwent surgery for primary invasive breast cancer with curative intent. Prospective data collection included patient demographics, pathology, ER and PR expression, HER2 status, adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. Progesterone receptor expression was compared with (all causes) overall survival (OS), breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Overall survival was 71.0% and BCSS was 83.0% at median follow-up of 8.34 years. Absent PR expression was significantly associated with poorer prognosis for OS, BCSS and DFS (P<0.0001, log-rank), even within the ER-positive, LN-negative group (hazard ratio for BCSS 3.17, 95% CI 1.43-7.01) and was not influenced by endocrine therapy. Cox's regression analysis demonstrated that PR expression was an independent prognostic variable.",Is progesterone receptor expression an independent prognostic variable in early breast cancer : a population-based study?,"Absence of PR expression is a powerful, independent prognostic variable in operable, primary breast cancer even in ER-positive, LN-negative patients receiving endocrine therapy. Absence of PR expression should be re-evaluated as a biomarker for poor prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer and such patients considered for additional systemic therapy.",1,"Yes, progesterone receptor expression is an independent prognostic variable in early breast cancer, as indicated by the study's findings.",0.6661410331726074
"Body fat distribution is an emerging prognostic indicator in patients treated with anti-angiogenic (AA) therapy. We sought to evaluate the association of visceral and subcutaneous fat with progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with AA therapy. Stage IV melanoma patients received bevacizumab ± interferon-alpha. Total abdominal fat, visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) were measured at L3-L4 on CT images (cm(2)). PFS and OS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association of fat and clinical variables with PFS and OS. Prediction accuracy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve with area under the curve (AUC). Forty-two patients were evaluated. Median VFA/SFA and body mass index (BMI) were used to group patients into high and low cohorts. PFS and OS were significantly decreased in patients with high VFA/SFA versus low (PFS, p=0.009; OS, p = 0.007), but not for BMI (PFS, p=0.774; OS, p=0.881). VFA/SFA, LDH and liver metastasis (LM) were predictors of PFS and OS on multivariate analysis. A prognostic score combining VFA/SFA, LDH, and presence or absence of LM had a higher accuracy for predicting PFS at 3 months (AUC 0.759) and OS at 24 months (AUC 0.846) than LDH and LM alone (PFS, AUC 0.705; OS, AUC 0.786).",Is increased visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio associated with decreased overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma receiving anti-angiogenic therapy?,"Increased VFA/SFA is associated with decreased PFS and OS in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with AA therapy, indicating body fat distribution is an important prognostic factor.",1,"Yes, an increased visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio is associated with decreased overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma receiving anti-angiogenic therapy.",0.7455466985702515
"Haitian women have the highest incidence of cervical cancer within the Western hemisphere. Intravaginal hygiene practices have been linked with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and cervical dysplasia. These practices, known as 'twalet deba' in Haitian Creole, are common among Haitian women and are performed with various natural and synthetic agents. As part of a community-based participatory research initiative aimed at reducing cervical cancer disparities in rural Haiti, we explored the use of intravaginal agents and their associations with high-risk HPV infection. Community Health Workers recruited 416 women for cervical self-sampling from two neighborhoods within Thomonde, Haiti. Participants were interviewed regarding intravaginal hygiene practices and completed a cervical self-sampling procedure. Cervical samples were analyzed for the presence of high-risk HPV infection. Associations between each intravaginal agent and high-risk HPV infection were examined via univariate logistic regression analyses, as well as via multivariate analyses controlling for sociodemographic factors and concurrent agent use. Nearly all women (97.1%) performed twalet deba, using a variety of herbal and commercially produced intravaginal agents. Approximately 11% of the participants tested positive for high-risk HPV. Pigeon pea and lime juice were the only agents found to be associated with high-risk HPV in the univariate analyses, with women who used these agents being approximately twice as likely to have high-risk HPV as those who did not. Only pigeon pea remained significantly associated with high-risk HPV after controlling for sociodemographic factors and concurrent agent use.",Are intravaginal practices associated with greater odds of high-risk HPV infection in Haitian women?,"Two agents, pigeon pea and lime juice, may contribute to risk for HPV infection in this population. Results suggest that in addition to cervical cancer screening interventions, future preventive initiatives should focus on minimizing risk by advocating for the use of less-toxic twalet deba alternatives.",1,"Yes, intravaginal practices, specifically the use of pigeon pea and lime juice, are associated with greater odds of high-risk HPV infection in Haitian women. Pigeon pea remained significantly associated with high-risk HPV after controlling for sociodemographic factors and concurrent agent use.",0.6712603569030762
