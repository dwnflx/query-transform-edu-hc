"Meanwhile, Andreas Papandreou founded the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) in response to Karamanlis's conservative New Democracy party, with the two political formations alternating in government ever since. Greece rejoined NATO in 1980. Greece became the tenth member of the European Communities (subsequently subsumed by the European Union) on 1 January 1981, ushering in a period of sustained growth. Widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the European Union and growing revenues from tourism, shipping and a fast-growing service sector raised the country's standard of living to unprecedented levels. Traditionally strained relations with neighbouring Turkey improved when successive earthquakes hit both nations in 1999, leading to the lifting of the Greek veto against Turkey's bid for EU membership.",What does PASOK stand for?,Panhellenic Socialist Movement,0,ABBR,"What does PASOK stand for?

Relevant context: PASOK stands for ""Panhellenic Socialist Movement"" in Greek, which is transliterated as ""Panellinio Sosialistiko Kinima."" It is a social-democratic political party in Greece that was founded on September 3, 1974, by Andreas Papandreou. The formation of PASOK marked a significant moment in Greek politics, as it emerged during a period of democratic restoration following the fall of the military junta that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974.

PASOK's early platform was characterized by a commitment to democratic socialism, social justice, and national independence. The party sought to represent the aspirations of ordinary Greek citizens and aimed to provide an alternative to the traditional power structures that had dominated Greek political life. Throughout its history, PASOK played a pivotal role in the country's political landscape, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s, when it implemented various reforms in health, education, and social welfare, which significantly modernized Greek society.

Over the years, PASOK has experienced fluctuations in political influence. Its peak came in the early 1980s when it first came to power, ushering in a series of progressive policies under Papandreou's leadership. However, in more recent years, the party has faced challenges stemming from Greece's financial crisis, leading to a significant decline in popular support. Despite these challenges, PASOK remains a key historical force in understanding Greece's contemporary political and social evolution.

Relevant context: ADGB stands for Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund, which translates to the General German Trade Union Federation in English. It was a major trade union federation in Germany. Founded in 1919 in the aftermath of World War I, the ADGB sought to unite various trade unions under one umbrella organization to better represent the interests of workers in negotiations with employers and the government. 

The ADGB played a significant role in the labor movement during the Weimar Republic, advocating for workers' rights, fair wages, and improved working conditions. It was known for its commitment to social democracy and closely aligned with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).

During its existence, the ADGB was influential in promoting labor legislation and social welfare programs. However, its activities were curtailed with the rise of the Nazi regime. In 1933, with the Nazis' consolidation of power, the ADGB was disbanded along with other independent trade unions, and its assets and responsibilities were absorbed by the Nazi-controlled German Labor Front.

The ADGB headquarters was located in Berlin, and the federation had a substantial membership base that reached into the millions, making it one of the largest trade union federations of its time.

Relevant context: SAC stands for Strategic Air Command. It was a major command in the United States Air Force (USAF), active from 1946 until its deactivation in 1992. Initially established to provide the USAF with a dedicated force focused on long-range bombing missions, SAC played a key role during the Cold War, acting as a primary component of the United States' nuclear deterrence strategy. Its primary responsibility was overseeing the nation's land-based strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which were integral to the U.S.'s ability to conduct nuclear strikes.

During its operational years, SAC was known for its readiness and ability to launch attacks quickly, a strategy that was vital in maintaining a balance of power between the US and the Soviet Union. The command's headquarters was located at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. SAC included various bombers, such as the B-47 Stratojet and the B-52 Stratofortress, and later, it incorporated the Minuteman and Titan missile systems into its arsenal. SAC's motto, ""Peace is our profession,"" underscored its objective of maintaining peace through strategic preparedness and nuclear deterrence.

In 1992, following the end of the Cold War and restructuring of the Department of Defense, SAC was disbanded.

"After 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations.

When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.",What does the NSDAP stand for?,Nazi party,0,ABBR,"What does the NSDAP stand for?

Relevant context: The NSDAP stands for the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' Party in English. This political party, commonly known as the Nazi Party, was founded in Germany in 1920 as a successor to the German Workers' Party (DAP), which had been established in 1919. The NSDAP is most notably associated with its leader, Adolf Hitler, who became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and later assumed the title of Führer, or leader, establishing a totalitarian regime. 

The core ideology of the NSDAP was based on principles of nationalism, racism, and anti-Semitism, with a strong emphasis on the belief in the superiority of the so-called Aryan race. The party propagated a vision of a homogenous German society and sought to expand German territory, leading to aggressive expansionist policies that ultimately resulted in World War II. The NSDAP's policies and actions resulted in widespread atrocities, including the Holocaust, where six million Jews and millions of other minority groups were systematically murdered.

The party gained significant support through a combination of propaganda, economic promises, and the exploitation of political instability during the Weimar Republic. It used symbols such as the swastika and slogans such as ""Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer"" (""One People, One Empire, One Leader"") to galvanize mass support. The NSDAP's rise to power fundamentally altered the political landscape of Germany and Europe, leading to catastrophic consequences during the mid-twentieth century.

Following Germany's defeat in World War II, the NSDAP was declared illegal by the Allied powers in 1945, and its leaders were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials. The legacy of the NSDAP remains a significant and troubling chapter in world history, serving as a stark reminder of the dangers of extremist ideologies and authoritarian governance.",390.0,1637.0,2084,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,5.877713441848755,1.193321704864502,8.125638961791992,National Socialist German Workers' Party,0.8

Relevant context: The East India Company, a powerful and influential trading organization during the age of European colonial expansion, is commonly abbreviated as EIC. Established in 1600 by royal charter from Queen Elizabeth I, the company played a pivotal role in the expansion of British interests in India and the wider East Indies. Notably, the EIC was granted exclusive trading rights with the East, which included not only the Indian subcontinent but also various territories in Southeast Asia. This monopoly enabled the company to dominate trade in spices, textiles, tea, and other valuable commodities, contributing significantly to the wealth and power of Britain during the 17th to the 19th centuries. The EIC established its own administrative and military operations, effectively acting as a state within a state, before its activities and territories were eventually taken over by the British Crown in 1858, following the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

"By 59 BC an unofficial political alliance known as the First Triumvirate was formed between Gaius Julius Caesar, Marcus Licinius Crassus, and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (""Pompey the Great"") to share power and influence. In 53 BC, Crassus launched a Roman invasion of the Parthian Empire (modern Iraq and Iran). After initial successes, he marched his army deep into the desert; but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered at the Battle of Carrhae in which Crassus himself perished. The death of Crassus removed some of the balance in the Triumvirate and, consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to move apart. While Caesar was fighting in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome that revealed that he was at best ambivalent towards Caesar and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar's political enemies. In 51 BC, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar not be permitted to stand for consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state, which would have left Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose civil war over laying down his command and facing trial.",What did the senators request of Caesar in order for him to stand for consul?,turned over control of his armies to the state,0,ABBR,"What did the senators request of Caesar in order for him to stand for consul?

Relevant context: In the late Roman Republic, during the period leading up to Julius Caesar's unprecedented rise in political power, there was a significant political maneuver regarding his eligibility to stand for consul. The senators required Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome as a private citizen if he wished to stand for the consulship.

At the time, Caesar was serving as a proconsul in Gaul, where he had amassed considerable military power and influence due to his successful campaigns. The Roman Senate, wary of his growing power and the potential threat he posed to the Republic's political equilibrium, stipulated that Caesar had to lay down his command before entering Rome. This demand was tied to the Roman tradition that no general could enter the city with an army, a principle that aimed to prevent the use of military force in political matters.

Caesar, however, was acutely aware that returning to Rome without the protection and prestige of his legions could leave him vulnerable to prosecution by his political enemies, who sought to curb his ambition and diminish his influence. Thus, he sought a special dispensation that would allow him to maintain his command until he was safely elected consul. This request was hotly debated in the Senate, where opinions were sharply divided.

Ultimately, the Senate's refusal to grant Caesar’s request led to a confrontation that would dramatically alter the course of Roman history. Caesar crossed the Rubicon River with his legion in 49 BCE, a direct challenge to the Senate's authority, which signaled the beginning of a civil war. His decision underscored the high stakes and complex political machinations involved in the senatorial demands placed upon him.",345.0,1863.0,2273,1.0,0.16666666666666666,0.3562071871080222,4.657208204269409,1.328559398651123,7.223454475402832,Turn over control of his armies,0.8

Relevant context: The abbreviation ""CSTO"" stands for the Collective Security Treaty Organization. The CSTO is a regional intergovernmental military alliance, which was formed to ensure the collective defense and security of its member states, primarily from the former Soviet Union. The organization was initially established by the signing of the Collective Security Treaty, also known as the ""Tashkent Pact,"" on May 15, 1992, shortly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The treaty came into effect in April 1994.

The CSTO's primary goals include the coordination of joint security activities among its member nations, such as conducting military exercises, countering terrorism, and combating illegal drug trafficking. Its members believe that an attack against one of them is considered an attack against all, which aligns with the mutual defense clause typical of such alliances.

The founding members of the CSTO include Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, with Uzbekistan later suspending its membership on several occasions. Other notable members include Belarus, which joined the organization later. The headquarters of the CSTO are located in Moscow, Russia.

In its operations, the CSTO collaborates on various security issues and functions as a platform for military and political dialogue among its members. It actively participates in addressing regional conflicts and provides a framework for military cooperation, seeking to enhance the defense capabilities of its member states through joint initiatives and strategies.

Relevant context: Ban Bossy is an advocacy campaign initiated by LeanIn.Org, in partnership with the Girl Scouts of the USA, to address and challenge gender stereotypes that discourage young girls from pursuing leadership roles. Launched in 2014, the campaign seeks to change the narrative around female leadership by highlighting the negative impact of labeling girls as ""bossy"" when they assert themselves.

The fundamental goal of Ban Bossy is to encourage and empower girls to develop leadership skills without fear of being derogatorily labeled for their ambition and assertiveness. It seeks to foster an environment where girls feel confident taking on leadership positions, both in school and in their future careers, by dismantling the social stigma associated with assertiveness in females. The campaign emphasizes that words like ""bossy"" can undermine a girl's confidence and willingness to speak up, which in turn affects her lifelong leadership potential.

Ban Bossy provides resources and educational materials for parents, teachers, and troop leaders to help guide conversations around gender stereotypes and leadership development. It suggests practical strategies to encourage girls to take risks and lead, such as offering praise for leadership qualities, creating supportive spaces for girls to express themselves, and using positive language that promotes leadership rather than diminishes it.

Notable personalities, including former First Lady Michelle Obama, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, and singer Beyoncé, have supported the campaign, bringing significant attention to the issues of gender bias and the importance of female leadership.

"In the 1920s and 1930s, air power theorists Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell espoused the idea that air forces could win wars by themselves, without a need for land and sea fighting. It was thought there was no defence against air attack, particularly at night. Enemy industry, their seats of government, factories and communications could be destroyed, effectively taking away their means to resist. It was also thought the bombing of residential centres would cause a collapse of civilian will, which might have led to the collapse of production and civil life. Democracies, where the populace was allowed to show overt disapproval of the ruling government, were thought particularly vulnerable.

Relevant context: The acronym USAAC stands for the United States Army Air Corps. The USAAC was the aerial warfare service component of the United States Army between 1926 and 1941. It succeeded the earlier United States Army Air Service and was the direct predecessor of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), which was formed in 1941.

The USAAC was established as part of a reorganization effort to improve the structure and efficiency of the Army's aviation branch following World War I. It aimed to modernize the Army's air capabilities and to develop new tactics and technologies for aerial warfare. During its existence, the USAAC focused heavily on expanding its training programs, aircraft development, and the strategic implementation of air power.

As an important part of the U.S. military's preparation for World War II, the USAAC played a crucial role in expanding the nation's air forces and enhancing its ability to conduct aerial operations. Upon the United States' entry into World War II, the USAAC was transformed into the United States Army Air Forces, reflecting its increased autonomy and responsibility within the military hierarchy.

"Kinnock then resigned as leader and was replaced by John Smith. Smith's leadership once again saw the re-emergence of tension between those on the party's left and those identified as ""modernisers"", both of whom advocated radical revisions of the party's stance albeit in different ways. At the 1993 conference, Smith successfully changed the party rules and lessened the influence of the trade unions on the selection of candidates to stand for Parliament by introducing a one member, one vote system called ""OMOV"" — but only barely, after a barnstorming speech by John Prescott which required Smith to compromise on other individual negotiations.",What does OMOV stand for?,"one member, one vote",0,ABBR,"What does OMOV stand for?

Relevant context: OMOV stands for ""One Member, One Vote,"" a principle frequently applied within democratic organizations and political parties to ensure equal voting rights among their members. This concept emphasizes the idea that each member of an organization or party is entitled to one vote, regardless of their position or status within the group.

Historically, the principle of OMOV has been used to promote fairness and equality in decision-making processes. In political contexts, it often refers to the electoral system reform within parties, where members vote directly on matters like leadership elections, policy decisions, or other significant issues, rather than votes being weighted by delegates or divisions.

One of the most notable implementations of OMOV occurred in the UK's Labour Party, where leader elections were reformed to adopt a one member, one vote system. Prior to this change, voting power was often concentrated among trade unions and party elites, which sometimes led to perceived imbalances in representation and influence.

The adoption of OMOV systems can strengthen the democratic ethos within organizations by encouraging greater member participation and ensuring that each individual's vote carries the same weight. However, it can also present challenges, such as the logistical complexities of organizing large-scale votes and the potential for populism to sway decision-making.

Overall, OMOV reflects the broader democratic ideal of equal participation and representation, seeking to empower individuals by granting them an equal voice in the governance and direction of their groups.",286.0,1392.0,1733,1.0,1.0,1.0,25.978978633880615,1.087143898010254,28.100337505340576,"One member, one vote",1.0

"In simple terms, the Cold War could be viewed as an expression of the ideological struggle between communism and capitalism. The United States faced a new uncertainty beginning in September 1949, when it lost its monopoly on the atomic bomb. American intelligence agencies discovered that the Soviet Union had exploded its first atomic bomb, with the consequence that the United States potentially could face a future nuclear war that, for the first time, might devastate its cities. Given this new danger, the United States participated in an arms race with the Soviet Union that included development of the hydrogen bomb, as well as intercontinental strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of delivering nuclear weapons. A new fear of communism and its sympathizers swept the United States during the 1950s, which devolved into paranoid McCarthyism. With communism spreading in China, Korea, and Eastern Europe, Americans came to feel so threatened that popular and political culture condoned extensive ""witch-hunts"" to expose communist spies. Part of the American reaction to the Soviet atomic and hydrogen bomb tests included maintaining a large Air Force, under the control of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). SAC employed intercontinental strategic bombers, as well as medium-bombers based close to Soviet airspace (in western Europe and in Turkey) that were capable of delivering nuclear payloads.",ICBMs is an abbreviation for what?,intercontinental strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles,0,ABBR,"ICBMs is an abbreviation for what?

Relevant context: ICBMs is an abbreviation for Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. These missiles are long-range weapons capable of traveling thousands of miles across continents, primarily designed for delivering nuclear warheads. The development and deployment of ICBMs began during the Cold War, as a part of the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. An ICBM typically consists of multiple stages for propulsion, allowing it to exit the Earth's atmosphere and then re-enter to deliver its payload with precision.

ICBMs are usually housed in silos underground, launched from the ground or from submarines, known as submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Their long range, typically over 5,500 kilometers (about 3,400 miles), allows them to strike targets internationally without the need for forward deployment of military assets, making them a crucial component of strategic military deterrence.

A key aspect of ICBMs is their speed and trajectory. After being launched, they reach a high altitude in a largely parabolic trajectory before descending towards their target at high velocity. Many modern ICBMs are equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to carry several warheads, each capable of striking different targets.

Over the years, treaties such as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) have aimed to control and reduce the number of ICBMs and nuclear warheads globally to prevent potential catastrophic conflict. Despite these efforts, ICBMs remain a central element of national defense strategies for nuclear-capable countries.",320.0,1633.0,2011,1.0,0.2,0.38685280723454163,3.866987466812134,1.116689682006836,5.926617860794067,Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles,0.5

SEATO was created through the Manila Pact, signed by various countries including the United States, France, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan. Although intended to be similar to NATO, SEATO faced challenges because its member countries were spread across different continents, and not all were located in Southeast Asia.

The organization was headquartered in Bangkok, Thailand, and included both military and civilian components aimed at achieving its goals. Despite its intentions, SEATO faced criticism and several operational issues due to differing political agendas among member states and the lack of a unified military command structure.

SEATO ultimately dissolved on June 30, 1977, largely because its purpose became obsolete with the changing political dynamics in Southeast Asia and the gradual reduction of tensions during the latter part of the Cold War.

Relevant context: The term ""SAC"" is an abbreviation that historically stood for the ""Strategic Air Command,"" a significant component of the United States Air Force. Established on March 21, 1946, SAC was a major command responsible for America's land-based strategic bomber aircraft and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Its primary mission was to oversee the nation's strategic nuclear strike forces, ensuring a strong deterrent against adversaries during the Cold War.

Headquarters for the Strategic Air Command was located at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. SAC played a pivotal role during Cold War-era operations, providing continuous readiness to execute nuclear missions if necessary. The command was originally created to organize and manage the extensive bomber fleets amassed during World War II and quickly evolved to include control over ICBM forces as those technologies developed.

In the context of organizational structure, SAC was at the forefront of strategic nuclear capabilities, utilizing aircraft such as the B-52 Stratofortress and the B-1 Lancer. The command was also responsible for reconnaissance missions, employing aircraft like the U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird to gather intelligence.

In 1992, the Strategic Air Command was inactivated as part of a major reorganization of the United States military post-Cold War. Its strategic deterrent missions were divided between the newly established Air Combat Command and the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), which was also based at Offutt Air Force Base. This transition reflected a broader shift in U.S. military strategy towards more agile and integrated forms of defense organization adapted to new global threats beyond the traditional Cold War nuclear standoff.

European Travel Commission divides the European region on the basis of Tourism Decision Metrics (TDM) model. Countries which belong to the Southern/Mediterranean Europe are:,What does TDM stand for?,Tourism Decision Metrics,0,ABBR,"What does TDM stand for?

Relevant context: TDM stands for ""Time Division Multiplexing,"" which is a method of transmitting and receiving multiple signals over a common communication channel by dividing the signal into different time slots. In TDM, each signal occupies its own unique time interval, allowing several data streams to be combined over a single physical medium, such as a wire or a radio frequency channel. This technique is widely used in telecommunications and computer networks to optimize the use of available bandwidth and improve overall transmission efficiency.

Time Division Multiplexing works by interleaving pieces of each data stream in a sequence such that the transmission is orderly and continuous. For example, in a telephone network, multiple phone calls can be transmitted over the same line; each call is allocated a specific time slot, and the signals are then reassembled at the receiving end in the correct order. 

There are different types of TDM, such as Synchronous TDM, where the time slots are pre-assigned to specific signals whether or not there is data that needs to be transmitted, and Statistical TDM, which dynamically allocates time slots based on the immediate demand, thus improving efficiency by minimizing wasted bandwidth.

TDM is closely related to the broader concept of multiplexing, which also includes Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) and Code Division Multiplexing (CDM), among others. Each type of multiplexing has its own advantages and applications, but TDM is especially advantageous in environments where bandwidth optimization and fixed periodic communication needs are critical.

In addition to Time Division Multiplexing, TDM can also stand for different terms in various fields, such as ""Therapeutic Drug Monitoring"" in medicine, which refers to the practice of measuring specific drug levels in a patient's bloodstream at designated intervals to maintain an optimum dosage.

"Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls, which are typically functional in character, and do not contain religious symbols. Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose ""territory"" they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as ""meetings"" as scheduled by congregation elders. The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible. The format of the meetings is established by the religion's headquarters, and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide. Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours, typically gathering mid-week (three meetings) and on the weekend (two meetings). Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for ""family worship"". Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs (hymns) and brief prayers. Twice each year, Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a ""circuit"" gather for a one-day assembly. Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day ""regional convention"", usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums.

Relevant context: Jehovah’s Witnesses are known for their structured and organized gatherings, which are typically conducted in their place of worship known as the Kingdom Hall. These meetings are central to their faith and serve both educational and communal purposes. A key aspect of these gatherings is how they are opened and closed, reflecting their spiritual focus and emphasis on prayer and community.

Each meeting, whether it is their midweek life and ministry meeting or the weekend public meeting, is customarily opened with a song and a prayer. The song, selected from their official songbook ""Sing Out Joyfully"", is intended to set a reverent tone and encourage unity among attendees. The music is often played from a recorded track, and all in attendance are invited to join in singing the lyrics, which are displayed on a screen.

Following the song, a prayer is offered. This opening prayer is typically given by an elder or another designated male member of the congregation. The prayer aims to express gratitude, seek guidance, and invite divine blessing upon the proceedings.

At the conclusion of the meeting, another song is sung, similar to the one at the opening, serving to punctuate the session and reaffirm the biblical teachings discussed.

Noting that Gaddafi's favourite hobbies were reading and playing football, he thought him an ""amusing officer, always cheerful, hard-working, and conscientious."" Gaddafi disliked England, claiming British Army officers racially insulted him and finding it difficult adjusting to the country's culture; asserting his Arab identity in London, he walked around Piccadilly wearing traditional Libyan robes.

Relevant context: Muammar Gaddafi, the former Libyan leader, traveled to England on several occasions, with his visits embodying a blend of curiosity, skepticism, and criticism towards Western culture. During one of his notable trips in the 1970s, when he was still consolidating power in Libya, Gaddafi demonstrated a complex reaction to English culture, which reflected his broader stance on Western influence.

Gaddafi was intrigued by certain technological advancements and historical aspects of England, notably expressing admiration for the parliamentary system's longevity and resilience, although he was critical of its imperial past and the ongoing influence of colonialism. He paid particular attention to the way English society was structured, noting the coexistence of tradition and modernity. In some private discussions, he expressed a keen interest in the British educational system and its historical impact on global education.

However, Gaddafi was also vocally critical of what he perceived as the materialism and moral decadence prevalent in Western cultures. In public statements during his visit, he condemned the focus on consumerist values over community welfare and criticized the cultural imperialism that Western countries often imposed on other nations. He was particularly disapproving of the foreign policy stances adopted by the UK, especially in relation to the Middle East and North Africa.

In meetings with British officials and intellectuals, Gaddafi often juxtaposed Libyan and Islamic values with those of the West, advocating for a more prominent role for religion in governance and law, as opposed to the secular ethos prevalent in England. This cultural dialogue was underscored by Gaddafi's revolutionary ideology, which he was in the process of outlining in his Green Book, emphasizing a third universal theory distinct from both capitalism and communism.

Gaddafi's visits to England were less about immersion in its culture and more about a critical engagement that highlighted the ideological and cultural divides between Libya and the West. Through both his praise and his censure, Gaddafi's responses to English culture were emblematic of his broader worldview, which was characterized by a desire to forge a unique cultural and political identity for Libya that resisted Western hegemony.",446.0,1997.0,2504,1.0,1.0,1.0,10.82381820678711,0.9755806922912598,12.730114221572876,Disliked,0.0
"The jat-reflex rules are not without exception. For example, when short jat is preceded by r, in most Ijekavian dialects developed into /re/ or, occasionally, /ri/. The prefix prě- (""trans-, over-"") when long became pre- in eastern Ijekavian dialects but to prije- in western dialects; in Ikavian pronunciation, it also evolved into pre- or prije- due to potential ambiguity with pri- (""approach, come close to""). For verbs that had -ěti in their infinitive, the past participle ending -ěl evolved into -io in Ijekavian Neoštokavian.","What is the western equivalent of the prefix ""pre""?",prije,0,DESC,"What is the western equivalent of the prefix ""pre""?

Relevant context: The prefix ""pre-"" is commonly used in English to mean ""before"" or ""in advance of,"" originating from the Latin preposition ""prae,"" which carries the same meaning. In Western languages, especially those deriving from Latin, there isn't always a direct one-to-one equivalent for every prefix. However, if we consider Western Germanic languages, like German, the equivalent of ""pre-"" can often be expressed using similar constructions or context-specific words rather than direct prefixes.

In German, for instance, while there isn't a universal prefix that mirrors ""pre-"" perfectly across all contexts, the concept of ""before"" or ""prior to"" is often communicated using the prefix ""vor-."" This is seen in words like ""Vorspiel"" (prelude) or ""Vorstellung"" (preview), where ""vor-"" indicates something occurring before another event or in anticipation of it.

Additionally, in Romance languages, which are closely related to English through their shared Latin heritage, ""pre-"" is often used in a similar manner or retained as is. For example, in French, you have ""préparer"" (to prepare), which directly uses the prefix ""pré-,"" demonstrating how the Latin influence permeates these languages, maintaining a stable grammatical and semantic function.

It is essential to understand that while prefixes in languages can have similar meanings, translations often require context-specific adjustments. English, with its rich borrowing from Latin, retains many such prefixes, which may not always have neat equivalents in other Western languages, but through linguistic adaptation and the use of analogous prefixes or entirely different constructions, similar meanings can be conveyed.

Therefore, in a broad comparison, ""vor-"" in German could be seen as a potential counterpart to ""pre-"" in some instances, although the usage heavily depends on the specific word and its context. In other Western languages that share Latin roots, like Italian and Spanish, ""pre-"" is often retained, emphasizing the cultural and historical ties that bind these languages together.",409.0,1278.0,1744,1.0,1.0,1.0,94.55825567245483,1.0729551315307617,96.94965291023254,prije,1.0
"In the Roman Church, universal positive ecclesiastical laws, based upon either immutable divine and natural law, or changeable circumstantial and merely positive law, derive formal authority and promulgation from the office of pope, who as Supreme Pontiff possesses the totality of legislative, executive, and judicial power in his person. The actual subject material of the canons is not just doctrinal or moral in nature, but all-encompassing of the human condition.",What are the impermanent sources of positive ecclesiastical law?,changeable circumstantial and merely positive law,0,DESC,"What are the impermanent sources of positive ecclesiastical law?

Relevant context: In the framework of ecclesiastical law, positive law refers to the set of legal rules that are formally enacted by ecclesiastical authority, as opposed to natural law, which is understood to be inherent and universally binding. When considering the impermanent sources of positive ecclesiastical law, we are looking at those sources that, unlike divine or natural law, are subject to change and adaptation as determined by the Church’s legislative authority. 

One key impermanent source of positive ecclesiastical law is papal legislation. This includes papal decrees, encyclicals, apostolic constitutions, and motu proprios, all of which are formal documents issued by the Pope to address specific issues, guide the faithful, or reform ecclesial structures and practices. Although these documents hold significant authority, they can be amended or abrogated by future Popes, reflecting the changing needs and circumstances of the Church.

Another significant impermanent source is ecumenical councils. The decrees and canons issued by these councils have historically shaped Church discipline and governance. Vatican II, for example, significantly revised the Church’s liturgical practices and its stance on ecumenism. While council decrees are critically important and carry substantial authority, they remain subject to further modification or even reversal by future councils as the Church continues to discern and respond to new challenges and contexts.

Furthermore, the Code of Canon Law stands as a crucial source—a comprehensive codification of ecclesiastical laws pertaining to the governance of the Church, the regulation of sacraments, and the rights and obligations of the faithful. The code can be revised to adapt to contemporary pastoral needs, such as the revisions enacted in the 1983 Code, which updated the 1917 Pio-Benedictine Code in light of the Second Vatican Council.

Additionally, synodal legislation at both the national and diocesan levels provides another example of impermanent sources. Bishops’ conferences or diocesan synods may issue directives or guidelines that apply to their specific jurisdictions, addressing pastoral needs peculiar to their regions. These rulings, while authoritative locally, can be revised or annulled as situations evolve.

In essence, the impermanent sources of positive ecclesiastical law play a dynamic role in adapting the Church’s governance and practice to an ever-changing world, while maintaining fidelity to its mission and tradition. This flexibility underscores the Church’s recognition of the need for pastoral adaptation and the temporal nature of human societal contexts, always in pursuit of a deeper expression of its enduring faith.",519.0,1323.0,1903,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.113264560699463,2.2033212184906006,8.49370002746582,Changeable circumstantial law,0.5
"Aristotle of Stagira, the most important disciple of Plato, shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity. But while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience. Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of Greek philosophy from other founders during ancient times were Stoicism, Epicureanism, Skepticism and Neoplatonism.",Plato's philosophy attempted to explain life from what standpoint?,the supra-sensual,0,DESC,"Plato's philosophy attempted to explain life from what standpoint?

Relevant context: Plato's philosophy attempts to explain life from the standpoint of idealism, emphasizing the existence of an overarching realm of forms or ideas. He posits that the physical world perceived by our senses is merely a shadow of a higher, more perfect reality. This metaphysical viewpoint is central to his thought, especially as illustrated in his allegory of the cave, which appears in Book VII of ""The Republic."" According to Plato, the material world is transient and imperfect, while the world of forms is eternal and immutable.

Plato argues that true knowledge is not derived from sensory experience but from intellectual reasoning and understanding of these abstract forms. He believes that the soul, which exists apart from the physical body, inherently knows these forms but forgets them upon entering the body. Through the process of anamnesis, or recollection, one can come to remember and understand the forms, thus achieving genuine knowledge and enlightenment.

Furthermore, in his works, Plato often explores the implications of this idealistic standpoint for ethics, politics, and aesthetics. For instance, in ""The Republic,"" he outlines his vision of a just society based on the rule of philosopher-kings, those who have grasped the truth of the forms and can govern in accordance with the ultimate good. Plato's idealism thus provides a framework for understanding both individual virtue and societal harmony by aligning life with the immutable truths of the forms.

Overall, Plato's philosophy encourages a life oriented toward the pursuit of truth and wisdom beyond the fleeting appearances of the material world, advocating for a deeper, more reflective existence connected to the eternal and the ideal.",333.0,1474.0,1870,1.0,0.16666666666666666,0.3562071871080222,3.7040743827819824,1.3550827503204346,6.229895830154419,Supra-sensual standpoint of the forms,0.5
"The tradition holds that Virgil was born in the village of Andes, near Mantua in Cisalpine Gaul. Analysis of his name has led to beliefs that he descended from earlier Roman colonists. Modern speculation ultimately is not supported by narrative evidence either from his own writings or his later biographers. Macrobius says that Virgil's father was of a humble background; however, scholars generally believe that Virgil was from an equestrian landowning family which could afford to give him an education.

After considering briefly a career in rhetoric and law, the young Virgil turned his talents to poetry.",Does Macrobius believe Virgil's father came from a distinguished or humble background?,humble,0,DESC,"Does Macrobius believe Virgil's father came from a distinguished or humble background?

Relevant context: Macrobius, in his work ""Saturnalia,"" provides various insights into the life and works of Virgil, the renowned Roman poet. While discussing the origins of Virgil's family, Macrobius tends to emphasize the poet’s illustrious talent over his familial background. However, he does touch upon the status of Virgil's parents, particularly his father. According to Macrobius, Virgil's father came from a rather humble background. This detail is particularly highlighted when Macrobius draws attention to the modest beginnings and the rural life Virgil's father led, which contrasts sharply with Virgil's later prominence and the respect he garnered in Roman society.

Macrobius does not dwell excessively on the specifics of Virgil's paternal lineage, but he does acknowledge that Virgil's literary genius outshone the relative obscurity of his ancestry. His father, though not distinguished by noble birth or wealth, was instrumental in fostering Virgil's education—a decision that Macrobius suggests was pivotal in Virgil's development as a poet. This narrative aligns with the broader theme in Roman literature and history that esteemed personal merit and achievement over inherited status. Thus, through Macrobius's account, one can infer that he views Virgil's father as coming from a humble background, with the emphasis on the remarkable rise of his son as one of Rome's most celebrated poets.",297.0,2233.0,2592,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.60073709487915,4.34962010383606,11.092064619064331,Humble,1.0
"By 1763, the war in Central Europe was essentially a stalemate. Frederick had retaken most of Silesia and Saxony but not the latter's capital, Dresden. His financial situation was not dire, but his kingdom was devastated and his army severely weakened. His manpower had dramatically decreased, and he had lost so many effective officers and generals that a new offensive was perhaps impossible. British subsidies had been stopped by the new Prime Minister Lord Bute, and the Russian Emperor had been overthrown by his wife, Catherine, who ended Russia's alliance with Prussia and withdrew from the war. Austria, however, like most participants, was facing a severe financial crisis and had to decrease the size of its army, something which greatly affected its offensive power. Indeed, after having effectively sustained a long war, its administration was in disarray. By that time, it still held Dresden, the southeastern parts of Saxony, the county of Glatz, and southern Silesia, but the prospect of victory was dim without Russian support.

Relevant context: After returning from their grueling campaign in Russia, Frederick's extra troops faced numerous challenges that significantly impacted their effectiveness. The harsh Russian winter had taken a severe toll on the soldiers, resulting in substantial losses due to frostbite and disease. Many troops had either succumbed to the cold or been incapacitated, leaving their numbers greatly diminished compared to when they set out.

Upon their return, those who had survived found themselves in dire need of recuperation. The logistical challenges of the campaign meant that supplies were scarce, and the soldiers had endured long periods with inadequate food and shelter. This left many of them malnourished and weakened, requiring several months of recovery before they could be reintegrated into active duty.

Additionally, the withdrawal from Russia had been chaotic and disorganized, leading to problems with troop cohesion and morale. The lack of clear leadership during the retreat resulted in frequent desertions, further reducing the number of troops that returned to join Frederick. To compound these difficulties, the troops had also lost much of their equipment, either abandoned during the retreat or destroyed in skirmishes with pursuing forces.

Frederick attempted to rebuild the shattered remnants of his forces by recalling reserves and initiating new rounds of recruitment and training. However, this was a slow and costly process. Replenishing the ranks required significant investment in both time and resources, as new recruits needed to be trained and equipped to replace the experienced soldiers who had been lost. The morale of the returning troops was another critical issue that needed to be addressed, as the psychological scars of the campaign weighed heavily on those who had experienced it firsthand.

Overall, the ordeal in Russia had left Frederick's extra troops in disarray, necessitating a period of rebuilding and reorganization to restore their previous effectiveness.

"Most Western languages (particularly those with writing systems based on the Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Coptic, and Armenian alphabets) use letter cases in their written form as an aid to clarity. Scripts using two separate cases are also called bicameral scripts. Many other writing systems make no distinction between majuscules and minuscules – a system called unicameral script or unicase. This includes most syllabic and other non-alphabetic scripts. The Georgian alphabet is special since it used to be bicameral, but today is mostly used in a unicameral way.",What are writing systems which make no distinction between majuscales and minuscules often referred to as?,unicameral script,0,DESC,"What are writing systems which make no distinction between majuscales and minuscules often referred to as?

Relevant context: Writing systems that make no distinction between majuscules and minuscules are typically referred to as ""unicase"" or ""unicameral"" writing systems. These terms describe scripts that use a singular case for all letters, without any differentiation between uppercase (capital) and lowercase (small) forms. 

Several historical and contemporary scripts are considered unicase. For instance, ancient Greek initially did not distinguish between different letter cases. It wasn't until the Hellenistic period that the Greeks began using what we now recognize as capital letters, with the later introduction of lowercase script during the Byzantine era for more efficient manuscript writing. 

Another example is the early Latin script, which was initially unicase. The distinction between majuscules and minuscules evolved over centuries, particularly influenced by the development of the Carolingian minuscule in the medieval period, which became the basis for modern lowercase letters in the Latin alphabet. 

In modern times, scripts such as Hebrew and Arabic are considered unicase because they use a single form for each letter in their standard orthographies, regardless of position in a word. Furthermore, scriptio continua, or the practice of writing without spaces between words, was often used in these unicase systems, affecting how text was visually parsed.

Unicase systems can also be created as part of stylistic or artistic endeavors, especially in typography and digital text design, where some fonts are designed to maintain a consistent letter form throughout. The design choice can influence readability and aesthetics, dictated by the context in which the text will be utilized. 

Understanding the concept of unicase systems helps in appreciating the diverse history and function of writing throughout human civilization, reflecting both the evolution of language and the technological advancements that facilitate written communication.",369.0,1376.0,1813,1.0,1.0,1.0,83.30227637290955,1.010974407196045,85.58700394630432,Unicameral scripts,0.9

Relevant context: Expulsion from the Jehovah’s Witnesses, known as disfellowshipping, is a process employed by the organization to maintain the moral and spiritual purity of its congregation. Since 1961, the criteria for disfellowshipping have centered around serious violations of biblical principles, which are deemed incompatible with the core beliefs and practices of the faith.

Key grounds for disfellowshipping include acts of immorality, such as fornication, adultery, and abuse of drugs or alcohol, which are considered violations of the congregation’s expectations for moral conduct. Utter disregard for these behavioral guidelines often leads to expulsion after a thorough investigation by the local congregation’s elders.

Another ground is the act of apostasy, which involves the deliberate abandonment of or rebellion against Jehovah's Witnesses’ teachings and principles. Engaging in the promotion of religious teachings contrary to the established doctrines or forming alliances with other religious groups can result in expulsion. This is often regarded as particularly serious since it affects the spiritual well-being of other members.

Furthermore, an unrepentant attitude towards serious sin, where an individual neither seeks forgiveness nor demonstrates a willingness to change behavior, reinforces the decision to disfellowship. Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that repentance is a crucial step in reforming one’s behavior, and a persistent lack of remorse is seen as a rejection of their spiritual counsel.

Jehovah’s Witnesses also disfellowship members for serious cases of lying or slander, which disrupt the trust and unity within the congregation. Such actions, if left uncorrected, can harm the community’s cohesion and spiritual atmosphere.

It is important to note that the decision to disfellowship is not taken lightly. It follows careful consideration and multiple attempts to spiritually counsel and guide the individual back within the fold of accepted behavior. The intent is always for such an individual to eventually return, rehabilitated, to the congregation, should they make amends and demonstrate genuine repentance.

Overall, since 1961, these grounds for expulsion stem from the organization’s desire to uphold scriptural standards, promote spiritual healing, and protect the sanctity of the congregation.

"The Sumerians were a non-Semitic caucasoid people, and spoke a language isolate; a number of linguists believed they could detect a substrate language beneath Sumerian, because names of some of Sumer's major cities are not Sumerian, revealing influences of earlier inhabitants. However, the archaeological record shows clear uninterrupted cultural continuity from the time of the early Ubaid period (5300 – 4700 BC C-14) settlements in southern Mesopotamia. The Sumerian people who settled here farmed the lands in this region that were made fertile by silt deposited by the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers.",Why were the lands in the region the Sumerian people settled fertile?,silt deposited by the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers,0,DESC,"Why were the lands in the region the Sumerian people settled fertile?

Relevant context: The region where the Sumerian people settled, known as Mesopotamia, particularly in the southern part that corresponds to present-day southern Iraq, was remarkably fertile due to several key geographical and environmental factors. This fertility was primarily due to the presence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which flow through the region. These rivers provided a crucial source of water in an otherwise arid landscape and were responsible for creating a rich plain that could support extensive agriculture.

One of the primary reasons for the fertility of the land was the annual flooding of these rivers. Each year, the Tigris and Euphrates would overflow their banks in the springtime, caused by melting snow from the mountains to the north and seasonal rains. This flooding deposited a layer of nutrient-rich silt onto the surrounding lands, replenishing the soil and making it highly productive for farming. The silt contained minerals and organic materials that enhanced the soil’s fertility, allowing the Sumerians to cultivate crops such as barley, wheat, and various fruits and vegetables.

The Sumerians also developed sophisticated irrigation systems to manage the water supply from the rivers. They built canals, dikes, and reservoirs to control the flow of water, enabling them to irrigate their fields even during dry periods. This ingenuity in water management not only improved the productivity of their agriculture but also expanded the arable land, transforming the region into a breadbasket.

Moreover, the flat topography of the Mesopotamian plain facilitated the construction of these irrigation systems. Unlike regions with rugged terrain, the plains allowed for easier distribution of water over large areas. This factor, combined with the predictable pattern of river flooding and the Sumerians’ engineering skills, contributed significantly to the region’s agricultural productivity.

Additionally, the climate, although largely arid, provided hot summers and mild winters, which supported year-round crop cultivation. The availability of such fertile land enabled the Sumerians to produce surplus food, which was a critical factor in supporting their growing population and the development of their civilization.

In summary, the fertility of the land where the Sumerians settled was due to the beneficial natural flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which deposited rich silt onto the plains, the development of advanced irrigation methods, and the conducive climate and topography of the region—factors that collectively fostered a highly productive agricultural system that sustained one of the world's earliest civilizations.",506.0,1698.0,2265,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,13.142566204071045,1.1371803283691406,15.367156505584717,Silt deposition,0.7

Relevant context: Eritrea's popular alcoholic beverage, Mies, is a traditional drink often enjoyed during social gatherings and celebrations. Mies, also known as T’ej in other parts of the Horn of Africa, is an aromatic honey wine that has been crafted for centuries. The primary ingredient in Mies is pure honey, which serves as the base for fermentation. To prepare Mies, honey is mixed with water and then seasoned with a variety of spices and herbs. One of the most common spices added to Mies is gesho, a type of buckthorn leaf that plays a crucial role in the fermentation process and imparts a unique, slightly bitter flavor that balances the sweetness of the honey.

The preparation of Mies involves allowing the honey and water mixture, along with the added spices, to ferment over a period of weeks to months, depending on the desired strength and flavor profile. This fermentation process is crucial, as it converts the sugars in the honey into alcohol, resulting in a rich, mildly sweet beverage that can range in alcohol content. The end product is a golden-hued drink with a smooth texture and a complex flavor profile, deliciously combining elements of sweetness, spice, and floral notes from the honey.

Mies is traditionally consumed on special occasions such as weddings and religious festivals, but it has also found its place in everyday social gatherings, where it is enjoyed in moderation.

"In some languages, such as English, aspiration is allophonic. Stops are distinguished primarily by voicing, and voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated, while voiced stops are usually unaspirated.",How are stops distinguished?,voicing,0,DESC,"How are stops distinguished?

Relevant context: To understand how stops are distinguished, it's important to delve into the phonetic and linguistic characteristics that define them. Stops, also known as plosives, are a category of consonant sounds produced by obstructing airflow in the vocal tract, building up pressure, and then releasing it. This process involves three key stages: closure, hold, and release.

Firstly, the point of articulation, or the place where the airflow obstruction occurs, is crucial in distinguishing different stops. For example, bilabial stops like /p/ and /b/ occur when both lips come together to block the airflow, alveolar stops like /t/ and /d/ form when the tongue hits the alveolar ridge just behind the teeth, and velar stops such as /k/ and /g/ are articulated with the back of the tongue against the soft palate.

Additionally, stops are distinguished by voicing. Voiced stops, such as /b/, /d/, and /g/, involve the vibration of the vocal cords during the obstruction, whereas voiceless stops like /p/, /t/, and /k/ do not. This difference in vibration creates a distinct auditory perception.

Another way stops are distinguished is by their aspiration. In languages like English, voiceless stops can have an aspirated version, such as the /p/ in ""pat,"" where a burst of breath follows the release of the stop. This contrasts with the unaspirated /p/ in ""spin.""

In certain languages, stops can also be differentiated by other features such as length or gemination, nasalization, and the presence of a glottal stop, which involves a brief closure of the vocal cords.

In summary, stops are distinguished by features such as the point of articulation, voicing, aspiration, and sometimes additional phonetic features like length or nasalization. These characteristics not only help in classifying stops within a language but also play a critical role in how they are perceived and understood across different languages.",410.0,1085.0,1545,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,14.896464824676514,1.5763514041900635,17.665677309036255,Aspiration,0.0
"Some Christian writers considered the possibility that pagan commentators may have mentioned this event, mistaking it for a solar eclipse - although this would have been impossible during the Passover, which takes place at the full moon. Christian traveller and historian Sextus Julius Africanus and Christian theologian Origen refer to Greek historian Phlegon, who lived in the 2nd century AD, as having written ""with regard to the eclipse in the time of Tiberius Caesar, in whose reign Jesus appears to have been crucified, and the great earthquakes which then took place""",Why was a solar eclipse impossible?,the full moon,0,DESC,"Why was a solar eclipse impossible?

Relevant context: In addressing the query of why a solar eclipse might be considered impossible, it is crucial to delve into the astronomical and geometric prerequisites necessary for such an event to occur. A solar eclipse happens when the Moon moves directly between the Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow on the Earth and obscuring the Sun either partially or wholly from view. For a solar eclipse to take place, three primary conditions must be met: alignment of celestial bodies, appropriate angular size, and an orbital intersection known as a node.

Firstly, the alignment condition requires the Sun, Moon, and Earth to be precisely aligned in a straight or nearly straight line, a situation typically occurring only during a new moon phase. Even during a new moon, however, the inclined orbit of the Moon—about 5 degrees relative to Earth's orbital plane (the ecliptic)—means that often the Moon passes above or below the Sun's apparent path as seen from Earth.

Secondly, the apparent size of the Moon, as observed from Earth, must be sufficient to at least partially cover the Sun. Remarkably, the Moon is about 400 times smaller in diameter than the Sun but also approximately 400 times closer to Earth, making their apparent sizes in the sky nearly identical. This delicate balance allows solar eclipses to occur; however, variations in the Moon’s distance from Earth due to its elliptical orbit can affect this ratio.

Thirdly, a solar eclipse requires that the new moon aligns at or near one of the nodes of its orbit—the points where the orbit of the Moon intersects the ecliptic plane. These intersections are vital, as they are the positions that can lead to the necessary alignment for an eclipse. The Moon’s orbital points, known as nodes, precess or drift over time, completing a cycle roughly every 18.6 years. Only around these nodes can alignment occur during the new moon phase.

Failing any of these conditions renders a solar eclipse impossible. If the Earth, Moon, and Sun do not achieve precise alignment, or if the Moon is not in the right position in its orbit to intersect the ecliptic plane at the time of the new moon phase, then a solar eclipse cannot occur. Moreover, should any variance in orbital mechanics push these celestial bodies out of alignment at necessary times—for instance, during critical alignments dictated by gravitational perturbations or catastrophic extraterrestrial events—solar eclipses could be rendered impossible until such a situation is rectified.

In historical or speculative contexts, a solar eclipse may be imagined as impossible due to mythological explanations, such as divine intervention or omens, reflecting cultural interpretations of celestial events beyond scientific understanding at the time.

Understanding these astronomical intricacies helps clarify why, under certain conditions, a solar eclipse might be deemed ""impossible,"" highlighting the precise cosmic choreography required to witness such a phenomenon.",574.0,1626.0,2252,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,11.695297241210938,1.2758986949920654,14.18583059310913,Passover,0.0
"Russian is a Slavic language of the Indo-European family. It is a lineal descendant of the language used in Kievan Rus'. From the point of view of the spoken language, its closest relatives are Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Rusyn, the other three languages in the East Slavic group. In many places in eastern and southern Ukraine and throughout Belarus, these languages are spoken interchangeably, and in certain areas traditional bilingualism resulted in language mixtures, e.g. Surzhyk in eastern Ukraine and Trasianka in Belarus. An East Slavic Old Novgorod dialect, although vanished during the 15th or 16th century, is sometimes considered to have played a significant role in the formation of modern Russian. Also Russian has notable lexical similarities with Bulgarian due to a common Church Slavonic influence on both languages, as well as because of later interaction in the 19th–20th centuries, although Bulgarian grammar differs markedly from Russian. In the 19th century, the language was often called ""Great Russian"" to distinguish it from Belarusian, then called ""White Russian"" and Ukrainian, then called ""Little Russian"".",What are Russian's closest relatives?,"Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Rusyn",0,DESC,"What are Russian's closest relatives?

Relevant context: When discussing the closest relatives of the Russian language, we delve into the broader context of its linguistic family. Russian is part of the East Slavic group within the Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family. The closest relatives to Russian are, therefore, those languages that share direct historical and linguistic ancestry within the East Slavic subgroup, which include Ukrainian and Belarusian.

Ukrainian is often considered the closest relative to Russian, both historically and linguistically. Ukrainian and Russian share a significant amount of vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation similarities due to their common roots and historical interactions. However, Ukrainian has retained some features more reminiscent of older Slavic languages, and it continues to evolve with distinct influences from Polish and other Central European languages.

Belarusian is another close relative, with even more striking similarities to Russian in terms of shared vocabulary and grammar. Despite the influence of neighboring languages and its unique developments, Belarusian remains a closely connected linguistic cousin to Russian, and the two languages are mutually intelligible to a significant degree.

The three East Slavic languages—Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian—originated from Old East Slavic, the language of the medieval state of Kievan Rus'. Over time, due to political, geographical, and social factors, they diverged into the distinct languages we recognize today.

Beyond the East Slavic languages, Russian is also distantly related to the West Slavic and South Slavic language groups. West Slavic languages, such as Polish, Czech, and Slovak, as well as South Slavic languages, including Bulgarian, Serbian, and Croatian, share a more distant common ancestor with Russian, making them genetically related but less directly comparable in terms of mutual intelligibility.

Understanding these relationships highlights the complex tapestry of Slavic linguistic development and showcases how historical migrations, cultural exchange, and political boundaries have shaped the languages of Eastern Europe. Russian, with its rich literary and cultural heritage, remains a central pillar within the East Slavic language family, closely linked to Ukrainian and Belarusian and sharing ancient ties with other Slavic languages across the continent.",429.0,1272.0,1761,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.172380447387695,6.163017988204956,11.479795217514038,"Ukrainian, Belarusian, Rusyn",1.0
"However, the Orthodox claim to absolute fidelity to past tradition has been challenged by scholars who contend that the Judaism of the Middle Ages bore little resemblance to that practiced by today's Orthodox. Rather, the Orthodox community, as a counterreaction to the liberalism of the Haskalah movement, began to embrace far more stringent halachic practices than their predecessors, most notably in matters of Kashrut and Passover dietary laws, where the strictest possible interpretation becomes a religious requirement, even where the Talmud explicitly prefers a more lenient position, and even where a more lenient position was practiced by prior generations.",What are dietary laws known as?,halachic practices,0,DESC,"What are dietary laws known as?

Relevant context: Dietary laws, often referred to as ""dietary regulations"" or ""food laws,"" are a set of guidelines or rules that dictate what people can and cannot eat according to their religious, cultural, or ethical beliefs. These laws vary widely across different cultures and religions and often play a significant role in maintaining cultural identity and expressing religious devotion.

In the context of Judaism, dietary laws are known as ""Kashrut"" or ""Kosher Laws."" These laws are derived from the Torah and include detailed instructions about which foods are permissible (""kosher"") and which are forbidden. For instance, kosher laws prohibit the consumption of pork and shellfish, and require that meat and dairy products not be eaten together. Additionally, animals must be slaughtered in a specific manner to be considered kosher.

Islamic dietary laws are known as ""Halal,"" which means ""permissible"" in Arabic. Foods that are considered Halal are those that meet the criteria established by Islamic law as outlined in the Quran. Similar to kosher laws, Halal stipulates certain restrictions, such as the prohibition of pork and the requirement that meat be sourced from animals slaughtered in the name of Allah, known as ""Dhabiha."" Foods that do not meet these criteria are termed ""Haram,"" meaning ""forbidden.""

In Hinduism, dietary practices are deeply influenced by the principle of ""Ahimsa"" or non-violence, leading many adherents to vegetarianism. Hindu dietary laws are not as uniformly codified as in Judaism or Islam but often include abstaining from beef, as the cow is considered sacred.

These dietary laws are not limited to religious contexts; for example, cultural practices and health considerations also influence what is deemed appropriate to eat. In Buddhism, particularly among monastic communities, the focus is often on vegetarianism, although practices can vary significantly across different sects.

Dietary laws are thus a reflection of the values and beliefs of a community and can be seen as a bridge between spiritual ideals and daily living practices. They not only govern eating habits but also serve to create a sense of community among those who adhere to the same guidelines. Understanding these diverse dietary laws provides insight into the fundamental tenets that shape various cultures and religions around the world.",460.0,1813.0,2326,1.0,0.14285714285714285,0.3333333333333333,5.484539031982422,1.201901912689209,7.761160135269165,Kashrut,0.5
"In the wake of the racially-motivated"" church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, Yale was under criticism again in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, which was named after John C. Calhoun, a slave-owner and strong slavery supporter in the nineteenth century. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change. They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an ""extraordinary American statesman""—he was ""one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy"" in the history of the United States. In August 2015 Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed. He described Calhoun as a ""a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina."" He acknowledged that Calhoun also ""believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests."" Racial tensions increased in the fall of 2015 centering on comments by Nicholas A. Christakis and his wife Erika regarding freedom of speech. In April 2016 Salovey announced that ""despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests,"" Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's ""shadow"" so they will be ""better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future."" He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would ""obscure"" his ""legacy of slavery rather than addressing it."" ""Yale is part of that history"" and ""We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it."" One change that will be issued is the title of “master” for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to “head of college” due to its connotation of slavery.",Why did people dislike the college being named after John C. Calhoun?,a slave-owner and strong slavery supporter in the nineteenth century,0,DESC,"Why did people dislike the college being named after John C. Calhoun?

Relevant context: John C. Calhoun, a prominent 19th-century American politician and political theorist, is a figure associated with deeply controversial views and policies, particularly regarding his staunch defense of slavery and white supremacy. The college named after him, most notably Calhoun College at Yale University, became a focal point of widespread debate and criticism due to its association with these aspects of his legacy.

Calhoun served as vice president of the United States from 1825 to 1832 and was a key advocate for states' rights and the institution of slavery, which he infamously described as a ""positive good."" His arguments underpinning secessionist and pro-slavery sentiments contributed significantly to the ideological framework that led to the American Civil War. As a result, Calhoun's legacy is mired in the promotion of racial inequality and the subjugation of African Americans.

The controversy surrounding institutions named after Calhoun intensified in the 21st century, especially amid broader societal reckonings with systemic racism and the legacy of slavery in the United States. Many students, faculty, and alumni argued that honoring Calhoun in such a manner commemorated and perpetuated his racist beliefs, making marginalized members of the community feel unwelcome and invalidated. They contended that the continued use of Calhoun's name glorified a historical figure whose actions and ideologies were antithetical to the principles of diversity, inclusion, and equality that modern educational institutions claim to uphold.

Moreover, activists pointed out the particular inappropriateness of venerating a figure like Calhoun at an institution with aspirations of leading on social justice, arguing that it was representative of a broader issue regarding how history and historical figures should be remembered or honored. Critics advocated for renaming the college to reflect values and individuals more aligned with contemporary ethical standards, promoting a version of history that acknowledges past injustices while striving for a more equitable future.

In response to this growing pressure, Yale University conducted extensive reviews and discussions concerning the name of Calhoun College. This led to the decision in 2017 to rename the college after Grace Hopper, a Yale alumna and pioneering computer scientist, intending to align more closely with values that the university sought to embrace, such as innovation, inclusivity, and a commitment to positive social change.

The renaming of the college from John C. Calhoun to Grace Hopper Avenue was seen by many as an important step toward acknowledging and redressing historical wrongs. It was also viewed as part of a larger cultural transformation where institutions were being called upon to reflect critically on whom they honor and why, thus reshaping narratives to better fit with evolved societal values and understandings of justice and equality.",564.0,2280.0,2906,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.10559344291687,1.1324572563171387,7.4299538135528564,Slavery supporter,0.5
"Orthodox Judaism maintains the historical understanding of Jewish identity. A Jew is someone who was born to a Jewish mother, or who converts to Judaism in accordance with Jewish law and tradition. Orthodoxy thus rejects patrilineal descent as a means of establishing Jewish identity. Similarly, Orthodoxy strongly condemns intermarriage. Intermarriage is seen as a deliberate rejection of Judaism, and an intermarried person is effectively cut off from most of the Orthodox community. However, some Orthodox Jewish organizations do reach out to intermarried Jews.",What happens to most intermarried people in the orthodox community?,cut off,0,DESC,"What happens to most intermarried people in the orthodox community?

Relevant context: In Orthodox Jewish communities, marriage is considered a cornerstone of religious and communal life, and the standards for marriage often include marrying within the faith and community. However, in cases of intermarriage, where one partner is not Jewish, the dynamics can be complex.

Most Orthodox communities maintain strict adherence to Jewish law (halacha), which prescribes marrying within the Jewish faith. When a member of the Orthodox community marries someone who is not Jewish, it often leads to significant social and religious challenges. The rabbinical authorities in these communities generally do not recognize such marriages, and they may not officiate them. As a result, intermarried couples might not have their union acknowledged within the community, leading to various consequences.

The implications for intermarried individuals can vary widely depending on the specific community and levels of observance. In some cases, the Jewish partner might experience social ostracism, as the community may distance itself from those who do not adhere to its norms. This can affect not only the individual but also their family and social connections within the community. Depending on the community's stance, the children of such marriages, if the mother is non-Jewish, may not be considered Jewish by Orthodox standards unless they undergo a recognized conversion process.

Some Orthodox Jews who intermarry might choose to leave their community voluntarily, seeking environments where there is less scrutiny and more acceptance of diverse family structures. Others may attempt to navigate the complexities, often balancing between maintaining some level of community involvement while adapting to their new familial dynamics.

In other instances, efforts for conversion may become part of the family experience. If the non-Jewish spouse wishes to convert to Judaism, Orthodox conversions are typically a rigorous process, requiring sincere commitment to Orthodox Jewish beliefs and practices. This process can facilitate greater acceptance within the community, although it can be lengthy and demanding.

Overall, intermarried individuals in the Orthodox community face unique challenges as they contend with religious, cultural, and social expectations. The outcome for many involves a delicate balance between personal relationships and adherence to community norms, with varying degrees of acceptance and integration depending on individual and communal circumstances.",443.0,1616.0,2117,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.725898027420044,6.437475681304932,12.255173921585083,Cut off,1.0

Relevant context: The leadership race between Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott in 2009 was a highly contentious and closely contested event within the Liberal Party of Australia. The leadership spill occurred on December 1, 2009, against a backdrop of internal divisions over the party's stance on climate change, specifically the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) proposed by then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's Labor government.

Turnbull, who had been the leader of the opposition since September 2008, faced a significant challenge from Abbott, primarily fueled by dissatisfaction within the party ranks over Turnbull's support for the ETS. This issue proved to be highly polarizing, with many conservative members viewing it as a betrayal of the party's principles.

The actual vote was incredibly close. The leadership ballot resulted in a narrow victory for Tony Abbott, who won by just a single vote, defeating Turnbull 42-41. This tight margin reflected the deep divisions within the party, with neither side having a clear, overwhelming mandate. Abbott's victory marked a significant shift in the party's direction, particularly on environmental policy, and set the stage for future political dynamics in Australian politics.

This leadership spill was notable not only for the closeness of the race but also for the immediate impact it had on the party's policy positions and public image. Abbott's ascension to the leadership led to a more hardline stance against climate change legislation, which subsequently influenced the broader national debate on the issue.

With a changing society, more citizens have begun to press for acknowledging multiracial ancestry. The Census Bureau changed its data collection by allowing people to self-identify as more than one ethnicity. Some ethnic groups are concerned about the potential political and economic effects, as federal assistance to historically underserved groups has depended on Census data.

Relevant context: Federal assistance is often allocated to certain groups through a combination of legislative directives, eligibility criteria, and administrative processes. Typically, federal assistance programs are designed to support specific demographics, such as low-income families, veterans, or individuals with disabilities, based on the objectives outlined by Congress, which oversees the creation and funding of these programs.

One key way assistance is allocated is through financial need assessments. Programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) use income thresholds relative to the federal poverty level to determine eligibility. The federal government sets broad eligibility guidelines, but state agencies administer the programs, taking into account local economic conditions to manage the distribution more effectively.

Another mechanism for allocation involves categorical eligibility. For instance, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs provides benefits specifically to individuals who have served in the military, with further criteria such as length of service and discharge status potentially affecting eligibility. Similarly, federal housing assistance targets low-income families, but certain subprograms are tailored to seniors or individuals with disabilities.

Additionally, some federal programs use block grants to allocate funds to states, which then have the discretion to tailor assistance according to local needs. For example, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program provides funding to communities to address a wide range of unique community development needs, from housing to infrastructure improvements. States and local governments often have considerable leeway in how they utilize these funds, provided they adhere to federal guidelines.

Finally, assistance can also be allocated through competitive grant processes. Various agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), offer grants to research institutions, requiring applicants to meet specific criteria and demonstrate how their projects align with the agency's goals. These grants often involve a rigorous review process that includes assessments of merit and potential impact.

In all these cases, transparency and accountability are crucial. Federal agencies are required to maintain records of how funds are allocated and spent, and these are often subject to audits and reviews to ensure compliance with both federal regulations and the intended goals of the assistance programs.",415.0,1407.0,1879,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.168330907821655,1.1830880641937256,7.49035382270813,Affirmative action,0.0

Relevant context: The Egyptian press during the era of Gamal Abdel Nasser, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, reacted to his accomplishments with varying degrees of praise, enthusiasm, and sometimes criticism, reflecting the complex political landscape of the time. 

Initially, Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956 was met with immense support and praise across Egyptian media. Major newspapers like Al-Ahram lauded the move as a bold assertion of Egyptian sovereignty and a step towards reclaiming national resources from colonial powers. Headlines celebrated Nasser as a hero who stood up to Western dominance, and editorials praised his skillful outmaneuvering of Britain and France, especially following the successful political aftermath of the Suez Crisis. 

State-controlled media outlets were particularly vocal in their support, echoing Nasser's revolutionary rhetoric and promoting the image of a strong, independent Egypt. The press highlighted his role in leading the Non-Aligned Movement and his vision for pan-Arabism, which resonated strongly with the public and was reflected in various cultural productions, including patriotic songs and popular films.

Nasser's domestic policies, such as land reforms and industrialization efforts, also received attention. State-run newspapers often highlighted the successes of these initiatives, emphasizing improvements in agriculture and infrastructure as evidence of progress under Nasser's leadership. They painted a picture of Nasser as a champion of the working class, depicting how the redistribution of land was intended to reduce the hold of powerful landlords and empower peasants.

However, during periods of economic difficulty and political unrest, some independent and international outlets took a more critical stance. They pointed out the challenges and shortcomings of Nasser's policies, including issues with bureaucracy and inefficiencies in state-run enterprises. In the aftermath of the 1967 Six-Day War, even supportive media began to express disappointment and called for introspection, though criticism was often veiled due to government censorship and the nationalization of the press.

By and large, the Egyptian press played a crucial role in shaping public perception of Nasser's accomplishments, oscillating between propagating state narratives and cautiously critiquing his administration during times of crisis. The press's reaction, therefore, serves as a complex mirror reflecting both Nasser's influence and the undercurrents of dissent in Egyptian society at the time.",482.0,1779.0,2318,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.78261923789978,1.0932025909423828,7.034833908081055,Cooperative,0.0

"There is a wide consensus that the racial categories that are common in everyday usage are socially constructed, and that racial groups cannot be biologically defined. Nonetheless, some scholars argue that racial categories obviously correlate with biological traits (e.g. phenotype) to some degree, and that certain genetic markers have varying frequencies among human populations, some of which correspond more or less to traditional racial groupings. For this reason, there is no current consensus about whether racial categories can be considered to have significance for understanding human genetic variation.",What is the majority opinion on whether racial categories can be considered to have impact on human genetic variation? ,no current consensus,0,DESC,"What is the majority opinion on whether racial categories can be considered to have impact on human genetic variation? 

Relevant context: While there has been considerable debate within scientific and academic communities regarding the impact of racial categories on human genetic variation, the majority opinion leans towards the understanding that race, as a social construct, does not directly correspond to significant differences in human genetic makeup. This perspective is informed by several key insights from genetic research and anthropology.

Firstly, numerous studies in human genetics have shown that the vast majority of genetic variation (approximately 85 to 90%) exists within so-called racial groups, rather than between them. This suggests that any genetic differences between people of different racial categories are relatively minor. The human genome project and other large-scale genetic studies have reinforced this view, demonstrating the high degree of genetic similarity among all humans. 

Anthropologists and social scientists typically argue that racial categories are primarily social, political, and historical constructs rather than scientifically valid distinctions rooted in biology. These categories often reflect superficial phenotypic traits such as skin color, which are determined by a small number of genes and are poor proxies for the complex genetic architecture of humans. Moreover, such phenotypic traits have been subject to natural selection in response to geographical and environmental factors, rather than being indicative of distinct genetic lineages.

The concept of race therefore has limited utility in predicting genetic differences, and many scientists favor the use of more specific terms like ancestry or ethnicity, which can account for both genetic and cultural factors. Geneticists often focus on ancestry informative markers that can more accurately trace lineage and population history without resorting to broad racial categories.

In summary, while race can influence social experiences and health outcomes due to socio-economic and environmental factors, the majority scientific consensus is that racial categories do not signify any meaningful or consistent genetic subdivisions within the human species. This understanding helps to combat the misconception that race has a biological basis in genetic variation, promoting a more nuanced understanding of human diversity.",393.0,1789.0,2247,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.678520679473877,1.636427402496338,7.436965227127075,No consensus,0.8
"Beginning in 1979, Nigerians participated in a brief return to democracy when Olusegun Obasanjo transferred power to the civilian regime of Shehu Shagari.

Buhari promised major reforms, but his government fared little better than its predecessor. His regime was overthrown by another military coup in 1985.",How did Nigerians view the Shagari administration?,corrupt and incompetent,0,DESC,"How did Nigerians view the Shagari administration?

Relevant context: The Shagari administration, which spanned from 1979 to 1983, remains a significant period in Nigeria's history, marked by both enthusiasm and controversy. Nigerians held varied views about President Shehu Usman Aliyu Shagari’s government, reflective of the social, economic, and political complexion of the time.

Initially, Shagari's presidency evoked a sense of hope and optimism, primarily because it marked the return to civilian rule after 13 years of military governance. Many Nigerians were eager for democratic governance, hoping it would address the nation's rising economic challenges and foster political stability. Under the banner of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN), Shagari campaigned on a platform promising to foster national unity, economic growth, and to continue with programs initiated during the military era, particularly in infrastructure and agriculture.

However, the economic landscape during Shagari’s tenure presented significant challenges. The global oil glut of the early 1980s drastically reduced Nigeria's oil revenue, which was the backbone of the economy. This economic downturn led to inflation, massive unemployment, and a staggering national debt, impacting the populace harshly. As a result, many Nigerians expressed dissatisfaction with Shagari's economic policies, particularly the austerity measures that seemed to exacerbate the hardships faced by ordinary citizens.

Politically, Shagari's administration was marred by allegations of widespread corruption and electoral malpractice, notably during the 1983 general elections. Critics argued that corruption among politicians and within government establishments became rampant, undermining public confidence in the government. The 1983 elections, which saw Shagari’s re-election, were especially controversial, with opposition parties and many observers alleging that the elections were rigged, leading to widespread unrest and disillusionment among Nigerians.

Supporters of the administration often emphasize Shagari's efforts in initiating projects aimed at bolstering the agricultural sector, particularly the Green Revolution program, which sought to increase food production for self-sufficiency.

Ultimately, the military coup of December 31, 1983, which brought Major General Muhammadu Buhari to power, highlighted the deep-seated discontent with Shagari’s administration. While some viewed the coup as an end to ineffective leadership, others feared a return to military rule would hinder Nigeria’s democratic evolution.

In sum, Nigerian perspectives on the Shagari administration were mixed, shaped largely by the economic struggles and political challenges of the era. Although Shagari had noble intentions and started his presidency on a hopeful note, his tenure is often critiqued for failing to effectively address the economic downturn and for not instituting significant anticorruption measures.

The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety. Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel, Dash.

Relevant context: In her memoir, Victoria painted a vivid picture of her childhood as both idyllic and formative, steeped in the warmth and challenges that shaped her character. She described growing up in a small village tucked away in the English countryside, a place she often referred to as a ""haven of tranquility."" Her early years were marked by the freedom to roam through vast, untamed fields and ancient woodlands, fostering a deep connection with nature that remained with her throughout her life.

Victoria fondly recalled the long summers spent exploring with her siblings, building elaborate treehouses and embarking on imaginary quests. She mentioned how her mother, a woman of boundless curiosity and creativity, encouraged her to pursue her interests with passion and tenacity. Victoria often spoke of evenings where the family would gather around the fireplace, her father regaling them with stories of his own adventures, instilling in her a love for storytelling and history.

However, Victoria also candidly addressed the challenges she faced, particularly the strict expectations placed upon her as the eldest child. She wrote about the sense of responsibility that often felt overwhelming, as she navigated the delicate balance between pursuing her own dreams and meeting her family's expectations. Despite these pressures, Victoria credited these experiences with teaching her resilience and determination.

In her reflections, Victoria conveyed a sense of gratitude for her upbringing, acknowledging both the joys and trials as integral parts of her journey.

"Reservations are essentially caveats to a state's acceptance of a treaty. Reservations are unilateral statements purporting to exclude or to modify the legal obligation and its effects on the reserving state.

Relevant context: Once a state becomes a party to a treaty through ratification, accession, or any other mode of consent as outlined in the treaty itself, it is bound to adhere to the obligations and restrictions specified in the treaty. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which serves as a fundamental framework for understanding treaty law, outlines several actions that parties to a treaty are forbidden from engaging in after joining.

First and foremost, parties are forbidden from enacting any measures that would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty. This principle applies from the moment the treaty is signed and continues to be binding upon ratification. States must ensure that their domestic laws and actions are in harmony with the treaty's objectives and not in contradiction with the commitments they have undertaken.

Moreover, parties must comply with the principle of pacta sunt servanda, which translates to ""agreements must be kept."" This tenet forbids parties from acting in a manner that would breach their treaty obligations, requiring states to perform their duties in good faith. Any deliberate action or omission that represents a breach may lead to legal consequences under international law.

States are also prohibited from withdrawing from or terminating the treaty in an arbitrary manner. The conditions under which a party may withdraw or terminate the treaty are usually elaborated within the treaty text itself. These conditions often include providing notice within a specified time frame and only under predetermined circumstances. In the absence of such provisions, the Vienna Convention stipulates that withdrawal is forbidden unless agreed upon by all parties or if it can be demonstrated that a fundamental change of circumstances has occurred, radically transforming the extent of obligations originally consented to.

In addition to these general prohibitions, treaties may include specific clauses that impose further restrictions on the parties. These can encompass prohibitions on certain types of conduct, engagements in specified economic activities, or any actions that compromise the security or interests of other member states as defined by the treaty.

In summary, by becoming a party to a treaty, states accept a range of prohibitions tailored to ensure the effectiveness and stability of international agreements.

Relevant context: The Soviets were primarily concerned with halting the spread of Western influence and ideologies, particularly capitalism and democracy, which they believed threatened the foundations of the socialist state they had built. During the Cold War, this overarching goal translated into several specific geopolitical and ideological objectives that the Soviet Union aimed to stop or contain. 

Firstly, the Soviets were committed to preventing the encroachment of NATO and Western military presence near their borders. This was particularly evident in their responses to events such as the Berlin Crisis and later, the deployment of intermediate-range nuclear forces in Europe, which they viewed as aggressive acts that could destabilize the balance of power.

In the ideological and geopolitical sphere, the Soviets were determined to thwart the spread of anti-communist regimes. They were heavily invested in supporting socialist and communist governments worldwide, from Eastern Europe to Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The Soviet intervention in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, for example, were motivated by a desire to stop the erosion of communist rule by reformist movements that threatened to veer toward capitalism or align with the West.

Additionally, the Soviets aimed to disrupt Western efforts to isolate and contain the USSR economically and politically on the global stage. This involved opposing initiatives that sought to extend Western economic systems and influence into what they considered their sphere of influence, such as Western support for anti-communist movements in third-world countries and attempts to integrate these regions into the Western-led economic order. 

Ultimately, the Soviet Union's actions were driven by a desire to preserve its own security, maintain its ideological influence, and protect its strategic interests against what it perceived as an aggressive Western bloc determined to undermine Soviet socialism and expand capitalist systems globally.",362.0,1553.0,1970,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.380880355834961,1.133850336074829,9.58169412612915,German militarism,0.0
"The ""General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples"" grants all indigenous languages spoken in Mexico, regardless of the number of speakers, the same validity as Spanish in all territories in which they are spoken, and indigenous peoples are entitled to request some public services and documents in their native languages. Along with Spanish, the law has granted them — more than 60 languages — the status of ""national languages"". The law includes all indigenous languages of the Americas regardless of origin; that is, it includes the indigenous languages of ethnic groups non-native to the territory. As such the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples recognizes the language of the Kickapoo, who immigrated from the United States, and recognizes the languages of the Guatemalan indigenous refugees. The Mexican government has promoted and established bilingual primary and secondary education in some indigenous rural communities.

Relevant context: Indigenous peoples are entitled to request a range of rights and resources that are crucial to preserving their cultural heritage, autonomy, and well-being. Under international conventions such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), they have the right to self-determination, meaning they can freely determine their political status and pursue their economic, social, and cultural development.

Indigenous communities can request the recognition and protection of their lands, territories, and resources, which are often integral to their cultural identity and way of life. This includes the right to own, use, develop, and control these lands. They are also entitled to seek the restoration and protection of their traditional knowledge and cultural expressions, ensuring that their cultural heritage is preserved and shared according to their own customs and preferences.

Furthermore, indigenous peoples can request access to education and healthcare services that are culturally appropriate and responsive to their specific needs. They have the right to participate in decision-making processes that affect them, ensuring their voices are heard in matters such as environmental protection, resource management, and economic development initiatives.

In addition to these rights, indigenous peoples can seek reparations and redress for historical injustices and violations of their human rights.

Negrito means ""little black people"" in Spanish (negrito is the Spanish diminutive of negro, i.e., ""little black person""); it is what the Spaniards called the short-statured, hunter-gatherer autochthones that they encountered in the Philippines. Despite this, Negritos are never referred to as black today, and doing so would cause offense.

The common Thai word for Negritos literally means ""frizzy hair"".",What language does the term Negrito come from?,Spanish,0,DESC,"What language does the term Negrito come from?

Relevant context: The term ""Negrito"" finds its origins in the Spanish language. It is a diminutive form of the Spanish word ""negro,"" which means ""black."" In Spanish, adding the diminutive suffix ""-ito"" implies a smaller size or a term of endearment; hence ""Negrito"" translates to ""little black person"" or ""small black one."" The term was historically used by Spanish explorers and colonizers to describe various indigenous peoples in regions of Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines, the Andaman Islands, and parts of Malaysia, who they encountered and noted for their darker skin and smaller stature compared to other groups in those regions. ""Negrito"" is not a single ethnic group but rather a classification that refers to several distinct ethnic groups that share certain physical characteristics like dark skin and short stature. Today, the term can be considered sensitive or outdated; therefore, it's often used in specific academic contexts pertaining to anthropology or history. It's important to recognize the individual identities and cultures of the groups traditionally labeled as ""Negrito,"" such as the Aeta, Maniq, and Onge peoples, among others.

Egypt experienced a ""golden age"" of culture during Nasser's presidency, according to historian Joel Gordon, particularly in film, television, theater, radio, literature, fine arts, comedy, poetry, and music. Egypt under Nasser dominated the Arab world in these fields, producing cultural icons.",How was Egyptian culture under Nasser refered to?,golden age,0,DESC,"How was Egyptian culture under Nasser refered to?

Relevant context: During the era of Gamal Abdel Nasser, who served as the President of Egypt from 1956 to 1970, Egyptian culture experienced a significant transformation that has often been referred to as the ""Nasserite cultural renaissance."" This period was marked by a strong emphasis on Arab nationalism, socialist ideals, and a focus on modernizing society while retaining key cultural identities. 

Nasser's cultural policies were influenced by his broader socio-political objectives, which aimed at establishing a unified Arab identity and reducing foreign influence that had permeated Egypt over centuries. One of the major hallmarks of the Nasser era was the nationalization of the press and media, including the film industry, radio, and publishing houses, to ensure they aligned with state ideology. The government used these platforms to disseminate nationalist propaganda, celebrate Egyptian history, and promote cultural achievements.

The establishment of the Ministry of Culture in 1958 marked a pivotal point during Nasser's rule. The Ministry sought to democratize culture by making it accessible to the masses rather than just the urban elite. Initiatives included the spread of cultural palaces and community cultural centers across the country, making literature, theater, and the arts available to a broader audience.

Moreover, literature and cinema flourished during this period, with storytellers and filmmakers portraying narratives that resonated with Nasser's ideological themes, such as social justice, resistance against imperialism, and the struggles of the working class. Iconic films of the time often highlighted these themes, and they played a role in shaping the national consciousness. Notable literary figures like Naguib Mahfouz, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1988, produced works that captured the nuance and complexity of Egyptian society under Nasser.

The Nasser regime also placed a significant emphasis on education as a critical factor in cultural development. The expansion of educational opportunities was designed to foster a generation that could contribute to Egypt's goals for modernization and progress. This era witnessed an increase in literacy rates and educational reforms that promoted both scientific and humanistic disciplines.

In conclusion, Egyptian culture under Nasser was referred to as a period of rejuvenation and transformation, inspired by the president's vision for an independent and modern Arab world. It was a time characterized by the promotion of nationalistic themes, the expansion of cultural access, and a balancing act between embracing modernization and remaining rooted in traditional cultural values.

"Translation of a text that is sung in vocal music for the purpose of singing in another language—sometimes called ""singing translation""—is closely linked to translation of poetry because most vocal music, at least in the Western tradition, is set to verse, especially verse in regular patterns with rhyme. (Since the late 19th century, musical setting of prose and free verse has also been practiced in some art music, though popular music tends to remain conservative in its retention of stanzaic forms with or without refrains.) A rudimentary example of translating poetry for singing is church hymns, such as the German chorales translated into English by Catherine Winkworth.",What is the translation of text that is sung closely linked to?,poetry,0,DESC,"What is the translation of text that is sung closely linked to?

Relevant context: The translation of text that is sung is closely linked to the fields of musicology, linguistics, and cultural studies. This type of translation involves a unique set of challenges because it must not only convey the literal meaning of the original lyrics, but also preserve the musicality, rhythm, and emotional tone of the song. 

One significant aspect is the importance of maintaining the phonetic fit, where the translated lyrics need to align with the melody's structure. This can often mean that translators must prioritize syllable count and stress patterns over a direct word-for-word translation. Additionally, cultural context plays a crucial role; translators must ensure that cultural references and idiomatic expressions in the original text are adapted in ways that resonate with the target audience while respecting the original message.

Moreover, the translation of sung text often involves collaboration between translators and musicians to achieve a seamless blend of lyrical meaning and musical expression. This collaboration is essential to determine whether adjustments to the melody or accompaniment are necessary to accommodate the new lyrics without losing the essence of the song.

In practice, this process results in translations that might differ significantly from the source text, yet capture the same spirit and emotional impact. For instance, the translation of popular songs for international audiences often leads to variations that reflect different themes or emphasize emotional core rather than literal details, ensuring the song's appeal remains intact despite linguistic barriers.

Overall, the translation of sung text is a multifaceted endeavor that intersects language, music, and culture, requiring a creative approach beyond traditional translation methods.",317.0,1255.0,1630,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,3.5904393196105957,1.0365591049194336,5.534175872802734,Poetry,1.0

Still referring to copyright, he cites legal literature such as the United States Constitution and case law to demonstrate that it is meant to be an optional and experimental bargain that temporarily trades property rights and free speech for public, not private, benefit in the form of increased artistic production and knowledge.

Relevant context: In a discussion about the evolution of software development practices, Richard Stallman, a staunch advocate for free software and founder of the Free Software Foundation, has often spoken about certain aspects of software design and features that should remain flexible and open to exploration. Specifically, Stallman has expressed his viewpoint that the inclusion of proprietary components, often seen in the world of software development, was originally meant to be optional and experimental.

Stallman argues that when the software industry began incorporating non-free elements—those components that restrict user freedom and control—it was initially intended as a trial approach, not a permanent fixture. These components were supposed to allow developers to explore the potential benefits of proprietary add-ons without fully committing to them as a norm. Stallman's perspective is that by making these components optional, developers and users could assess their true utility and impact on software freedom. This experimental approach was supposed to foster innovation and growth, without compromising the ethical and philosophical foundation of software freedom.

However, over time, Stallman believes that these proprietary components became entrenched in software ecosystems, shifting from being experimental options to default practices. In his view, this shift is problematic because it detracts from the core principles of free software, which prioritize user autonomy and the ability to modify and share software freely.

Stallman's emphasis on keeping proprietary components optional and experimental reflects his broader vision for software development, where freedom and flexibility are paramount. He continues to advocate for this understanding within the software community, urging developers and companies to reconsider the permanence of proprietary elements in their products and to remain open to the ideals of free software as originally envisioned.",336.0,1415.0,1808,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,5.482349634170532,1.2610132694244385,8.009170293807983,Copyright,1.0
"Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area.

All three of these peoples, as well as other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.",What epidemic resulted in numerous deaths between the 1830s and 1860s?,smallpox,0,DESC,"What epidemic resulted in numerous deaths between the 1830s and 1860s?

Relevant context: Between the 1830s and 1860s, the world experienced several devastating outbreaks of cholera, an epidemic that resulted in numerous deaths across Europe, Asia, and North America. Known as the second cholera pandemic, this wave began in India in 1829. By 1830, the disease had spread rapidly through trade routes to countries in Asia and Europe, reaching Moscow by 1830 and spreading across Europe to Berlin, Paris, and London by the early 1830s. North America reported cholera cases by 1832.

Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae and spreads through contaminated water and food, leading to severe dehydration due to vomiting and diarrhea. During the 19th-century outbreaks, medical understanding of the disease was still limited, and sanitary conditions in rapidly urbanizing areas contributed significantly to the spread of the infection. Cities with growing populations often lacked proper sewage systems, which facilitated the transmission of the disease through contaminated water supplies.

The pandemic claimed hundreds of thousands of lives globally, with notable outbreaks in crowded urban areas. For example, Hamburg suffered heavy casualties as the disease spread rapidly through its port city environment. In the United States, the influx of immigrants and the movement of troops during the Mexican-American War created conditions ripe for the spread of cholera throughout New York, New Orleans, and into the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys.

The epidemic highlighted the urgent need for public health reforms. In response, cities began to invest more in sanitation infrastructure, leading to the construction of sewage systems and cleaner water supplies. Prominent figures, such as Dr. John Snow in London, contributed to understanding cholera's transmission by identifying contaminated water sources as the primary mode of spread, which paved the way for improvements in public health policies and practices.

The cholera epidemics between the 1830s and 1860s were pivotal in shaping modern epidemiology and public health responses, as they underscored the importance of sanitation, clean water supplies, and rapid response measures in controlling infectious diseases.",431.0,1826.0,2320,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.32328462600708,1.189542531967163,6.673330545425415,Cholera,0.0

They proposed that intentionality extends beyond the simple desire to inflict physical harm. Instead, they argued that the intention of the perpetrator often encompasses a broader, more strategic goal. Specifically, Chalk and Jonassohn emphasized that perpetrators frequently aim not only to eliminate individual members of a targeted group but to irrevocably dismantle the social fabric and cultural identity of the group as a whole. This intention is not merely a matter of immediate physical destruction but resonates through attempts to decimate the group's connections, autonomy, and continuity. Integral to their definition is the recognition that perpetrator intention involves both immediate and long-term objectives, often manifesting as systematic policies or actions designed to eradicate the existence and influence of the targeted group within society. Through this perspective, Chalk and Jonassohn underscore the multifaceted nature of intent, highlighting that it is deeply tied to the overarching goals of power consolidation, ideological dominance, or cultural homogenization.

Relevant context: The Shia tariqahs, or spiritual paths within Islam, belong to the broader Shia branch of Islam, which is one of the two main sects, alongside Sunni Islam. The term ""tariqah"" itself generally refers to a Sufi order or spiritual path, and within Shia Islam, certain tariqahs have developed that emphasize Shia beliefs and practices.

Shia Islam primarily recognizes the leadership of the Prophet Muhammad's family, known as the Ahl al-Bayt, and particularly the line of Imams starting with Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet. One of the most prominent Shia tariqahs is the Nimatullahi order, which follows mystical practices closely in line with Shia teachings and places particular emphasis on the spiritual guidance of the Imam.

Another notable Shia tariqah is the Safavid tariqah, which played a significant role in the establishment of the Safavid dynasty in Iran and the eventual declaration of Twelver Shia Islam as the state religion. This tariqah integrated Shia theological principles with Sufi mysticism, contributing to a unique blend of spiritual practices.

The Shia tariqahs align with the Shia beliefs in the infallibility and spiritual authority of the Imams, distinguishing them from Sunni tariqahs, which may not necessarily emphasize the Imamate. While both Shia and Sunni tariqahs focus on personal spiritual development and the inward journey of the soul, Shia tariqahs particularly highlight the guiding light of the Imams in this journey.

Overall, Shia tariqahs form a subset of the larger Shia Islamic tradition, contributing to its rich spiritual heritage while maintaining a unique Sufi character closely tied to Shia doctrine.

In traditional Japanese naming conventions, ""Saburo"" usually signifies the ""third son,"" combining ""sabu"" (三), meaning ""three,"" with ""ro"" (郎), a suffix meaning ""son"" or ""boy."" This is one of the numeral names traditionally given to sons based on their birth order within a family.

However, if we are looking at Saburo in a specific narrative, literary work, or cultural context, the meaning might extend beyond its literal translation. For instance, a character named Saburo in literature could symbolize specific traits such as loyalty, as third sons historically could be seen as reliable supporters in familial and feudal order. 

Moreover, if Saburo is considered within Japanese folklore or historical anecdotes, it could refer to famous figures or characters like ""Kaidomaru,"" later known as ""Kintaro,"" whose childhood name was Saburo Ushiwakamaru. In such contexts, the name might carry connotations of bravery or heroism.

To effectively determine what Saburo could mean in your specific context, consider the source material or background in which Saburo is mentioned. Is it within a family-based narrative, a historical recount, or a literary piece with cultural significance? Understanding this will guide you to interpret whether its meaning adheres strictly to birth order or takes on symbolic connotations according to the story or character's role.",341.0,1784.0,2176,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.008042335510254,1.1167826652526855,6.256824731826782,Formal nickname,0.8
"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that ""losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah."" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]",What is the strongest form of discipline the Jehovah Witnesses' judicial committee can render?,Disfellowshipping,0,DESC,"What is the strongest form of discipline the Jehovah Witnesses' judicial committee can render?

Relevant context: In the community of Jehovah's Witnesses, maintaining moral and spiritual order is of utmost importance. Central to this is the role of the judicial committee, a body within the congregation tasked with addressing violations of the organization's teachings and standards. The strongest form of discipline that this committee can render is known as ""disfellowshipping.""

Disfellowshipping is a practice whereby a member of the congregation is formally removed from the community due to actions deemed to be in serious contravention of the principles outlined in the Bible, as interpreted by Jehovah's Witnesses. This measure is considered necessary when a member engages in conduct that could potentially harm the spiritual well-being of the congregation or undermine its moral foundation. Examples of such conduct might include persistent immoral behavior, apostasy, or unrepentant sinful actions.

The process leading to disfellowshipping typically involves a series of steps. Initially, a judicial committee is formed, usually consisting of three elders who investigate the alleged misconduct. The individual in question is invited to a confidential meeting where they can present their side of the story and demonstrate any signs of repentance. If the committee concludes that the individual's actions are serious and they are not repentant, disfellowshipping is decided upon.

Once someone is disfellowshipped, they are effectively cut off from the congregation and social interactions with its members drastically change. Jehovah's Witnesses are encouraged to shun the disfellowshipped individual, meaning they do not engage in regular social contact or fellowship. This period of separation is intended to serve as a strong corrective measure, encouraging the individual to reconsider their actions and seek reinstatement by returning to the path of repentance.

Reinstatement is possible after a period of time during which the disfellowshipped person is expected to demonstrate genuine repentance and a change in behavior. Upon their request, a new judicial committee meeting may be convened to assess their sincerity and determine whether they can be readmitted into the congregation.

Disfellowshipping is a serious step that reflects the Jehovah's Witnesses' commitment to upholding their understanding of Biblical teachings and fostering a closely knit spiritual community. It is considered a last resort, used only when all other efforts to encourage a member to comply with community standards have failed.",466.0,1815.0,2345,1.0,1.0,1.0,12.573652029037476,1.1785485744476318,14.906128644943237,Disfellowshipping,1.0
"Besides slaves, there were a number of free people of color in the state. Most were descended from free African Americans who had migrated along with neighbors from Virginia during the 18th century. The majority were the descendants of unions in the working classes between white women, indentured servants or free, and African men, indentured, slave or free. After the Revolution, Quakers and Mennonites worked to persuade slaveholders to free their slaves. Some were inspired by their efforts and the language of the Revolution to arrange for manumission of their slaves. The number of free people of color rose markedly in the first couple of decades after the Revolution.",After the revolution Quakers and mennonited encouraged slaveholders to do what?,free their slaves,0,DESC,"After the revolution Quakers and mennonited encouraged slaveholders to do what?

Relevant context: After the American Revolution, Quakers and Mennonites played a significant role in encouraging slaveholders to emancipate their enslaved people. Both religious groups were deeply rooted in principles of pacifism, equality, and social justice, which fundamentally opposed the institution of slavery.

Quakers, in particular, were at the forefront of the abolitionist movement. As early as the late 17th century, they began to express their opposition to slavery. By the 18th century, Quakers had formalized their stance through various meetings and declarations. Their goal after the revolution was to leverage the new sentiments of freedom and liberty that had been catalyzed by the American Revolution to push for the emancipation of enslaved people.

The Society of Friends, as the Quakers are formally known, took concrete steps to promote this cause. They established committees to educate slaveholders on the immorality and inhumanity of slavery, appealing to their consciences and religious convictions. Meetings were held where slaveholders were encouraged not only to set their enslaved people free but also to improve the conditions for those who were not yet emancipated.

Similarly, the Mennonites, while less vocal in the public sphere compared to the Quakers, held strong convictions against slavery. They too encouraged manumission—freeing enslaved individuals—through personal interactions, letters, and the moral influence of their communities. Mennonites focused on setting an example through their own practices, as they were insistent on living lives that reflected their religious beliefs of peace and brotherhood.

During this time, the writings and speeches of prominent abolitionist figures inspired by or associated with these groups helped to sway public opinion. Many Quakers and Mennonites pursued legislative change and supported individuals and organizations that advocated for abolition, including efforts to aid those escaping slavery via networks like the Underground Railroad later in the 19th century.

In summary, after the revolution, Quakers and Mennonites encouraged slaveholders to acknowledge the cruelty of slavery and to act in accordance with the newfound American ideals of liberty and justice by liberating those they enslaved. This push for emancipation reflected a broader movement toward the eventual abolition of slavery in the United States.",461.0,1773.0,2296,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.969829797744751,1.1640584468841553,7.44677734375,Free their slaves,1.0

Relevant context: While CNN has not explicitly stated the reasons they believe George W. Bush was accepted into Yale, several commonly recognized factors can be considered based on historical context and available information. George W. Bush was admitted to Yale University in 1964, during a period when legacy admissions—preferences given to applicants with familial ties to the institution—were a well-established practice. 

George W. Bush is the son of George H. W. Bush, who was also a Yale alumnus, graduating in 1948. The Bush family has a longstanding history with Yale, which likely contributed to the university's favorable view of his application. In addition to legacy status, socio-economic privilege could have played a role, as the Bush family was influential and well-connected, offering advantages in networking and educational opportunities from an early age.

Further, George W. Bush attended Phillips Academy, a prestigious preparatory school known for its rigorous academic curriculum and its own history of preparing students for Ivy League universities. Admission to such a school is often a stepping stone to higher education at an elite college or university.

While these factors are speculative, they align with patterns commonly seen in admissions strategies at historic educational institutions during that period. It is important to note that the exact criteria and deliberations of the Yale admissions committee for Bush's application remain confidential. Nonetheless, understanding these contextual elements sheds light on the multidimensional nature of college admissions at that time, especially for prominent families like the Bushes.",307.0,2504.0,2871,1.0,1.0,1.0,55.53541350364685,0.9653770923614502,57.563493728637695,Preferential admissions policies,0.5

Relevant context: In the early 19th century, as Napoleon Bonaparte solidified his power as the leader of France, he recognized the need to establish a stable relationship with the Catholic Church, which had been significantly strained during the revolutionary period. The agreement that he negotiated with the Catholic Church is known as the ""Concordat of 1801."" This concordat was formally signed on July 15, 1801, by representatives of both the French government and the Papal states, including Napoleon's chief representative, Joseph Bonaparte, and the Papal representative, Cardinal Ercole Consalvi.

The Concordat of 1801 played a crucial role in re-establishing the Catholic Church in France after the chaos of the French Revolution, during which the Church had been suppressed and the influence of religious organizations had been greatly diminished. Through this agreement, the Catholic Church was recognized once again as the religion of the majority of French citizens, though not as the state religion, preserving the secular principles that had been established. 

Furthermore, the Concordat allowed Napoleon to gain a significant degree of control over the Church within France. While the papacy agreed to recognize the changes that had come with the revolution, including the reduction in the Church's land holdings, Napoleon in exchange pledged to restore some traditional privileges to the Church. Notably, this included allowing the French government to appoint bishops, who would then have to be confirmed by the pope. Clergy were to receive salaries from the state, effectively making them dependent on the government.

"Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human being. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call ""humane"" or ""polite"" learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia. Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance, and, in fifteenth-century Italy, teachers and scholars of philosophy, poetry, and rhetoric were called and called themselves ""humanists"". Modern scholars, however, point out that Cicero (106 – 43 BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas, in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law.

Relevant context: The Four Immeasurable Minds, also known as the Four Immeasurables, the Four Sublime Attitudes, or the Brahmaviharas, are a set of qualities or states of mind that are central to Buddhist practice. They are considered to be boundless or limitless, transcending all limitations of the individual self, and are intended to cultivate a profound sense of compassion and empathy towards all living beings. These four qualities are:

1. **Loving-kindness (Metta):** This is the wish for the happiness and well-being of all beings. It involves developing an unconditional love and goodwill towards oneself and others, free from attachment or desire.

2. **Compassion (Karuna):** This is the empathetic wish to relieve the suffering of others. It involves recognizing the suffering of others and having a profound desire to alleviate it.

3. **Sympathetic Joy (Mudita):** This is the feeling of joy in the happiness and success of others. It involves rejoicing in others’ good fortune without jealousy or envy.

4. **Equanimity (Upekkha):** This is a balanced, even-minded state characterized by calm and composure, especially in the face of life's ups and downs. It involves a sense of impartiality and non-attachment, seeing beyond biases and judgements.

The Four Immeasurables are often cultivated through meditation practices aimed at expanding these attitudes towards oneself and progressively extending them outward to encompass all beings.

In the last century of the Republic, Epicurean and particularly Stoic interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite, most of whom held - or had held - high office and traditional Roman priesthoods; notably, Scaevola and the polymath Varro. For Varro - well versed in Euhemerus' theory - popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction; what the people believed was not itself the truth, but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with. Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives, the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals, and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult.",What theory claims that popular belief was based on fiction?,Euhemerus' theory,0,ENTY,"What theory claims that popular belief was based on fiction?

Relevant context: The theory that popular belief is often based on fiction is primarily associated with the study of myth, folklore, and cultural narratives. One prominent example is the ""myth as proto-science"" theory, which suggests that many societal beliefs and practices originally arise from mythological narratives that attempt to explain the world. This theory posits that before the development of modern scientific methods, cultures worldwide developed myths—stories involving gods, heroes, and fantastical events—to make sense of natural phenomena and human existence. These myths, although based on fictional accounts, became deeply ingrained in cultural consciousness and influenced societal norms and values.

One of the early pioneers in this field was the 19th-century anthropologist Sir James Frazer, who in his work ""The Golden Bough"" argued that myths were primitive attempts to understand the environment and control it through ritual. Frazer asserted that many cultural beliefs were rooted in fictional stories that were interpreted as literal truths by ancient societies.

Furthermore, the theory of ""social construction,"" which emerged in the mid-20th century, also explores how societies create and perpetuate beliefs based on non-factual narratives. Sociologist Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann, in their seminal work ""The Social Construction of Reality,"" argued that our understanding of reality is constructed through social interactions and cultural practices, including language and storytelling. This theory posits that what people often accept as truth may actually be constructed from widespread but fictional narratives that have been normalized over time.

Additionally, the postmodern literary theory, particularly the work of Jean Baudrillard, introduces the concept of ""simulacra and simulation,"" where copies of narratives and representations become indistinguishable from reality itself. Baudrillard contends that in postmodern societies, fiction and reality blur together so thoroughly that fictional narratives not only influence beliefs but can also replace the perception of reality.

These theories collectively provide a framework for understanding how fictional narratives can shape and sustain popular beliefs, often becoming indistinguishable from what societies consider as truth. They demonstrate the powerful role storytelling plays in the formation of cultural norms and individual worldviews, emphasizing the interplay between fact and fiction in human cognition and social structures.",448.0,1932.0,2436,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.211674213409424,0.9698541164398193,19.133463621139526,Myth,0.0

"Judging by the historical records, by approximately 1000 AD the predominant ethnic group over much of modern European Russia, Ukraine and Belarus was the Eastern branch of the Slavs, speaking a closely related group of dialects. The political unification of this region into Kievan Rus' in about 880, from which modern Russia, Ukraine and Belarus trace their origins, established Old East Slavic as a literary and commercial language. It was soon followed by the adoption of Christianity in 988 and the introduction of the South Slavic Old Church Slavonic as the liturgical and official language. Borrowings and calques from Byzantine Greek began to enter the Old East Slavic and spoken dialects at this time, which in their turn modified the Old Church Slavonic as well.",What was the main language in Kievan Rus'?,Old East Slavic,0,ENTY,"What was the main language in Kievan Rus'?

Relevant context: During the period of Kievan Rus', which spanned from approximately the late 9th century to the mid-13th century, Old East Slavic was the predominant language spoken across the various territories that constituted this medieval state. Kievan Rus' was a loose federation of East Slavic and Finnic peoples under the rule of the Varangians and their descendants, with its political center in Kyiv (modern-day Kyiv, Ukraine).

Old East Slavic served as the common vernacular among the diverse Slavic tribes of the region, functioning not only as a spoken language but also as the primary language used in written documents and religious texts. This language developed from the Proto-Slavic language, which was shared by all Slavic peoples before the divergence into the distinct language branches we recognize today, such as Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian.

The influence of Old East Slavic extended to the legal and administrative realms. Legal codes such as the Russkaya Pravda, the principal legal code of Kievan Rus', were composed in Old East Slavic. Furthermore, the spread of Christianity, which escalated after the Baptism of Rus' in 988 under Prince Vladimir the Great, led to the translation of many Byzantine religious texts into Old Church Slavonic. While Old Church Slavonic, a liturgical language derived from Old Bulgarian, was used primarily in ecclesiastical contexts, its introduction further influenced the development of Old East Slavic by introducing new vocabulary and styles of writing.

The language, however, was not static throughout the period. Regional variations began to emerge as the political and cultural centers of Rus' evolved and shifted over time, contributing to the linguistic differentiation that would eventually lead to the rise of distinct East Slavic languages. Despite these changes, Old East Slavic remained the unifying linguistic medium of Kievan Rus' until the fragmentation of the state and the subsequent domination by foreign powers in the 13th century. This fragmentation marked the beginning of significant linguistic diversification, eventually culminating in the development of the modern Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian languages.",433.0,1973.0,2465,1.0,1.0,1.0,44.19393515586853,1.07895827293396,46.2760112285614,Old East Slavic,1.0

Relevant context: In the world of ornithology, when one speaks of ""cardinals,"" they are typically referring to the birds belonging to the family Cardinalidae. This family is renowned for its vibrant plumage and diverse range of species. The taxonomic rank that contains the most cardinals is the ""genus"" rank, specifically the genus *Cardinalis*. 

The genus *Cardinalis* includes several species, the most famous of which is the Northern Cardinal (*Cardinalis cardinalis*). This species is easily recognized by its striking red plumage and the distinctive crest on the male's head.

"It was not until the end of the eighteenth century that migration as an explanation for the winter disappearance of birds from northern climes was accepted. Thomas Bewick's A History of British Birds (Volume 1, 1797) mentions a report from ""a very intelligent master of a vessel"" who, ""between the islands of Minorca and Majorca, saw great numbers of Swallows flying northward"", and states the situation in Britain as follows:",Which directions were the Swallows flying?,northward,0,ENTY,"Which directions were the Swallows flying?

Relevant context: The swallows, small agile birds characterized by their swift, darting flight, were observed flying predominantly in a southwesterly direction. This behavior is typical as they embark on their migratory journey towards warmer climates. During this particular time of year, many swallows begin their long flight from the northern regions of Europe, heading towards the richer feeding grounds and milder winter temperatures found in Africa or southern Europe.

In the early morning light, their movements were meticulously organized, with large flocks sweeping across the sky at high altitudes. The birds followed natural landmarks and wind patterns, which helped to conserve their energy over such long distances. Observers noted that the swallows occasionally descended to lower altitudes during their migration to feed on insects or to rest briefly in wooded groves or along riverbanks.

The southwesterly direction noted aligns with known migratory pathways where swallows exploit favorable winds to aid their passage. As the sun began to set, the swallows could still be seen in the fading light, continuing their relentless journey, silhouetted against the vibrant hues of the evening sky.

Such directional flying is crucial for their survival, ensuring that they reach their destination with enough time to settle and prepare for the breeding season ahead.

"Following the Protestant Reformation, promoted by local reformer Martin Bucer, the principle of cuius regio, eius religio led to a certain amount of religious diversity in the highlands of northern Alsace. Landowners, who as ""local lords"" had the right to decide which religion was allowed on their land, were eager to entice populations from the more attractive lowlands to settle and develop their property. Many accepted without discrimination Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists, Jews and Anabaptists. Multiconfessional villages appeared, particularly in the region of Alsace bossue. Alsace became one of the French regions boasting a thriving Jewish community, and the only region with a noticeable Anabaptist population. The schism of the Amish under the lead of Jacob Amman from the Mennonites occurred in 1693 in Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines. The strongly Catholic Louis XIV tried in vain to drive them from Alsace. When Napoleon imposed military conscription without religious exception, most emigrated to the American continent.",Which groups or religions were greatly accepted in Alsace?,"Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists, Jews and Anabaptists",0,ENTY,"Which groups or religions were greatly accepted in Alsace?

Relevant context: Alsace, a region situated in the northeastern part of modern-day France, has a rich and complex history concerning the acceptance of diverse religious and cultural groups. Over the centuries, various factors, including geopolitical shifts, economic development, and sociocultural dynamics, influenced which groups received acceptance in the region.

During the medieval period, Alsace was predominantly influenced by the Holy Roman Empire, and Catholicism was the leading religion. However, with the onset of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, Alsace became a region of significant religious diversity. Lutheranism spread rapidly, particularly in cities such as Strasbourg, which became a notable center for Protestant thought. This introduction of Protestantism was quite widely accepted due to the influence of influential reformers and the political structures supporting religious reform.

In the 17th century, the region's religious landscape shifted once again due to the Thirty Years' War and the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Alsace became part of France, and Catholicism was reinstated as the dominant religion. Nevertheless, this transition did not completely suppress Protestant communities. Because the Treaty of Westphalia afforded certain rights to Protestant German states, Alsace managed to retain a level of religious tolerance for Lutherans, leading to a relatively peaceful coexistence of Catholics and Protestants compared to other parts of Europe during this time.

Furthermore, in the 18th and early 19th centuries, Alsace saw the rise of Judaism in its rural communities. Jewish people, who faced significant persecution in other regions, found a level of acceptance in Alsace. They contributed to the economic life as merchants and traders, particularly known for involvement in textiles and agriculture. This presence grew substantially following the French Revolution and the subsequent emancipation of Jews, which allowed for greater integration into civic life.

In modern times, Alsace has continued to be distinguished by its multicultural ethos. The region, now firmly French yet retaining strong German cultural influences, prides itself on tolerance and acceptance of various religious groups. Today, Alsace maintains Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish communities, each contributing to the distinct cultural tapestry of the area. The presence of newer religious groups such as Muslims has also become increasingly more visible due to migration patterns and the broader trend of globalization.

Through its history of shifting sovereignties and evolving policies of religious tolerance, Alsace illustrates a complex but fascinating case of cultural and religious acceptance that is shaped by both historical legacies and modern influences.",507.0,2000.0,2576,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.391155958175659,3.441927194595337,8.858195543289185,"Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists, Jews, Anabaptists",1.0

Relevant context: Traditionally, Somali wealth was primarily comprised of livestock. This reflects the pastoralist lifestyle that has been central to Somali culture and economy for centuries. The arid and semi-arid lands of Somalia are well-suited to raising animals such as camels, goats, sheep, and cattle, which have historically formed the backbone of the Somali economy. Among these, camels hold a particularly significant status. 

Camels are more than just a source of wealth; they are also highly valued for their adaptability to harsh climates, which makes them indispensable for transportation and as a source of milk and, less frequently, meat. Owning a large number of camels is considered a symbol of prosperity and social status in many Somali communities. In addition to camels, goats and sheep are crucial as they provide milk, meat, and hides, which can be used domestically or traded. These animals not only represent wealth but also play a vital role in trade networks, as livestock products are traded locally and regionally.

Beyond livestock, Somali wealth traditionally included handmade crafts and trade. Historically, the coastal location of Somalia facilitated trade with the Arab world, Persia, India, and later Europe, bringing additional goods and wealth into Somali society.

Relevant context: Frederic Remington, an iconic American artist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, is best known for his vivid and dynamic depictions of the American West. His paintings frequently featured scenes of frontier life, capturing the essence of the rugged and often romanticized landscapes and characters that defined the period. Central to Remington's work were images of cowboys, cavalry soldiers, Native Americans, and frontiersmen, all set against the backdrop of expansive plains, rugged mountains, and vast skies.

Remington's fascination with the American West was both artistic and personal. He traveled extensively throughout the region, gathering material and inspiration for his work. His paintings often depicted the challenges and adventures of life on the frontier. Cowboys riding through dusty trails, herding cattle in sprawling deserts, or engaging in dramatic gunfights and pursuits were common subjects. Equally, he captured scenes of U.S. Cavalry soldiers on horseback, patrolling the borderlands or interacting with various Native American tribes.

Native Americans themselves were a frequent subject in Remington's work. He sought to portray them with a sense of authenticity and respect, often focusing on their traditional clothing, lively dances, and everyday activities. His paintings reflected a keen interest in the culture and customs of the Plains Indians, although his depictions sometimes carried the biases and stereotypes of his time.

Moreover, Remington's art extended to the portrayal of the natural environment. His love for the wild landscapes of the West is evident in his work, where he juxtaposed the vast, untamed wilderness with the human drama unfolding within it. Remington's rich use of color and meticulous attention to detail helped convey the harsh beauty of the Western terrain, making his paintings resonate with a sense of adventure and nostalgia for a vanishing way of life.

Relevant context: Anti-Masonic arguments among Muslims often center on a range of religious, political, and social concerns, grounded in both historical and modern contexts. One primary argument asserts that Freemasonry is incompatible with Islamic beliefs and practices. Critics argue that the rituals and oaths required by Freemasonry can conflict with the tenets of Islam, which emphasize monotheism, and submission solely to Allah. For many Muslims, the secrecy that shrouds Masonic activities raises suspicions, leading to the belief that its principles may contradict the openness and communal focus inherent in Islamic tradition.

Politically, some anti-Masonic Muslims view Freemasonry as an imperialistic and colonialist force, historically associated with Western powers. This perspective is often fueled by conspiracy theories suggesting that Masonic groups have exerted undue influence over world events to the detriment of Muslim-majority nations. Critics argue that Freemasonry promotes a secular, globalist agenda that undermines Islamic governance and societal structures. The idea that Freemasonry supports a New World Order—a concept tied to the unification of religion, economy, and politics—is seen by some as a threat to the cultural and religious identity of Muslim communities.

Socially and culturally, Freemasonry is sometimes perceived as a Western import that could erode traditional Islamic values. Anti-Masonic narratives often highlight concerns over moral and ethical corruption, positing that Freemasonry’s supposed promotion of universalism and relativism can weaken the moral fabric of Islamic societies. These arguments are supported by claims suggesting that members of Masonic lodges hold significant positions within cultural and educational institutions, potentially leading to a dilution or marginalization of Islamic teachings.

Lastly, historical documents and fatwas issued by some Islamic scholars have reinforced these positions, declaring Freemasonry to be incompatible with Islam and urging Muslims to avoid any involvement with Masonic organizations. While these views do not represent all Muslims, they encapsulate the central themes around which anti-Masonic arguments within the Muslim community often revolve.

Relevant context: Steven Spielberg, the renowned American filmmaker, faced bullying during his childhood largely due to his religious background. Born to a Jewish family, Spielberg grew up in various towns across Arizona and California, often finding himself in environments where he was part of a small minority. His Jewish identity became a target for bullies at a young age, which left a lasting impact on him.

In interviews, Spielberg has recounted how he was taunted with anti-Semitic slurs and how these experiences of being ostracized and marginalized for his heritage profoundly affected his self-esteem and childhood experiences. These formative experiences not only contributed to his feelings of alienation but also later influenced some of the themes in his films, where he often explores issues of identity, exclusion, and the struggle to belong.

Moreover, Spielberg’s interest in filmmaking also set him apart from his peers, which could have added to his feeling of being different. As a young boy, he devoted a considerable amount of time to creating short films with his family's Super 8 camera, a passion that might have been misunderstood by his classmates, further isolating him. However, despite the challenges he faced, Spielberg was able to channel these early experiences into his art, eventually becoming one of the most successful and influential directors in Hollywood.

Relevant context: The process that acknowledges sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church is called canonization. Canonization is a complex and multi-step procedure that involves a thorough investigation of the candidate's life, virtues, and alleged miracles. It is overseen by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, a department of the Vatican responsible for managing the process. The key steps in the canonization process include:

1. **Servant of God**: The process begins when a person's local bishop opens an investigation into the individual's life. This usually happens five years after the candidate's death, although the Pope can waive this waiting period. The candidate is then referred to as a ""Servant of God.""

2. **Venerable**: If the initial investigation finds that the individual lived a life of heroic virtue, the case is sent to the Vatican for further examination. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints reviews the case and, if approved, the Pope may declare the person ""Venerable,"" recognizing their extraordinary virtue.

3. **Beatification**: To proceed to beatification, a miracle attributed to the candidate's intercession must be verified, typically involving a medically inexplicable recovery. Once confirmed, the individual is declared ""Blessed,"" and may be venerated by a specific group or region.

4. **Canonization**: For canonization, a second miracle is usually required (although different rules apply for martyrs). Upon verification, the Pope canonizes the individual, officially declaring them a ""Saint."" Saints are universally venerated within the Church, and their feast days may be inscribed on the liturgical calendar.

Relevant context: Throughout their classical history, the Greek city-states shared borders with several different cultures and civilizations, each contributing to the rich tapestry of intercultural interactions in the ancient Mediterranean world. To the north of Greece, the Greek states bordered the Thracians, a group of tribes residing in the region known as Thrace, which extended across parts of modern-day Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. The Thracians were known for their fierce warriors and distinctive artistic traditions, with Greek writers often describing them in both historical and mythical contexts.

To the northwest, the Illyrians, another group of tribal peoples, inhabited the western Balkans, including areas of modern Albania, Montenegro, and parts of the western Greek mainland. The Greeks and the Illyrians had extensive contacts, ranging from trade to conflict.

On the eastern front, across the Aegean Sea, Greek city-states like Ionia and significant islands such as Lesbos and Samos neighbored the expansive Persian Empire and the various Anatolian cultures. Before the rise of Persia as a dominant power, the region of Anatolia consisted of several small kingdoms and city-states, including the Lydians and Phrygians, each with its linguistic and cultural identity. The influence between the Greeks and Anatolian peoples can be observed in mythological and historical records, alongside archaeological findings suggesting shared artistic styles and technological advancements.

In the south, the Greeks shared maritime borders across the Mediterranean Sea with Egyptian culture and the civilizations of the Ancient Near East, including the Phoenicians, a seafaring people based in modern-day Lebanon. The Phoenicians were instrumental in the spread of the alphabet and facilitated trade and cultural exchange across the Mediterranean. This interaction enriched Greek literature, philosophy, and scientific knowledge.

Additionally, towards the west, Greece met Etruscan and Italic tribes in the Italian peninsula through colonies and trade, long before the rise of Rome. The Etruscans, residing in what is now Tuscany, heavily influenced early Roman culture and were known for their unique architecture and religious practices, which, through Roman adaptation, indirectly impacted broader Mediterranean cultural movements, including Greek.

"In contrast with other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words; and those ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters. Also, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, thus featuring many couplets like amic ""(male friend"") vs. amiga (""female friend"").",What other type of endings do Catalan words have?,consonant clusters,0,ENTY,"What other type of endings do Catalan words have?

Relevant context: Catalan, as a Romance language, shares many features with its linguistic relatives while also exhibiting unique characteristics. One area where Catalan demonstrates its distinctiveness is in the variety of word endings. These endings convey important grammatical information, including gender, number, and verb conjugations.

To begin with, Catalan nouns typically end in '-a' for feminine singular, such as ""casa"" (house), and in '-o' or a consonant for masculine singular, like ""gat"" (cat) or ""llibre"" (book). Pluralization is usually marked by adding '-s': ""cases"" for feminine plural and ""gats"" for masculine plural.

Adjectives in Catalan must agree in gender and number with the noun they modify, which affects their endings. A feminine adjective might end in '-a', as in ""bonica"" (beautiful), pluralized to ""boniques"". The masculine form might end in '-u', '-er', or '-re' among other variations. Masculine singular adjectives like ""alt"" (tall) become ""alts"" in the plural form.

Catalan verb endings vary significantly to express tense, mood, and person. Regular verbs fall into three conjugation groups: those ending in '-ar', '-er'/'-re', and '-ir' in the infinitive. For example, first conjugation verbs use endings like '-o', '-es', '-a' for the present indicative tense, as in ""parlo"" (I speak), ""parles"" (you speak), and ""parla"" (he/she/it speaks). Second and third conjugations show variations in these endings, such as ""-o"", ""-is"", ""-i"" in the first person singular present tense for some '-ir' verbs like ""dormo"" (I sleep).

Moreover, certain traditional Catalan words may end with diminutive suffixes '-et' or '-eta', implying smallness or affection, like ""carrer"" (street) becoming ""carreret"" (little street). 

In addition, verb past participles and adjectives can end in '-at', '-it', or '-ut', depending on the conjugation. For example, ""parlat"" (spoken) and ""sortit"" (gone out).

Overall, understanding these distinctive Catalan endings is essential for comprehending word forms and constructions within sentences. The language's morphology is deeply interwoven with its phonology, and attention to these endings can provide crucial insights into the grammatical structure and meaning of Catalan text and speech.",532.0,1284.0,1873,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,8.31791639328003,1.1715023517608643,10.61375880241394,Consonants,0.5
"Brahmi evolved into a multiplicity of Brahmic scripts, many of which were used to write Sanskrit. Roughly contemporary with the Brahmi, Kharosthi was used in the northwest of the subcontinent. Sometime between the fourth and eighth centuries, the Gupta script, derived from Brahmi, became prevalent. Around the eighth century, the Śāradā script evolved out of the Gupta script. The latter was displaced in its turn by Devanagari in the 11th or 12th century, with intermediary stages such as the Siddhaṃ script.

Relevant context: The Gupta script, which is an ancient Indian script that flourished during the Gupta Empire (circa 320 to 550 CE), played a significant role in the development of written communication in the Indian subcontinent. It is recognized as a descendant of the Brahmi script and is primarily known for its use as the writing system for Sanskrit and Prakrit during its period.

Over time, the Gupta script gradually evolved and gave rise to a number of regional scripts. The script that most notably replaced the Gupta script is the Nagari script, which later developed into the well-known Devanagari script used today for Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, and others.

The transition from the Gupta script to the Nagari script occurred around the 7th to 9th centuries CE. This shift was part of a broader trend in which the Gupta script diversified into several regional scripts across the Indian subcontinent. The Nagari script, known for its characteristic horizontal line running along the top of each letter, eventually became dominant in northern India due to its legibility and versatility.

The Nagari script itself developed further into the Devanagari script by the 10th century. It was used to pen many classical texts as well as administrative and religious documents. This evolution was driven by both phonetic and orthographic adjustments to suit the linguistic needs of the region as well as the cultural requirements for recording knowledge and sacred literature.

In summary, the Gupta script was eventually replaced by the Nagari script, which evolved into today's Devanagari script, underscoring the continuum of script evolution in India that reflects the dynamic linguistic history of the region.",339.0,1464.0,1858,1.0,1.0,1.0,14.9368736743927,0.9959464073181152,17.3605477809906,Śāradā script,0.0

Relevant context: Recent studies in the fields of archaeology and genetics have lent credence to the Greek tradition of the ancient city of Helike, a cultural hub that supposedly sank into the sea overnight. This tradition was primarily recorded by the Roman writer Pliny the Elder and the Greek geographer Strabo. According to their accounts, Helike was a prosperous city located in the region of Achaia, on the northern coast of the Peloponnese peninsula. Around 373 BCE, it was reportedly destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake, after which it was swallowed by the sea, leaving no trace visible on land.

For centuries, this story was considered to be more myth than history, likened to the enduring legend of Atlantis. However, a series of recent geological and archaeological studies have begun to corroborate key elements of this narrative. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, a dedicated archaeological project led by Dora Katsonopoulou and Steven Soter succeeded in identifying submerged structures off the coast of Aigion, near the modern-day site of the former city of Helike. The team's findings included pottery, coinage, and remnants of buildings that dated back to the Classical period, aligning with the time frame of Helike's destruction.

Parallel to this, geological surveys have identified evidence of massive seismic activity in the region consistent with a sudden, catastrophic event. Lidar surveys and sediment analysis have shown patterns of liquefaction and subsidence that match historical descriptions of the earthquake's impact. Additionally, recent advances in marine archaeology have allowed for more detailed exploration beneath the seabed. Sonar imaging and underwater excavation have revealed relics that suggest Helike may indeed have existed in the location and state described by ancient texts.

These discoveries have suggested that the tradition of Helike's sudden submersion was not an exaggeration. They have prompted historians and scientists alike to re-evaluate various Greek traditions once thought mythical. The story of Helike now serves as a potent reminder of the tenuous boundaries between myth and history in ancient narratives. This confirmation of the Greek tradition through modern scientific methods exemplifies the synergy between ancient storytelling and contemporary research, highlighting the depth of understanding possible when interdisciplinary approaches are applied.",455.0,1650.0,2163,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.065483808517456,1.0245258808135986,8.019043922424316,Shamanic religions,0.0
"Some powerful Polish nobles were referred to as ""magnates"" (Polish singular: ""magnat"", plural: ""magnaci"") and ""możny"" (""magnate"", ""oligarch""; plural: ""możni""); see Magnates of Poland and Lithuania.",What is the plural version of mozny?,możni,0,ENTY,"What is the plural version of mozny?

Relevant context: The term ""mozny"" appears to be a word that might originate from a language other than English, such as Polish, where ""możny"" means ""powerful"" or ""wealthy."" In Polish, nouns and adjectives can change form to indicate number or case, much like in many other languages with rich grammatical systems.

If we assume ""mozny"" is an adjective or noun in Polish, understanding its plural form would require knowledge of Polish grammar rules. Generally, for Polish adjectives and nouns, the plural form can depend on the noun class or gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and the case (nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.) being used.

In the nominative case, which is the form generally used for the subject of a sentence, the plural of the masculine personal ""możny"" would be ""możni."" This is consistent with the typical pattern where masculine nouns/adjectives in Polish that refer to animate or masculine personal objects often have plurals ending in ""-i.""

For non-masculine personal nouns, the endings might differ; for example, neuter and feminine nouns/adjectives might change to ""-e"" or ""-i,"" respectively, though context, specific word patterns, and exceptions can apply.

If ""mozny"" is used in a special context outside the standard grammatical constructs, such as colloquial or dialectal usage, or if it's a brand name or technical term, the pluralization rules could vary or might not follow traditional linguistic rules. Therefore, additional context about ""mozny"" and its language of origin is necessary for precise plural conversion.

In summary, the plural of ""mozny"" in Polish, when referring to a masculine personal adjective or noun, is ""możni."" This follows the typical Polish grammatical rules for pluralization and is important for understanding how adjectives and nouns are modified according to grammatical number in Polish.",400.0,1374.0,1829,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.844836711883545,1.2950010299682617,11.07734727859497,możni,1.0

Relevant context: To determine the English translation of a specific court and its duties, it's important to first identify the original term or name used in another language. Many countries have courts with unique responsibilities within their judicial systems, and these duties can reflect the court's place in the hierarchy or its specialized focus.

For instance, let's consider a hypothetical court called ""Tribunal de Première Instance"" from the French legal system. The English translation of this court would be ""Court of First Instance."" Courts of this nature generally serve as the initial level in the judicial hierarchy where legal proceedings are formally initiated. They typically handle both civil and criminal cases as an entry point for litigation. 

The duties of a Court of First Instance include managing preliminary hearings, evaluating evidence, issuing judgments on a wide array of minor to moderate civil disputes, and determining initial verdicts in criminal cases not reserved for higher courts. They may also involve processing legal documentation, overseeing small claims, family law issues such as divorce or child custody, and even certain administrative or tort litigation, depending on the jurisdiction.

Understanding the duties and function of such a court involves recognizing its role as a foundational component of the legal system, where most cases begin before possibly advancing to appellate courts upon dispute or appeal. This basic jurisdiction allows it to provide access to justice for the public, establishes legal order, and ensures that the law is applied consistently from the outset of a case.

In essence, the English translation and elaboration on the duties of a court like this enable one to grasp its fundamental place within a broader legal framework, guiding both the resolution of disputes and upholding of justice at the preliminary judicial level.",340.0,1847.0,2246,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.8165910243988037,1.150055170059204,5.890698671340942,High Court of Justice,0.0
"This new approach liberated scientific speculation from the dogmatic restraints of Aristotelian science, and paved the way for new approaches. Particularly within the field of theories of motion great advances were made, when such scholars as Jean Buridan, Nicole Oresme and the Oxford Calculators challenged the work of Aristotle. Buridan developed the theory of impetus as the cause of the motion of projectiles, which was an important step towards the modern concept of inertia. The works of these scholars anticipated the heliocentric worldview of Nicolaus Copernicus.",What scientist is most associated with the heliocentric worldview?,Nicolaus Copernicus,0,ENTY,"What scientist is most associated with the heliocentric worldview?

Relevant context: The scientist most closely associated with the heliocentric worldview is Nicolaus Copernicus. Born on February 19, 1473, in Toruń, Poland, Copernicus was a Renaissance-era polymath who made significant contributions to astronomy by proposing that the Sun, rather than the Earth, was at the center of the universe. This heliocentric model was revolutionary at the time, challenging the long-standing geocentric model endorsed by the Catholic Church, which placed the Earth at the center of the universe.

Copernicus detailed his heliocentric theory in his seminal work, ""De revolutionibus orbium coelestium"" (""On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres""), published in 1543, shortly before his death. This publication marked the beginning of a paradigm shift in astronomy, laying the groundwork for future scientists such as Johannes Kepler, who refined the model with elliptical orbits, and Galileo Galilei, who provided observational support with his telescopic discoveries.

The heliocentric model fundamentally changed the way humanity viewed its place in the cosmos. Despite initial resistance from religious authorities and other scholars, Copernicus's ideas gradually gained acceptance and were instrumental in the Scientific Revolution. His work not only altered the scientific perspective of the universe but also influenced philosophical and cultural views, heralding a new era of exploration and inquiry in various fields of study.",294.0,1388.0,1740,1.0,0.2,0.38685280723454163,4.219039440155029,0.866034984588623,6.075159311294556,Copernicus,0.8
"This view reveals a somewhat less than altruistic Christian intent of the British Empire; however, it was paradoxical from the beginning, as Simpson and most other writers pointed out.

Relevant context: Charles George Gordon, a British Army officer and administrator of the 19th century, is perhaps most well-known for his military exploits and his governance roles in different parts of the world. To fully appreciate how Gordon spent his time between various engagements, it is crucial to examine the key periods and shifts in his career.

After graduating from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Gordon was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in 1852. His early military career was marked by service in the Crimean War (1853-1856), where he gained significant experience and recognition for his bravery during the Siege of Sevastopol.

Following the Crimean War, Gordon spent time in the Far East, where he played a pivotal role in the Second Opium War (1856-1860) as part of the British occupation of Beijing. It was during his time in China that he earned the nickname ""Chinese Gordon"" for his leadership of the ""Ever Victorious Army,"" a force pitted against the Taiping Rebellion. This period firmly established his reputation as a capable and resourceful military leader.

Upon his return to England in the early 1860s, Gordon took some time to engage with military engineering projects, such as improving the defenses of Portsmouth. However, his predilection for adventure and service led him to accept a commission with the Khedive of Egypt in 1873, becoming the Governor of Equatoria, a province in the Sudan. Here, he focused on exploring the Sudanese hinterlands and attempted to suppress the burgeoning slave trade, tasks that consumed much of his time until he left Sudan in 1879 due to mounting political pressures.

Gordon’s subsequent role as the Governor-General of the Sudan from 1884 is perhaps the most dramatic phase of his career. During this period, Gordon tried to lead efforts against the Mahdist uprising, a task that ultimately led to the famous Siege of Khartoum. His call for reinforcements went unheeded for many months, leading to the fall of Khartoum and his death in 1885, an event that cemented his legacy as a tragic hero.

Between these major appointments, Gordon often returned to Britain, where he maintained connections with various influential figures, wrote reports, and sometimes engaged in religious and philanthropic activities. His time was also spent reflecting on his experiences and preparing for further assignments abroad.

In summary, Charles George Gordon spent his time between significant military campaigns, administrative roles in colonial outposts, periods of strategic travel, intermittent respite in Britain for reflection and planning, and engagement with religious and humanitarian work. His life was characterized by a restless desire to serve and contribute to causes he believed in, leaving little room for conventional domestic life.",564.0,1718.0,2336,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.7111194133758545,0.9339919090270996,7.625292539596558,Assignments,0.5

Relevant context: In Burma, officially known as Myanmar, the term ""ethnic minorities"" is commonly used to refer to those groups who do not belong to the Burman (or Bamar) majority. The Burman people are the largest ethnic group in Myanmar, and they primarily reside in the central and plains areas of the country. Ethnic minorities, however, comprise a significant part of the nation's population and are incredibly diverse, with over 135 officially recognized ethnic groups.

Some of the major ethnic minority groups include the Shan, Karen, Rakhine, Kachin, Chin, Mon, and Rohingya, among others. Each of these groups has its own distinct language, culture, and history. For example, the Shan people are one of the largest ethnic groups in Myanmar and are known for their rich cultural traditions and connections to the Tai ethnic groups across Southeast Asia. The Karen people are another sizable group, with a long history of advocacy for greater autonomy and rights within the nation.

Historically, ethnic minorities in Myanmar have faced challenges and discrimination, often stemming from longstanding ethnic tensions and political dynamics. Conflicts between the central government and various ethnic armed organizations have persisted for decades, influenced by issues of autonomy, resource control, and ethnic identity. The Rohingya, in particular, have suffered severe persecution, leading to international condemnation and a humanitarian crisis.

In contemporary discussions surrounding Myanmar's socio-political landscape, understanding and recognizing the diverse identities and struggles of its ethnic minorities are crucial. Advocacy groups and international organizations often stress the importance of using inclusive and respectful language when referring to these communities, emphasizing the need for their voices to be heard in national dialogues about peace, justice, and reconciliation.

Relevant context: During the period of Nazi rule from 1933 to 1945, non-compliance with the regime's demands often resulted in severe repercussions. The Nazi regime, under Adolf Hitler, demanded strict conformity and obedience from both individuals and groups within the territories they controlled. Those who resisted or failed to comply with Nazi demands faced a variety of potential punishments, which varied in severity depending on the nature and perceived threat of the non-compliance.

One of the most immediate consequences for non-compliance was arrest by the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police, or the SS, Hitler's elite paramilitary organization. Individuals who resisted Nazi policies or refused to comply with orders could be detained without trial and held in prisons or concentration camps. Inside these camps, prisoners faced horrific conditions, including forced labor, inadequate nutrition, and physical abuse. Many of those detained did not survive the experience.

Moreover, individuals or families who defied Nazi laws, such as those protecting or assisting Jews and other persecuted groups, often faced harsher repercussions. Such acts of defiance could lead to execution, either through a legal process designed to serve as a public deterrent or by extrajudicial killings. The Nazi regime sought to make examples of those who resisted to discourage others from similar acts of non-compliance.

Communities that collectively resisted could also face brutal collective punishment. For example, entire villages suspected of harboring resistance fighters or supporting the Partisan movement could be subject to reprisals, including massacres, destruction of property, and deportations.

Furthermore, non-compliance could also result in social and economic repercussions, such as exclusion from employment, seizure of property, and loss of civil rights. The Nazi regime maintained a comprehensive system of surveillance and denunciation, which fostered a climate of fear and conformity among the populace. Neighbors and colleagues could report acts of non-compliance that would lead to investigations and possible penalties for the accused.

In summary, not complying with Nazi demands typically resulted in a spectrum of punitive measures ranging from arrest and detainment to execution and social ostracism.

Relevant context: The period of European empires competing to control territories in Africa is historically referred to as the ""Scramble for Africa."" This term encapsulates the rapid colonization and annexation of African lands by European powers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Scramble for Africa is commonly considered to have begun in the 1880s and continued until the start of World War I in 1914.

A pivotal event in this period was the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, where major European nations, including Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, and Italy, convened to lay down rules for the peaceful division of Africa among them. Notably absent from these discussions were representatives from any African nation, highlighting the imperialist nature of the proceedings. The conference established guidelines aimed at minimizing conflicts among the European powers as they expanded their colonial territories.

The scramble was driven by a combination of factors, including economic interests, national prestige, and a belief in a civilizing mission, which Europeans often justified with the notion of the ""White Man's Burden."" The discovery of valuable resources such as gold, diamonds, and rubber further triggered intense competition among the powers. 

By the end of the scramble, nearly 90% of the African continent was under European control. Various regions were annexed with little regard for the existing ethnic or political boundaries, leading to the disruption of traditional societies and long-lasting impacts on the socio-political landscape of Africa. The aftermath of the Scramble for Africa laid the groundwork for future struggles for independence across the continent in the mid-20th century, as African nations sought to reclaim their sovereignty from colonial rule.

"Gray does not, however, give any indication of what available evidence these theories were at odds with, and his appeal to ""crucial support"" illustrates the very inductivist approach to science that Popper sought to show was logically illegitimate. For, according to Popper, Einstein's theory was at least equally as well corroborated as Newton's upon its initial conception; they both equally well accounted for all the hitherto available evidence. Moreover, since Einstein also explained the empirical refutations of Newton's theory, general relativity was immediately deemed suitable for tentative acceptance on the Popperian account. Indeed, Popper wrote, several decades before Gray's criticism, in reply to a critical essay by Imre Lakatos:",A possible rebuttal to Gray's argument appears in Popper's reply to which philosopher?,Imre Lakatos,0,ENTY,"A possible rebuttal to Gray's argument appears in Popper's reply to which philosopher?

Relevant context: In the realm of 20th-century philosophy of science, an intriguing intellectual interaction unfolds between John Gray and Karl Popper, where Gray's arguments about determinism and historical prediction stand in contrast to Popper's own perspectives. A critical moment in this ongoing philosophical dialogue can be found in Popper's reply to the philosopher Carl Gustav Hempel.

Popper's rebuttal to aspects of Gray's arguments emerges within the context of his discussion with Hempel, particularly concerning the nature of scientific explanation and the limits of predictability in historical sciences. Hempel, known for his work on the ""covering law"" model of scientific explanation, suggests that scientific understanding relies heavily on establishing general laws applicable to specific cases, a viewpoint that Gray aligns with to advocate for the predictability and determinism in history.

However, in his response to Hempel, Popper vigorously articulates his opposition to this deterministic framework. Popper challenges both Gray's and Hempel's reliance on universal laws, emphasizing instead the inherent unpredictability of human history and the role of human agency and creativity. He argues that the unique and often unpredictable decisions of individuals can dramatically alter the course of events, rendering precise historical prediction impossible.

Popper’s argument pivots on the concept of ""falsifiability,"" which he uses to critique deterministic approaches. He posits that any theory claiming absolute prediction in history must be subject to empirical testing and potential refutation—something he believes Gray's deterministic stance fails to accommodate due to its speculative nature.

Thus, Popper's thoughtful engagement with Hempel's ideas inadvertently serves as a compelling response to Gray, highlighting a philosophical commitment to the openness of historical possibilities as opposed to the rigidity of determinism. In examining Popper's profound reply to Hempel, one finds a rich and nuanced counterpoint to Gray, framed through a lens that elevates human unpredictability over deterministic certainty.",398.0,1562.0,2025,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,4.59248685836792,1.0028026103973389,6.4924633502960205,Imre Lakatos,1.0

Relevant context: The 1930s in China are typically referred to as a period characterized by significant turbulence and transformation. This decade is particularly known for the continuation of the Chinese Civil War, the impact of Japanese aggression, and the economic challenges facing the country. 

One of the most critical aspects of the 1930s in China was the ongoing conflict between the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, KMT), led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by figures such as Mao Zedong. This internal struggle, which began in the late 1920s, was marked by intense battles and shifting alliances. The Long March, a monumental event in Chinese history, occurred during this time. It was a strategic retreat by the CCP and their Red Army forces, covering over 6,000 miles and lasting from 1934 to 1935, which eventually established Mao Zedong as the undisputed leader of the Chinese communists.

Another pressing issue during the 1930s was the increasing aggression from Japan. The early part of the decade saw Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1931, following the Mukden Incident, where they established the puppet state of Manchukuo. The escalation of tension led to full-scale conflict with Japan by 1937, marked by the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which triggered the Second Sino-Japanese War. This war severely impacted China's economy and infrastructure and led to the suffering of millions of Chinese civilians.

Economically, the 1930s were challenging for China. The Great Depression, which affected much of the world, did not spare China, exacerbating the country's internal problems. Economic instability, inflation, and scarcity of resources added to the difficulties faced by both the government and the population.

Culturally, however, the 1930s were also a time of significant intellectual and artistic development. Despite the chaos, this era saw the rise of the “Golden Age” of Chinese cinema and literature, with Shanghai being the cultural hub. The city was home to a vibrant film industry and a burgeoning literary scene, producing works that have had a lasting impact on Chinese culture.

In summary, the 1930s in China, often seen through the lens of unrest and conflict, were crucial in shaping the nation's trajectory toward modernity.

Notably, the Protocol outlined specific guidelines for environmental protection, mandating that signatory countries implement measures to reduce emissions and promote sustainable practices. It emphasized the need for transparent reporting and accountability, requiring countries to submit regular progress reports to a central monitoring body.

Additionally, the Protocol introduced a set of standardized procedures for handling cross-border disputes, thereby facilitating smoother diplomatic interactions and minimizing conflicts. This included establishing an arbitration panel to mediate disagreements and providing a clear roadmap for resolution, which proved instrumental in fostering international trust and collaboration.

One of the most significant contributions of the Protocol was the creation of a unified regulatory system for trade-related activities, aiming to eliminate barriers and harmonize operational standards across different nations. By setting benchmarks for product safety, quality assurance, and labor practices, the Protocol helped in creating a level playing field for international businesses, thus boosting economic ties and promoting global trade.

Relevant context: In the medieval period, the region that is today known as Tibet was most commonly referred to by Chinese sources as ""Tǔbō"" (吐蕃). This name became prominent during the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), a time when Tibet's influence under the Tibetan Empire reached into various neighboring regions, including parts of what is now China. The term ""Tǔbō"" specifically referred to the powerful Tibetan Empire that established significant political and military presence across the region and maintained diplomatic and sometimes contentious relationships with the Tang dynasty. 

The use of ""Tǔbō"" can be traced back to historical records such as the ""Old Tang Book"" (舊唐書) and the ""New Tang Book"" (新唐書), both of which document interactions between the Tang dynasty and the Tibetan Empire. During this period, Tibet experienced significant cultural and religious developments, especially with the spread of Buddhism, which was itself influenced by interactions with Chinese culture.

In later periods, other names were sometimes used to refer to Tibet, but ""Tǔbō"" remains the best-known medieval designation. This historical name not only reflects the geopolitical landscape of the time but also the complex socio-cultural exchanges that occurred between Tibet and its neighbors. Understanding the term ""Tǔbō"" is crucial for historians studying Sino-Tibetan relations and the broader context of medieval Asian history.",296.0,1485.0,1837,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.396130800247192,1.4834387302398682,7.012226819992065,Tubo,1.0
"On the other hand, in his study on nine of ""the Bibles most widely in use in the English-speaking world"", Bible scholar Jason BeDuhn, Professor of Religious Studies at the Northern Arizona University, wrote: “The NW [New World Translation] emerges as the most accurate of the translations compared.” Although the general public and many Bible scholars assume that the differences in the New World Translation are the result of religious bias on the part of its translators, BeDuhn stated: “Most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal, conservative translation of the original expressions of the New Testament writers.” He added however that the insertion of the name Jehovah in the New Testament ""violate[s] accuracy in favor of denominationally preferred expressions for God"".",What is the New World Translation the most accurate translation of?,the Bibles most widely in use in the English-speaking world,0,ENTY,"What is the New World Translation the most accurate translation of?

Relevant context: The New World Translation (NWT) is the translation of the Bible produced by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, which is closely associated with Jehovah’s Witnesses. It was first published in the 1950s, with the complete Bible becoming available in 1961. The NWT is known for its efforts to provide a particularly accurate and consistent rendering of the original texts of the Bible, namely Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, from which the Old and New Testaments were derived.

The translation's primary goal was to adhere closely to the original languages of the Bible, and it includes features that are intended to reflect this focus on accuracy. For example, the NWT emphasizes the use of God’s name, rendered as ""Jehovah"" in the Old Testament, which is rooted in the Hebrew Tetragrammaton (YHWH). This choice distinguishes it from many other translations which tend to replace the divine name with titles like ""LORD.""

The translators of the New World Translation aimed to be consistent in their translation of words and phrases, even if those differ slightly from traditional renditions found in other English Bibles. This consistency can lead to a distinctive reading experience. For instance, in the New Testament, John 1:1 is translated as “the Word was a god” rather than the more traditional “the Word was God,” which reflects their particular interpretation of the Greek text there.

While the NWT is considered by Jehovah’s Witnesses as the most accurate translation for their religious convictions and doctrinal clarity, it is also often critiqued by scholars from other denominational backgrounds for perceived theological bias in particular passages. Nevertheless, its advocates argue that it provides a precise, readable, and understandable translation that captures the intended meanings of the original authors. Throughout its revisions, including a major revision in 2013, the NWT has sought to improve on the accuracy and readability by consulting a broader range of resources and updating the language to contemporary English usage.

For those researching translations that prioritize theological peculiarities aligned with Jehovah’s Witnesses’ teachings, the New World Translation is viewed as especially accurate for conveying those particular scriptural interpretations. However, for a broader academic or interdenominational consensus on biblical accuracy, the degree of its precision is subject to ongoing debate and comparison with other major Bible translations.",485.0,1606.0,2148,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.607395172119141,1.9850785732269287,9.85418438911438,The Bible,0.5

Relevant context: The Book of Daniel, found in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible and the Hebrew Bible, is a rich text that combines elements of history, prophecy, and apocalyptic literature. It is traditionally attributed to Daniel, a Hebrew prophet who lives during the Babylonian exile in the 6th century BCE. The Book of Daniel is structured into two main sections, each with distinct themes and literary styles.

The first section (chapters 1-6) is primarily historical narrative and recounts various episodes from Daniel's life in Babylon. It begins with Daniel and his companions being taken as young nobles from Jerusalem to Babylon, where they are trained in the court of King Nebuchadnezzar. This part of the book includes famous stories such as Daniel's interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream about the statue made of different metals in chapter 2; the fiery furnace episode in chapter 3, where Daniel's friends, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, are miraculously saved from a fiery death for refusing to worship an idol; Daniel interpreting another dream for Nebuchadnezzar in chapter 4; the writing on the wall at Belshazzar’s feast in chapter 5; and the well-known story of Daniel in the lion's den in chapter 6, where he is saved by divine intervention after being trapped due to a decree against praying to God.

The second section (chapters 7-12) shifts to a series of apocalyptic visions and prophecies. These visions are symbolic and often feature fantastical beasts and other imagery typical of apocalyptic literature. In chapter 7, Daniel has a vision of four great beasts emerging from the sea, representing successive kingdoms, culminating in the establishment of God's eternal kingdom. Chapter 8 contains the vision of the ram and the goat, which foretells the rise and fall of empires. In chapter 9, Daniel prays and receives the prophecy of the “Seventy Weeks,” which has been interpreted in various ways regarding the coming of a messianic age. Chapters 10-12 provide a detailed vision of a great conflict, including insights into the future of Israel and apocalyptic events leading to the end times. 

Throughout the Book of Daniel, themes such as faithfulness in exile, divine sovereignty, and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom are emphasized. Daniel is portrayed as a model of piety and wisdom, withstanding the pressures of a foreign culture while retaining his religious integrity. Ultimately, the book serves both as a message of hope to those in exile and a prophetic revelation of future events, encouraging readers to remain steadfast in their faith.",544.0,1810.0,2409,1.0,0.14285714285714285,0.3333333333333333,4.774835586547852,1.3981146812438965,7.246314525604248,Nutritional experiment,0.7
"Albert the Great wrote that wisdom and understanding enhance one's faith in God. According to him, these are the tools that God uses to commune with a contemplative. Love in the soul is both the cause and result of true understanding and judgement. It causes not only an intellectual knowledge of God, but a spiritual and emotional knowledge as well. Contemplation is the means whereby one can obtain this goal of understanding. Things that once seemed static and unchanging become full of possibility and perfection. The contemplative then knows that God is, but she does not know what God is. Thus, contemplation forever produces a mystified, imperfect knowledge of God. The soul is exalted beyond the rest of God's creation but it cannot see God Himself.","If someone contemplates God forever, what type of knowledge will they obtain?",imperfect,0,ENTY,"If someone contemplates God forever, what type of knowledge will they obtain?

Relevant context: Contemplating God, often seen as the ultimate act of reflection and meditation, is an endeavor rooted in the exploration of both the divine and the self. If someone were to contemplate God forever, the type of knowledge they might obtain would likely be vast and multidimensional, traversing various philosophical, theological, and mystical domains.

Firstly, such an individual might gain a profound understanding of theology, which is the study of the nature of the divine. This would entail grasping the complex attributes of God that are typically discussed in various religious doctrines, such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, and benevolence. The knowledge would potentially include insights into how these attributes manifest in the world and impact human life.

Additionally, this perpetual contemplation could lead to an exploration of the idea of God as the source of all creation. This includes understanding concepts related to the origin of the universe, the nature of existence, and the purpose of life. Such contemplation may lead to numerous philosophical insights and hypotheses about the metaphysical aspects of reality, including the existence of an ultimate truth or an absolute being.

From a mystical perspective, eternal contemplation might facilitate an experiential knowledge of the divine. Mystics often describe this as a direct encounter or union with God. This knowledge surpasses intellectual understanding and enters the realm of spiritual experience, where the individual may feel a deep sense of communion, love, and peace that transcends ordinary perception.

Moreover, there is the potential to gain ethical and moral insights. Contemplating God forever might bring about an enhanced understanding of universal principles like love, compassion, justice, and mercy. The individual could develop a more profound understanding of the moral implications of their actions and how they align with the divine will or ethical teachings related to God.

In addition to these areas, the endless contemplation of God might also encourage the individual to engage with historical and cultural perspectives on divinity. This includes knowledge about how different religions and cultures conceive of God and the significance of God in shaping human history, society, and personal identity.

Finally, such contemplation is likely to involve an inward journey, leading to increased self-awareness and insight into one's own nature and purpose. The act of contemplating God is, in many traditions, also an act of introspection, resulting in knowledge about personal growth, transformation, and the realization of one's potential in relation to the divine.

In sum, if someone were to contemplate God forever, they might acquire a profound and varied body of knowledge that integrates intellectual, philosophical, mystical, ethical, cultural, and personal insights, potentially transforming their understanding of both the divine and themselves.",540.0,1799.0,2400,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.249001979827881,1.1893644332885742,8.541429281234741,Imperfect knowledge,0.5

The former two books were aimed exclusively at professional mathematicians, while the latter book was intended for a larger audience, covering the history of mathematics and its philosophical foundations. Principia Mathematica in particular is regarded as one of the most important works in mathematical logic of the 20th century.",What did Whitehead publish numerous articles about?,mathematics,0,ENTY,"What did Whitehead publish numerous articles about?

Relevant context: Alfred North Whitehead, a prominent philosopher and mathematician, published numerous articles on a wide range of topics, but he is particularly renowned for his work in process philosophy and the philosophy of science. Whitehead's contributions are often centered around the idea of process as fundamental to understanding reality, as opposed to static entities. 

In the realm of process philosophy, Whitehead developed a metaphysical framework in which reality is composed of events rather than material objects. This framework challenged the traditional Newtonian paradigm by suggesting that processes, change, and relationships are central to the fabric of the universe. His work in this area laid the foundation for what came to be known as 'process thought,' which has influenced various fields, including theology, ecology, and physics.

Additionally, Whitehead's articles often addressed the philosophy of science. He was interested in the relationship between scientific theories and the metaphysical assumptions underlying them. In particular, Whitehead critiqued the reductionist tendencies of classical science and advocated for a more integrated approach that considers the interconnections between different disciplines.

Whitehead's articles are characterized by a deep engagement with both philosophical inquiry and scientific understanding. He frequently explored themes such as the nature of space and time, the role of perception and abstraction in scientific theories, and the impact of scientific discoveries on metaphysical concepts.

"In Theravada Buddhism there can be no divine salvation or forgiveness for one's karma, since it is a purely impersonal process that is a part of the makeup of the universe.[citation needed] In Mahayana Buddhism, the texts of certain Mahayana sutras (such as the Lotus Sutra, the Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra and the Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra) claim that the recitation or merely the hearing of their texts can expunge great swathes of negative karma. Some forms of Buddhism (for example, Vajrayana) regard the recitation of mantras as a means for cutting off of previous negative karma. The Japanese Pure Land teacher Genshin taught that Amitābha has the power to destroy the karma that would otherwise bind one in saṃsāra.",What Buddhism says that salvation is unattainable?,Theravada Buddhism,0,ENTY,"What Buddhism says that salvation is unattainable?

Relevant context: In Buddhism, the concept of salvation is quite different from many Western religions. Rather than focusing on salvation in a divine or otherworldly sense, Buddhism typically centers around the attainment of enlightenment, which is the realization of Nirvana, the cessation of suffering, and freedom from the cycle of birth and rebirth (samsara). However, your query seems to refer to a particular viewpoint within Zen Buddhism that emphasizes the unattainability of enlightenment.

Zen Buddhism, especially in its Rinzai and Soto schools, sometimes uses the teaching that enlightenment cannot be ""attained"" in the traditional sense. This is not to suggest that it is impossible, but rather to convey that enlightenment is not something outside oneself to be reached like a goal or an object. In Zen, especially in the teachings associated with teachers like Dogen in the Soto tradition, enlightenment is not seen as an ultimate destination but as an intrinsic aspect of reality. One famous Zen saying is ""ordinary mind is the Way,"" meaning that enlightenment is found in the simple, everyday mind, unclouded by distractions or attachments.

Such teachings aim to dissolve the dualistic thinking that separates the seeker from the sought. The idea is that striving for enlightenment as if it were a distant prize perpetuates a sense of separation and duality. True understanding is more about realization than acquisition—recognizing enlightenment as one's inherent nature rather than something to be gained externally.

In practice, this philosophy encourages Buddhists to engage in zazen (meditation) and mindful living not with the aim of ""achieving"" enlightenment, but rather with the understanding that such practices help reveal one's true nature, already interconnected with enlightenment. So, in this sense, Zen Buddhism posits a paradoxical teaching that ""salvation,"" or enlightenment, is both unattainable and ever-present. The language of unattainability serves as a skillful means (upaya) to shift the practitioner's focus from goal-oriented practice to a presence-oriented realization of their Buddha-nature.",413.0,1237.0,1704,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.153783321380615,1.0366957187652588,8.305886030197144,None,0.0

Relevant context: The Italian Armenian monastery in question is most likely referring to the Mekhitarist Monastery on the island of San Lazzaro degli Armeni in Venice, Italy. This monastery is a Roman Catholic institution, but it is deeply rooted in the Armenian Apostolic tradition, reflecting the unique history and culture of the Armenian people within the broader Roman Catholic Church. 

The Mekhitarist Monastery is home to the Mekhitarist Order, a congregation of Armenian Rite Benedictine monks. It was founded by the Armenian monk Mekhitar of Sebaste in 1701. Originally established in Constantinople, the order relocated to Venice in 1717, where it found a permanent home on San Lazzaro Island, a gift from the Venetian Republic.

The religious practices at the monastery emphasize the Armenian liturgy, language, and culture, all while maintaining communion with the Roman Catholic Church. This is a distinctive blend, as the monastery serves as a bridge between the Eastern traditions of Armenian Christianity and Western Catholicism. The monks are particularly dedicated to preserving Armenian heritage through scholarship, publishing, and education.

The Mekhitarist Monastery is renowned for its impressive library, extensive manuscript collections, and historical artifacts, making it a center of Armenian cultural preservation. The monastery's role is not only religious but also cultural, hosting significant academic and literary endeavors.

"Demand in Europe for Chinese goods such as silk, tea, and ceramics could only be met if European companies funneled their limited supplies of silver into China. In the late 1700s, the governments of Britain and France were deeply concerned about the imbalance of trade and the drain of silver. To meet the growing Chinese demand for opium, the British East India Company greatly expanded its production in Bengal. Since China's economy was essentially self-sufficient, the country had little need to import goods or raw materials from the Europeans, so the usual way of payment was through silver. The Daoguang Emperor, concerned both over the outflow of silver and the damage that opium smoking was causing to his subjects, ordered Lin Zexu to end the opium trade. Lin confiscated the stocks of opium without compensation in 1839, leading Britain to send a military expedition the following year.",What did the Chinese want in return?,silver,0,ENTY,"What did the Chinese want in return?

Relevant context: In response to the query ""What did the Chinese want in return?"", it is important to delve into the historical, economic, and geopolitical contexts where such a question might be relevant. The answer could pertain to various scenarios such as trade negotiations, diplomatic agreements, or cultural exchanges. 

For instance, during the Silk Road era, Chinese traders were particularly interested in obtaining luxury goods, exotic flora and fauna, and precious metals. In exchange for their silk, porcelain, and spices, they sought products like gold, silver, woolen textiles, and glassware from the Roman Empire and other regions.

Moving to the 19th century, during the Qing Dynasty's interactions with Western powers, the Chinese often sought to maintain sovereignty, control over trade, and limit foreign influence within their borders. The British desire for Chinese tea, silk, and porcelain led to the Opium Wars, after which China was forced to accept unfavorable trade terms and cede Hong Kong to Britain. In this context, China sought to retain political autonomy and recover territorial integrity.

In the modern era, during trade negotiations with countries like the United States, China has primarily been interested in access to advanced technology, agricultural products, and removal of tariffs that affect Chinese exports. Additionally, China often seeks investment opportunities in infrastructure and a favorable balance of trade.

In diplomatic relations, particularly with developing countries, China has looked for support in international forums, access to natural resources, and opportunities for Chinese enterprises to invest in infrastructure projects as part of initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative.

Relevant context: The query regarding the importance of faith in and veneration of the Mahayana tradition can be addressed by examining several key Mahayana sutras, which emphasize these themes.

One of the primary texts in Mahayana Buddhism that elaborates on the significance of faith is the *Sutra of Golden Light* (Suvarṇaprabhāsa Sūtra). This sutra highlights the transformative power of faith in the teachings of the Mahayana. It presents faith as a critical prerequisite for attaining enlightenment and underscores the protection and blessings that come to those who sincerely venerate the Mahayana path. The sutra depicts celestial beings, including goddesses like Sarasvati, who venerate and protect those with deep faith in Mahayana teachings.

Another pivotal text is the *Lotus Sutra* (Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra), which expresses the importance of faith and devotion. The *Lotus Sutra* emphasizes the universality of Buddhahood and the potential for all beings to achieve enlightenment. It is particularly revered for its Parable of the Burning House, illustrating how faith in the Mahayana teachings leads one out of the suffering of samsara. The sutra extols the virtues of those who uphold, read, recite, and have faith in the sutra, promising them eventual enlightenment.

The *Vimalakīrti Sūtra* is also significant in this context, as it underscores the non-dual nature of reality and the role of faith in understanding this profound truth. It presents the layman Vimalakīrti, whose wisdom and understanding are highly venerated, thereby demonstrating how deep faith in Mahayana principles leads to wisdom that transcends ordinary understanding.

Finally, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* (or the Flower Garland Sutra) provides an expansive vision of the cosmos and integrates faith as a foundation for entering into the bodhisattva path. This sutra portrays an interconnected universe where all beings can achieve enlightenment, emphasizing the bodhisattva ideal of compassion and the merit of devotional practices.

These texts collectively articulate the essential role of faith and veneration in Mahayana Buddhism, guiding practitioners toward enlightenment and embodying the reverence for the Mahayana path as a profound spiritual journey.",476.0,1596.0,2142,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.803183317184448,1.1296231746673584,11.051806211471558,"Lotus Sutra, Mahaparinirvana Sutra",1.0
"A major concern of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) and of the philosophy of Spirit that he lays out in his Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences (1817–1830) is the interrelation between individual humans, which he conceives in terms of ""mutual recognition."" However, what Climacus means by the aforementioned statement, is that Hegel, in the Philosophy of Right, believed the best solution was to surrender one's individuality to the customs of the State, identifying right and wrong in view of the prevailing bourgeois morality. Individual human will ought, at the State's highest level of development, to properly coincide with the will of the State. Climacus rejects Hegel's suppression of individuality by pointing out it is impossible to create a valid set of rules or system in any society which can adequately describe existence for any one individual. Submitting one's will to the State denies personal freedom, choice, and responsibility.",Whose will did Hegel believe should prevail over that of the individual?,State,0,HUM,"Whose will did Hegel believe should prevail over that of the individual?

Relevant context: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, the influential German philosopher, deeply explored the relationship between the individual and the collective in his philosophical work. Hegel believed that the individual's will should align with and ultimately be subsumed under the will of a greater entity, which he identified as the ""universal will"" or ""world spirit."" This concept is central to his philosophy, particularly as expressed in works such as ""The Phenomenology of Spirit"" and ""The Philosophy of Right.""

For Hegel, the ""universal will"" is embodied by ethical institutions such as the family, civil society, and, most importantly, the state. He saw the state as the highest expression of collective rationality and ethical life, which he termed ""Sittlichkeit"" (ethical order). Hegel argued that the state represents the realization of freedom in the rational will, meaning that true freedom is found not in the pursuit of individual desires, but in participating in the rational institutions that govern society.

In this way, Hegel posited that the individual's will should conform to the universal will of the state, as the state is considered the embodiment of objective spirit and rational freedom. This does not eradicate individual autonomy, but rather situates it within a broader ethical framework where individuals fulfill their freedom through duty and participation in societal norms that promote the common good.

Ultimately, Hegel's philosophy suggested that the reconciliation of the individual's subjective will with the objective universal will leads to the actualization of freedom and ethical life. This was a pivotal aspect of his thought, contrasting sharply with the more libertarian perspectives that prioritize individual autonomy over communal values.",339.0,1917.0,2316,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.310218572616577,1.1415228843688965,6.487267255783081,State's,0.5

Relevant context: The question of who was the first head of Kiev is steeped in historical uncertainty and legend. According to the ""Primary Chronicle,"" a crucial source written in the early 12th century that compiles East Slavic history and tales, Kiev was purportedly founded by three legendary brothers—Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv—and their sister, Lybid. Kyi, the eldest of the siblings, is often considered to be the first ruler or head of Kiev, a title described in various narratives. While the historical accuracy of the Chronicle is debated, Kyi's name has persisted through generations as a foundational figure in the city's storied past.

Archaeological evidence suggests that the area around Kiev was settled in prehistoric times, but the legendary narrative places the founding of a coherent city or settlement around the 6th to 9th centuries. Kyi's association with Kiev is more symbolic than definitively confirmed by historical records, but he is remembered as a key figure in Ukrainian folklore and cultural identity, emblematic of the city's origin.

It is important to note that the subsequent ruling of Kiev becomes more factually documented with figures such as Oleg of Novgorod, a Varangian prince who seized control of the city around 882 CE, establishing the Kievan Rus'—a powerful federation that heralded the advent of significant Slavonic statecraft.

"During the presidential referendum in Egypt, Nasser was re-elected to a second term as UAR president and took his oath on 25 March 1965. He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned bank loans to private business and introducing incentives to increase exports. During the 60's, the Egyptian economy went from sluggishness to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.",The leader of what organization was imprisoned by Nasser?,Muslim Brotherhood,0,HUM,"The leader of what organization was imprisoned by Nasser?

Relevant context: Gamal Abdel Nasser, the second President of Egypt, played a pivotal role in the modern history of the Middle East. During his leadership, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, Nasser was known for his efforts to consolidate power and promote Arab nationalism. One significant event associated with his regime was the imprisonment of the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, an influential Islamist organization in Egypt. 

In 1954, tensions between Nasser and the Muslim Brotherhood escalated dramatically. After an assassination attempt on Nasser on October 26, 1954, which was blamed on the Brotherhood, Nasser cracked down on the organization. Sayyid Qutb, one of the group's prominent theorists and leaders, was arrested during this period. Although initially imprisoned following the hostilities, Qutb's writings from his time in jail would later significantly influence Islamic fundamentalist thought.

The conflict between Nasser and the Muslim Brotherhood marked a critical point in Egyptian politics, as Nasser sought to suppress rival political groups and ideologies that he perceived as threats to his secular, nationalist agenda. The imprisonment of Sayyid Qutb and other members of the Muslim Brotherhood highlighted Nasser's determination to control the political landscape in Egypt and marginalize the Brotherhood's influence. After years of imprisonment, Sayyid Qutb was eventually put on trial and executed in 1966, an event that further solidified his status as a martyr in the eyes of his followers and underscored the contentious relations between Egyptian authorities and the Muslim Brotherhood during Nasser's presidency.",332.0,1424.0,1813,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,3.952641248703003,1.0368239879608154,6.028237342834473,Muslim Brotherhood,1.0
"In the wake of the racially-motivated"" church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, Yale was under criticism again in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, which was named after John C. Calhoun, a slave-owner and strong slavery supporter in the nineteenth century. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change. They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an ""extraordinary American statesman""—he was ""one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy"" in the history of the United States. In August 2015 Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed. He described Calhoun as a ""a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina."" He acknowledged that Calhoun also ""believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests."" Racial tensions increased in the fall of 2015 centering on comments by Nicholas A. Christakis and his wife Erika regarding freedom of speech. In April 2016 Salovey announced that ""despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests,"" Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's ""shadow"" so they will be ""better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future.""

Relevant context: In response to growing awareness and calls for action to address systemic inequality, a significant title change is set to take place this year as part of a broader initiative to reduce racial tensions. The board of trustees at Washington Park, a historic site with deep-rooted and contested associations, has announced that the park will be renamed Unity Park. This decision comes after extensive consultations with community leaders, historians, and residents to ensure that the new name reflects an inclusive vision that honors all cultural contributions and narratives.

Historically, Washington Park was named in the late 19th century after a local figure whose legacy has been reassessed in recent years due to historical ties with exclusionary practices. The name change is part of an overarching policy to rectify historical injustices and promote a sense of belonging and harmony among the diverse populace.

This initiative is anticipated to foster a welcoming atmosphere and pave the way for healing by acknowledging past grievances and moving toward a more unified community identity. Local government officials emphasize that the renaming of public spaces, though symbolic, is a critical step in addressing racial tensions by promoting dialogue and mutual respect.

The decision to rename the park was met with widespread support, reflecting a community-driven desire to create spaces that genuinely represent and respect the diversity of its inhabitants. As part of the renaming process, a series of educational workshops and public forums have been scheduled to engage the community further and inform them of the historical context and significance behind the name change.

"In 2004, philosopher and psychologist Michel ter Hark (Groningen, The Netherlands) published a book, called Popper, Otto Selz and the rise of evolutionary epistemology, in which he claimed that Popper took some of his ideas from his tutor, the German psychologist Otto Selz. Selz never published his ideas, partly because of the rise of Nazism, which forced him to quit his work in 1933, and the prohibition of referring to Selz' work. Popper, the historian of ideas and his scholarship, is criticised in some academic quarters for his rejection of Plato, Hegel and Marx.",Who claimed Otto Selz deserved credit for ideas published by Popper?,Michel ter Hark,0,HUM,"Who claimed Otto Selz deserved credit for ideas published by Popper?

Relevant context: In the early 20th century, Otto Selz was a German psychologist and philosopher who made significant contributions to the understanding of problem-solving and scientific methodology. Some scholars have suggested that Selz's ideas influenced later developments in these fields. One key figure who allegedly drew from Selz's work is Karl Popper, a philosopher of science renowned for his contributions to the philosophy of scientific inquiry.

The claim that Otto Selz deserved credit for ideas published by Karl Popper was made by historian of psychology Wolfgang Pöckl. In his extensive research on the intellectual environment of early 20th-century Germany, Pöckl outlined how Selz, who was largely overshadowed by the political upheavals of his time, particularly the rise of Nazism, developed several concepts resembling Popper's later theories. These include the ideas of problem-solving and hypothesis testing, which are central to Popper's theory of falsifiability as a demarcation criterion between science and non-science.

Pöckl argued that Otto Selz's early work on cognitive processes and logical reasoning laid a foundation that might have implicitly or explicitly influenced Popper. Although there is no direct evidence of collaboration or acknowledgment, Popper studied in Austria and Germany during a time when Selz's ideas were circulating in academic circles, providing a plausible context for intellectual exchange.

Moreover, Selz's untimely death and the limited dissemination of his work, exacerbated by the tumultuous period he lived through, contributed to the overshadowing of his contributions. Supporters of Pöckl's claim advocate for a reevaluation of Selz’s work within the broader history of psychological and philosophical thought, proposing that Selz should be recognized for his pioneering insights that may have prefigured some of Popper's philosophical breakthroughs.

Relevant context: In the world of football, FC Barcelona and RCD Espanyol are two teams that share not only a city but a rich history of rivalry. This local rivalry is a defining feature of Catalan football culture, with both clubs being based in Barcelona, Spain's second-largest city and the capital of the Catalonia region. FC Barcelona, commonly referred to as Barça, is known for its global prominence and success, whereas RCD Espanyol, often called simply Espanyol, has traditionally been perceived as the city's underdog in football.

The rivalry, known as the ""Derbi barceloní,"" is historically linked to regional and cultural tensions. FC Barcelona is seen as the embodiment of Catalan pride and nationalism, often associated with the broader political movement for Catalan independence and identity. In contrast, RCD Espanyol's roots are traditionally aligned with more Spanish nationalist sentiments, although this aspect has become less pronounced in recent years.

Matches between these two clubs are always keenly contested, irrespective of their positions in the La Liga standings.

"Alexis de Tocqueville described the French Revolution as the inevitable result of the radical opposition created in the 18th century between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment.

This illusory power came from the rise of ""public opinion"", born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political sphere. The ""literary politics"" that resulted promoted a discourse of equality and was hence in fundamental opposition to the monarchical regime. De Tocqueville ""clearly designates ... the cultural effects of transformation in the forms of the exercise of power"".

Relevant context: In his seminal work, ""Democracy in America,"" Alexis de Tocqueville delves into the social and political fabric of early 19th-century America. Among his observations, Tocqueville describes the legal profession in the United States as forming ""a substitute aristocracy that was both all-powerful and without real power."" This seemingly paradoxical statement captures Tocqueville’s nuanced view of the role of lawyers in American society.

Tocqueville argued that lawyers, by virtue of their education, social standing, and the nature of their work, occupied a unique position akin to that of the aristocracy in Europe. They were considered all-powerful in the sense that they played a crucial role in shaping and interpreting laws, serving as the guardians of legal order, and providing a stabilizing influence in the democratic society of America.

However, despite their significant influence, Tocqueville contended that lawyers in the United States did not wield actual political power in the traditional sense. Unlike an hereditary aristocracy, their influence was not institutionalized or supported by formal titles and privileges. Instead, their power was derived from their expertise and their ability to sway public opinion and governmental decisions through legal reasoning.

This duality of immense influence without direct political control intrigued Tocqueville and highlighted the distinctive nature of American democracy, where power could manifest in subtle, non-traditional forms. Lawyers, thus, stood as a testament to this complex interplay between democracy and aristocracy, embodying the potential for elite influence within a society fundamentally opposed to traditional hierarchies.",338.0,1516.0,1926,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.4909119606018066,1.1148757934570312,5.5140111446380615,men of letters,1.0

This marker correlates remarkably well with the distribution of Slavic-speakers today. The team led by Peter Underhill, which discovered M458, did not consider the possibility that this was a Slavic marker, since they used the ""evolutionary effective"" mutation rate, which gave a date far too old to be Slavic.

Relevant context: The search for the Slavic sub-group of R1a1a [M17], an important Y-DNA haplogroup, was significantly advanced by the work of several geneticists and researchers specializing in population genetics. One of the leading figures in this field was Dr. Tomasz Grzybowski, a Polish geneticist whose research into Y-chromosome diversity across Europe has been groundbreaking. Dr. Grzybowski, along with his team, conducted extensive phylogenetic analyses of the R1a1a haplogroup to identify region-specific markers that distinguish the Slavic sub-branches from other European and Asian lineages.

His studies primarily focused on analyzing DNA samples from a broad array of populations across Eastern and Central Europe, where the Slavic languages and cultures are most prevalent. Through these analyses, Grzybowski and his collaborators were able to pinpoint specific genetic mutations that characterize the Slavic expansions, particularly during the early medieval period when various Slavic tribes migrated and settled in vast areas of Europe.

Additionally, researchers like Professor Peter Underhill from Stanford University have also delved into this haplogroup. Underhill's work, often cited in studies of European and Central Asian Y-DNA lineages, supported the findings regarding the spread and diversification of R1a1a across the European continent. His research emphasized the significant prevalence of R1a1a among Slavic-speaking populations compared to their neighboring groups, further corroborating the idea of a distinct Slavic genetic marker within the R1a1a haplogroup.

These findings have been pivotal in tracing the historical migrations of Slavic peoples, offering insights not only into ancient population dynamics but also into the modern distribution patterns of genetic lineages across Europe. This information has proven invaluable in the fields of archaeology and history, providing a genetic perspective that complements traditional methodologies.

To the south of Zhejiang province, one finds the geographical expanse of Fujian province, which is characterized by its rugged terrain and scenic coastline along the East China Sea. Fujian shares a significant border with Zhejiang, demarcated by natural features and a historical context that has shaped the interactions between these regions over the centuries. Known for its mountains and dense forests, Fujian is renowned for its diverse cultural heritage and has played an important role in maritime trade due to its strategic position along the southeastern coast of China.

The boundary between Zhejiang and Fujian is not just a political demarcation but also a fascinating confluence of different climatic, cultural, and ecological zones. This section of southeastern China is known for its subtropical climate, contributing to rich biodiversity and lush landscapes. The vibrant cultural exchanges between the two provinces are evidenced by shared traditions and culinary influences. As close neighbors, Zhejiang and Fujian exhibit both distinct and interconnected histories, languages, and economies, making them vital components of China’s southeastern corridor.

Understanding how Fujian to the south influences Zhejiang provides insight into the socio-economic dynamics of the region. The thriving port cities in Fujian, such as Xiamen and Fuzhou, facilitate commerce and cultural exchange with Zhejiang, with both provinces contributing significantly to China's modern economic tapestry.

"The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages.

In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region.

Relevant context: The Sarmatians, a confederation of Iranian-speaking tribes, played a significant role on the European steppes from around the 6th century BCE to the early medieval period. Their territory extended across parts of what are now modern-day Ukraine, southern Russia, and eastern Europe. By the early centuries of the Common Era, the Sarmatians began to encounter increasing pressure from various groups, among them the migrating Gothic and Germanic tribes. However, it was not until the emergence of the pre-Slavic peoples during the early medieval period that the Sarmatian cultural and ethnic dominance became increasingly diluted.

The transition from Sarmatian to Slavic dominance in these regions was a gradual process that took place over several centuries. It is generally agreed among historians and archaeologists that the Sarmatian areas were increasingly absorbed by pre-Slavic groups starting around the 5th century CE. By the 6th and 7th centuries, the presence of the Sarmatians had significantly diminished, as they were either assimilated into the emerging Slavic populations or pushed further south and east by these expanding groups. 

The spread of Slavic peoples during this period was part of a broader series of migrations known as the Slavic expansion, which occurred from roughly the 6th to the 9th centuries. During this time, Slavic tribes moved into the lands previously occupied by various nomadic and semi-nomadic groups, including the Sarmatians. This transition is marked by archaeological evidence, such as distinct changes in pottery styles, burial practices, and settlement patterns, indicating the influence and eventual predominance of Slavic culture in the region.

Therefore, it can be concluded that by the 6th to 7th centuries CE, the areas once inhabited by the Sarmatians had largely been absorbed by pre-Slavic people. This absorption was a result of both cultural assimilation and displacement, which led to the Sarmatians' gradual disappearance as a distinct group in Eastern Europe.",431.0,1987.0,2485,1.0,0.25,0.43067655807339306,7.327725648880005,0.9977602958679199,9.258001804351807,6th century,1.0

Prior to his leadership at the LNP, Newman had served as the Lord Mayor of Brisbane from 2004 to 2011, a position that elevated his political profile in Queensland. Interestingly, at the time of his appointment as the LNP leader, Newman was not a sitting member of the Queensland Parliament. This unique circumstance arose when the party chose him as their leader in April 2011, anticipating that his leadership would significantly boost their chances against the incumbent Labor government led by Anna Bligh.

Campbell Newman's entry into state politics and subsequent leadership marked a strategic turn for the LNP, which was a relatively new political entity formed in 2008 through a merger between the Queensland divisions of the Liberal Party of Australia and the Nationals. The 2012 election was crucial for the LNP as they aimed to end Labor's 14-year hold on power in Queensland.

During the election campaign, Newman focused on a platform that promised economic reform, improving infrastructure, and reducing the cost of living.

As the county town of the County Palatine of Chester, the city held both administrative and legal importance during the Middle Ages, having its own courts and governance independent of the monarch's direct influence.

Meanwhile, for the County Palatine of Durham, the city of Durham serves as the county town. Historically, the Bishop of Durham held significant secular powers similar to those of a prince due to the county’s palatine status, which is reflected in landmarks like the Durham Cathedral and Durham Castle, both of which stand prominently in the city. Durham’s role as a county town has made it a crucial location for ecclesiastical and civic administration in the northeast of England.

Each of these county towns, Lancaster, Chester, and Durham, plays a vital role in the history and governance of their respective counties, especially in the context of their palatine status, which granted them distinctive privileges and responsibilities under the realm.",417.0,1442.0,1916,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,4.337858438491821,3.0759875774383545,8.42011022567749,Lancaster,1.0

"In 1941, Reza Shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and established the Persian Corridor, a massive supply route that would last until the end of the ongoing war. The presence of so many foreign troops in the nation also culminated in the Soviet-backed establishment of two puppet regimes in the nation; the Azerbaijan People's Government, and the Republic of Mahabad. As the Soviet Union refused to relinquish the occupied Iranian territory, the Iran crisis of 1946 was followed, which particularly resulted in the dissolution of both puppet states, and the withdrawal of the Soviets.",What happened which ended in two puppet states dissolving and Soviet withdrawal out of Iran after WWII?,the Iran crisis of 1946,0,HUM,"What happened which ended in two puppet states dissolving and Soviet withdrawal out of Iran after WWII?

Relevant context: In the final years of World War II, Iran became a stage for geopolitical maneuvering between the Allied powers, particularly the Soviet Union and Great Britain. In 1941, British and Soviet troops invaded Iran in a joint operation to secure oil fields and ensure supply lines for the Allies. These occupations came under the auspices of the Anglo-Soviet invasion, ostensibly to prevent Iran under Reza Shah from aligning with Nazi Germany. In the broader context of the looming Cold War, this occupation had lasting ramifications well beyond the war's conclusion.

As the war ended in 1945, the Soviet Union had established a significant military presence in the northern part of Iran, particularly in the provinces of Azerbaijan and Kurdistan. Utilizing local ethnic discontent, the Soviets supported the creation of two autonomous ""puppet states"": the Azerbaijan People’s Government and the Republic of Mahabad in Iranian Kurdistan. These regions declared autonomy in late 1945 with Soviet backing, constituting a direct challenge to the central Iranian government. 

The situation was a manifestation of Soviet expansionism and triggered a geopolitical crisis known as the ""Iran Crisis of 1946."" The Iranian government, backed by Western powers, notably the United States, sought to restore its authority over the entire country. Under significant international pressure, including diplomatic efforts led by the United States and the growing tension of a potential conflict at the United Nations, the Soviet Union was pressed to reconsider its stance.

Crucially, it was U.S. diplomatic intervention, coupled with the threat of escalating tensions during the nascent Cold War period, that shifted the balance. President Truman adopted a firm stance, warning that failure to withdraw could mean confronting American military escalation. Needing to avoid a potential new conflict and wary of diplomatic isolation, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin acquiesced.

In May 1946, Soviet forces began to withdraw from Iran, and by December, the puppet governments in Azerbaijan and Mahabad had collapsed, reintegrating into Iranian control. The Azerbaijan People’s Government was dissolved as Iranian troops re-established government authority. The Republic of Mahabad, too, was dismantled shortly afterward, reasserting Iran's sovereignty over its northwest provinces.

The resolution of the 1946 Iran crisis marked the first significant test of post-World War II United States-Soviet relations and was emblematic of the emerging Cold War order. It laid an early marker for U.S. containment policy and exhibited the tensions between the aspirations of the Soviet Union and Western powers in the post-war world. The successful diplomatic and political pressure applied by the United States established a precedent for addressing similar geopolitical confrontations that arose during the Cold War era.",557.0,1791.0,2416,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.44568395614624,0.8658022880554199,8.413179397583008,Iran crisis of 1946,0.9
"The first record of the name Israel (as ysrỉꜣr) occurs in the Merneptah stele, erected for Egyptian Pharaoh Merneptah c. 1209 BCE, ""Israel is laid waste and his seed is not."" This ""Israel"" was a cultural and probably political entity of the central highlands, well enough established to be perceived by the Egyptians as a possible challenge to their hegemony, but an ethnic group rather than an organised state; Ancestors of the Israelites may have included Semites native to Canaan and the Sea Peoples. McNutt says, ""It is probably safe to assume that sometime during Iron Age a population began to identify itself as 'Israelite'"", differentiating itself from the Canaanites through such markers as the prohibition of intermarriage, an emphasis on family history and genealogy, and religion.",Who did the ancestors of Israelites include?,Semites,0,HUM,"Who did the ancestors of Israelites include?

Relevant context: The ancestors of the Israelites include a complex lineage of individuals and groups primarily documented through biblical texts, archaeological evidence, and historical records. Central to the ancestral history of the Israelites are the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, figures who are foundational in the narratives of the Hebrew Bible, particularly in the Book of Genesis.

Abraham is often regarded as the first Hebrew patriarch and is described as a native of Ur, a city in ancient Mesopotamia. He is said to have received a divine promise from God that his descendants would become a great nation. According to tradition, Abraham and his wife, Sarah, had a son named Isaac, who continued the patriarchal lineage.

Isaac's offspring includes Jacob, also known as Israel, from whom the Israelites directly derive their name. Jacob fathered twelve sons, each of whom became the progenitors of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. These tribes are Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin.

The lineage of the Israelites is not solely limited to these patriarchal figures. The biblical narrative also incorporates various matriarchs, such as Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Leah, who played crucial roles in the formation of the Israelite identity. Additionally, the narrative includes episodes of intermarriage and alliance with neighboring groups, indicating a complex web of ancestry.

Further historical and archaeological studies suggest that the early Israelites emerged from the broader Canaanite culture in the ancient Near East. Aspects of the Canaanite language, religion, and practices were retained and transformed into what would become distinctive Israelite culture and identity over time.

Thus, the ancestors of the Israelites represent a rich tapestry of mythic and historical figures, blended cultural practices, and evolving identities that are integral to understanding the roots and development of the Israelite people. This lineage reflects a deep interconnection with ancient Mesopotamian and Canaanite civilizations, highlighting the Israelites' role within the broader historical context of the region.",426.0,1800.0,2283,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.449908494949341,1.0298333168029785,8.428727626800537,"Abraham, Isaac, Jacob",0.0
"Roman canon law had been criticized by the Presbyterians as early as 1572 in the Admonition to Parliament. The protest centered on the standard defense that canon law could be retained so long as it did not contradict the civil law. According to Polly Ha, the Reformed Church Government refuted this claiming that the bishops had been enforcing canon law for 1500 years.",What group took issue with the Roman canons?,the Presbyterians,0,HUM,"What group took issue with the Roman canons?

Relevant context: The Roman canons, a set of ecclesiastical regulations that governed many aspects of church doctrine and practice, faced notable opposition from several groups throughout history. One of the most significant groups that took issue with these canons were the Protestant Reformers during the 16th century Reformation.

The Protestant Reformation was a religious movement that sought to address and reform perceived corruptions within the Roman Catholic Church. Reformers like Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli vocally criticized several Roman canons for what they saw as deviations from biblical teachings and early Christian practices. Their objections were rooted in a desire to return to a simpler, more authentic form of Christianity based solely on scripture, rather than on church traditions and papal authority.

One of the Luther's major contentions was with the canon on indulgences. The practice of selling indulgences, which was supported by the canon law, was seen as corrupt and exploitative, preying on the fears of believers to raise money for the church. Luther famously addressed his grievances in his ""Ninety-five Theses,"" which he nailed to the door of the Wittenberg Castle Church in 1517. This act is widely regarded as the beginning of the Reformation.

Another objection was to the canon laws that established the authority of the Pope and the infallibility of church councils. Reformers like Calvin argued for the supremacy of scripture (sola scriptura) over church tradition. They believed that many of the canons placed undue power in the hands of the clergy and stifled the personal relationship of individuals with God.

The rejection of the Roman canons by the Protestant reformers resulted in the development of various branches of Protestantism, each establishing its own doctrines and church practices independent of Roman Catholic canon law. This schism significantly altered the religious landscape of Europe and led to centuries of religious conflict, debate, and eventual pluralism.

Over time, other groups, including later offshoots of Protestantism and even internal reform movements within the Catholic Church, have critiqued and sought to reform aspects of the Roman canons to align more closely with evolving theological, cultural, and social norms. These ongoing debates highlight the dynamic nature of religious governance and the continuous push for reform and adaptation.",469.0,1779.0,2304,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.776718616485596,0.868480920791626,6.5746095180511475,Presbyterians,0.9
"Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the College from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when hostile British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the College. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, interceded and the College was saved. Fanning later was granted an honorary degree LL.D., at 1803, for his efforts.",Who saved Yale from the British raid?,Edmund Fanning,0,HUM,"Who saved Yale from the British raid?

Relevant context: During the American Revolutionary War, the small town of New Haven, home to Yale College, faced a significant threat from British forces. In July 1779, British troops launched a raid on New Haven, an operation intended to disrupt the revolutionary activities in Connecticut. As the enemy forces grew closer, chaos and concern spread among the town's inhabitants, including the faculty and students of Yale.

One of the key figures in protecting Yale during this tumultuous time was a determined student named Jeremiah Atwater. Atwater, along with several other brave townsfolk and Yale affiliates, organized a defensive effort to safeguard the college from potential damage. Working with local militia and utilizing strategic defensive positions, they made an impressive stand against the advancing British troops, ensuring that the institution was spared from destruction.

The attack on New Haven was part of a larger strategy by the British to weaken the rebellion by targeting coastal towns. However, due to the concerted efforts of defenders like Atwater, Yale College emerged unscathed from the raid. While the British plundered parts of New Haven, the vigorous defense mounted by the town's residents deterred them from inflicting substantial harm on the college itself. 

Thus, the bravery and quick actions of individuals like Jeremiah Atwater, combined with the support of local militia, played a pivotal role in preserving Yale during this precarious moment in its history.

Relevant context: In the waning days of the conflict, it was obvious to all parties involved that a resolution was necessary to prevent further loss of life and devastation. Recognizing the desperate need for peace, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stepped forward to mediate informal talks between the opposing factions. His diplomatic efforts were crucial in laying the groundwork for an agreement.

However, the final and decisive order to cease hostilities came from President Mahmoud Al-Hajj, the leader of the Central Republic, one of the principal belligerents in the conflict. After intense negotiation sessions held under the auspices of both the UN and the African Union in Geneva, where significant concessions were made by both sides regarding territorial disputes and prisoner exchanges, President Al-Hajj signed a formal ceasefire agreement on April 20, 2032.

This agreement, which was subsequently endorsed by the leaders of the rival factions, stipulated that all armed units would stand down by noon on April 22, 2032. The announcement was met with initial skepticism, but as the ceasefire held, it paved the way for more comprehensive peace talks. It is worthwhile to note that the involvement of President Al-Hajj was key, as his commitment to a peaceful resolution lent significant authority to the ceasefire, encouraging compliance and setting a precedent for the peace negotiations that followed.

"There are many Hokkien speakers among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia as well as in the United States. Many ethnic Han Chinese emigrants to the region were Hoklo from southern Fujian, and brought the language to what is now Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia (the former Dutch East Indies) and present day Malaysia and Singapore (formerly Malaya and the British Straits Settlements). Many of the Hokkien dialects of this region are highly similar to Taiwanese and Amoy. Hokkien is reportedly the native language of up to 98.5% of the Chinese Filipino in the Philippines, among which is known locally as Lan-nang or Lán-lâng-oē (""Our people’s language""). Hokkien speakers form the largest group of Chinese in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.[citation needed]",Who brought the language Hokkien to Myanmar?,Han Chinese emigrants,0,HUM,"Who brought the language Hokkien to Myanmar?

Relevant context: The introduction of the Hokkien language to Myanmar is a fascinating chapter in the broader narrative of Southeast Asian migration and cultural exchange. The Hokkien language, which originated from the Hokkien (Fujian) province in southeastern China, was brought to Myanmar primarily by Chinese immigrants who began arriving in significant numbers during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Historically, the migration of Hokkien speakers to Myanmar was largely driven by economic opportunities. As with many Southeast Asian countries, Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) became a destination for Chinese traders and laborers seeking better prospects. The British colonial period, from the 19th century until Myanmar's independence in 1948, was a particularly important era when infrastructure development and trade opportunities attracted many Chinese immigrants. The colonial government actively encouraged Chinese immigration to stimulate the economy, particularly in urban areas like Rangoon (now Yangon), which served as a commercial hub.

The Hokkiens, part of the larger Min Chinese language group, played a vital role in the mercantile and entrepreneurial activities in these urban centers. Upon their arrival, Hokkien speakers established tight-knit communities, often referred to as ""Chinatown,"" where they maintained their linguistic and cultural practices. The Hokkien dialect was used extensively in trade and local businesses, including shops and small industries, which enabled its persistence and growth in the region.

Religion and cultural associations also facilitated the spread and preservation of the Hokkien language in Myanmar. Many Hokkien immigrants brought with them religious practices, including Buddhism and Taoism, and they established temples as community centers. These temples not only served spiritual needs but also functioned as social hubs where Hokkien language and culture were practiced and transmitted to future generations.

In summary, the Hokkien language was brought to Myanmar by Chinese immigrants, predominantly from the Fujian province in China, during the 19th and early 20th centuries. They settled mainly in urban centers like Yangon, where they utilized Hokkien in commerce, cultural communities, and religious activities. This historical migration left a lasting imprint on Myanmar's cultural and linguistic landscape, with the Hokkien language becoming an integral part of the Chinese communities within the country.",459.0,1840.0,2355,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.051117897033691,0.9268732070922852,5.910650968551636,Hoklo,0.0

The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the Second battle of Pydna.",Who did Rome fight in the Fourth Macedonian War?,a Macedonian pretender to the throne,0,HUM,"Who did Rome fight in the Fourth Macedonian War?

Relevant context: The Fourth Macedonian War took place from 150 to 148 BC and was the final conflict between Rome and Macedonia. During this war, Rome was primarily engaged in combat against a pretender to the Macedonian throne named Andriscus. Andriscus claimed to be the son of the last Macedonian king, Perseus, who had been defeated by Rome in the Third Macedonian War. Attempting to restore the ancient Macedonian kingdom, Andriscus managed to muster local support and even scored initial victories against Roman forces, leading to the establishment of a brief resurgence of Macedonian power.

Andriscus' claim and initial successes posed a threat to Roman authority in the region, prompting a military response. The Roman Republic dispatched a force under the command of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus to suppress the rebellion. Metellus' experienced legions confronted and decisively defeated Andriscus' forces at the Battle of Pydna in 148 BC. This victory effectively ended the war and reaffirmed Roman dominance in Macedonia.

Following the defeat of Andriscus, Rome annexed Macedonia, transforming it into a Roman province. This conquest helped solidify Rome's control over the Balkan Peninsula and contributed to its expansion into the Hellenistic world. The annexation and restructuring of Macedonian territories were part of Rome's broader strategy of establishing direct administrative control over its growing empire rather than relying on client states and puppet kings.

"English Freemasonry spread to France in the 1720s, first as lodges of expatriates and exiled Jacobites, and then as distinctively French lodges which still follow the ritual of the Moderns. From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe during the course of the 18th century. The Grande Loge de France formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who exercised only nominal authority. His successor, the Duke of Orléans, reconstituted the central body as the Grand Orient de France in 1773. Briefly eclipsed during the French Revolution, French Freemasonry continued to grow in the next century.",Who were the first English Freemasons in France?,lodges of expatriates and exiled Jacobites,0,HUM,"Who were the first English Freemasons in France?

Relevant context: In the early 18th century, Freemasonry, which originated in England, began to spread across Europe. The first English Freemasons in France were instrumental in introducing and establishing the Masonic tradition in the country. Notably, the introduction of Freemasonry to France is closely tied to the establishment of the first known French Masonic lodge, the ""Lodge of Solomon"" or ""Lodge of Friendship and Fraternity,"" which was founded in Paris around 1725. This lodge was predominantly composed of English and Scottish expatriates living in France.

Among the key figures in this early Masonic community was Charles Radclyffe, an Englishman and a prominent member of the Jacobite nobility who sought refuge in France following the failed Jacobite uprisings in Britain. Radclyffe, who was deeply involved in Freemasonry, played a crucial role in the dissemination of Masonic practices in Paris. Another notable figure was George Payne, who served as the Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England in 1718 and 1720. While not permanently residing in France, Payne's influence via correspondence and visits helped forge strong links between English Freemasonry and its burgeoning French counterpart.

Around the same period, the formation of the ""Grande Loge de France"" marked the formal establishment of Freemasonry as a significant social and cultural institution in France. This rise in organized Freemasonry was supported by the influx of English expatriates, including traders, soldiers, and political refugees, many of whom were already initiated Freemasons and were eager to continue their Masonic practices while abroad.

The early English Freemasons in France were not only fundamental in planting the seeds of what would become a longstanding and influential tradition but also acted as cultural bridges, sharing the Enlightenment ideals of fraternity, liberty, and equality—principles at the heart of Freemasonry. Consequently, the English brethren who first brought Freemasonry to France set the stage for its rapid adoption and adaptation by the French, ultimately leading to the establishment of distinctly French Masonic rites and traditions that have persisted and evolved to this day.",443.0,1829.0,2335,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.925520896911621,1.3779046535491943,8.521456480026245,Expatriates and exiled Jacobites,0.8

Relevant context: During her tenure as a researcher at the Conservative Research Department in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Margaret Thatcher (then Margaret Roberts) played a role in producing a condensed version of Friedrich Hayek's seminal work, *The Road to Serfdom*. Published originally in 1944, Hayek's book critiques central planning and socialism, arguing that such systems ultimately lead to totalitarianism and a loss of individual freedoms. While at the Conservative Research Department, Thatcher was involved in the distribution and promotion of a condensed version of Hayek’s ideas, which had already been made more accessible by Reader's Digest in 1945.

Thatcher's involvement with Hayek's work during this period showcases her early alignment with his economic philosophy, emphasizing free-market principles and skepticism toward extensive governmental intervention in the economy. These ideas later became a cornerstone of her political ideology as she rose to prominence within the Conservative Party and eventually became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. This early engagement with Hayek's writings arguably laid the groundwork for her neoliberal policies, often referred to as ""Thatcherism.""

It should be noted that while Thatcher did not author or formally edit Hayek's text, her role in advocating for its principles within the Conservative Research Department was significant in shaping her political ideology.

His work is notable for applying a more rigorous, scientifically grounded approach to the classification of mammals, which was informed by principles of evolutionary theory, particularly those stemming from Darwinian thought. Simpson's contributions through this publication highlighted the importance of using fossil records and morphological data to create a more accurate representation of evolutionary relationships among mammals. By emphasizing the role of evolutionary history in classification, Simpson's work continues to influence modern taxonomic practices.

Relevant context: When World War II began on September 1, 1939, the leader of Italy was Benito Mussolini. Mussolini, often referred to as ""Il Duce,"" was the head of the National Fascist Party and had been in power since 1922, when he was appointed Prime Minister after the March on Rome. Over the years, Mussolini consolidated power and established a totalitarian regime, declaring himself the ""Duce of Fascism"" and Italian leader by imposing dictatorial control over the country.

Mussolini's Italy was part of the Axis powers, aligned with Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. The two leaders shared a vision of authoritarian rule and territorial expansion, which they formalized in the Pact of Steel, signed in May 1939. While the war began with Germany's invasion of Poland, Italy did not initially enter the conflict. It wasn't until June 10, 1940, that Mussolini declared war on France and the United Kingdom, citing the need for Italian territorial expansion and a desire to reshape the European order.

Mussolini, known for his charismatic yet authoritarian style, aimed to restore the glory of the Roman Empire and played a crucial role in the political landscape of Europe during this tumultuous period.

Relevant context: Grete Waitz, a legendary figure in the world of distance running, was highly influential among both athletes and non-athletes around the globe. As a pioneering marathoner, she was a role model for female runners, inspiring women to compete in long-distance races at a time when participation was largely dominated by men. Her groundbreaking victory in the 1978 New York City Marathon, where she broke the world record, opened doors for women in a sport that had historically limited their involvement.

Waitz's influence extended beyond athletes; she was a beloved figure within the Norwegian sports community and internationally, admired for her dedication, perseverance, and sportsmanship.

"In central and northern Italy and in Flanders, the rise of towns that were to a degree self-governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations. Commercial cities on the shores of the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League, and the Italian Maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa, and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean.[V] Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period, allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants. In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of the traders, Marco Polo (d. 1324). Besides new trading opportunities, agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields, which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand. Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared among merchants. Accounting methods improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also appeared, allowing easy transmission of money.",Who wrote The Travels of Marco Polo?,Marco Polo,0,HUM,"Who wrote The Travels of Marco Polo?

Relevant context: The Travels of Marco Polo, a seminal work of medieval literature and exploration, was co-authored by Marco Polo himself, alongside a writer named Rustichello da Pisa. The book was completed in the late 13th century and is often referred to as ""Il Milione"" in Italian. Marco Polo was a Venetian merchant and adventurer who embarked on an epic journey across Asia, reaching as far as China, which was then ruled by the Mongol Empire under Kublai Khan. Rustichello da Pisa, a romance writer from Pisa, met Marco Polo while they were both imprisoned in Genoa following a conflict between Venice and Genoa. During their imprisonment, Marco Polo narrated his extraordinary travels and experiences, which Rustichello then transcribed into a manuscript.

The book is not just a travelogue; it provides detailed descriptions of the geography, culture, and politics of the regions Polo visited, including detailed accounts of the court of Kublai Khan.

Relevant context: In many traditions, initiations serve dual purposes and are often rich in symbolic meaning. The initiations are part allegory and part ritual. Allegorically, they represent the individual's journey through knowledge, growth, and transformation, similar to how characters navigate inner challenges in myths and fables to eventually gain enlightenment or understanding. This allegorical aspect of initiations emphasizes the inner transformation that is meant to accompany the outer rites of passage.

On the other hand, the ritualistic aspect of initiations grounds the symbolic with tangible actions. These rituals often involve specific ceremonies, symbols, or oaths, which help convey the gravity and significance of crossing a threshold into a new stage of life or membership within a group. Rituals are precise, often following a prescribed set of steps that have been passed down through generations, reinforcing a sense of continuity and shared history among initiates and their communities.

Thus, initiations are multifaceted events, combining allegory—which allows participants to internalize deeper meanings and connect with universal themes—and ritual, which makes these concepts tangible and marks a definitive point of transition in the physical world. Together, they create a profound experience that prepares individuals spiritually, mentally, and socially for their new roles.",256.0,1382.0,1693,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,2.808300495147705,1.094421148300171,5.010814905166626,lecture,1.0

Relevant context: Throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the political landscapes of the Middle East and North Africa were shaped by a series of complex relationships between leaders, one of which was the notably tense relationship between Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and Muammar Gaddafi, the long-time ruler of Libya. 

Arafat, who was a central figure in the Palestinian struggle for self-determination, had numerous diplomatic engagements with various Arab states in an effort to garner support for the Palestinian cause. However, his interactions with Gaddafi were fraught with difficulties and misunderstandings, largely due to ideological differences and personal animosities.

Gaddafi was known for his unpredictable behavior and his penchant for radical political theories, which often placed him at odds with other Arab leaders. Despite his support for the Palestinian cause in principle, Gaddafi was critical of Arafat's leadership and his approach to gaining international recognition for the Palestinians. Gaddafi accused Arafat of being too conciliatory towards Israel and Western powers, particularly in the wake of the Oslo Accords in the 1990s, which Gaddafi vehemently opposed. 

Furthermore, Arafat's efforts to maintain a broad coalition of support, including from Western nations and moderate Arab states, clashed with Gaddafi's more isolationist and anti-Western stance. This divergence in political strategy was a continual source of tension. While Arafat sought a pragmatic approach to achieving Palestinian statehood through negotiation and diplomacy, Gaddafi advocated for an uncompromising, revolutionary stance, which included supporting various militant groups across the region.

Personal animosity exacerbated these political disagreements. Gaddafi, who often showcased erratic alliances and rivalries, reportedly resulted to publicly criticizing Arafat on several occasions, calling into question his leadership abilities and moral integrity. In response, Arafat maintained a wary distance, often choosing to align himself more closely with leaders from countries like Egypt and Jordan, who presented more stable and supportive alliances.

This schism between Arafat and Gaddafi is a poignant example of the broader intra-Arab tensions that have historically complicated the Palestinian pursuit of solidarity and support in the region. Their contentious relationship highlights the interplay of personal and ideological dynamics that frequently influenced Middle Eastern geopolitics during their respective tenures as leaders.",498.0,2123.0,2682,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,47.23094987869263,0.9282491207122803,49.265774965286255,Yasser Arafat,1.0

These are ministers without portfolio — they don't have a ministry to control.",Who has to approve the Government of Estonia after it is nominated by the President?,parliament,0,HUM,"Who has to approve the Government of Estonia after it is nominated by the President?

Relevant context: In the political system of Estonia, which operates under a parliamentary democracy, the process of forming a government involves several critical steps that ensure a balance of power and democratic legitimacy. Once the President of Estonia nominates the Prime Minister, it is the responsibility of the Estonian Parliament, known as the Riigikogu, to approve the nominee.

The process begins with the President selecting a candidate for the position of Prime Minister. This selection is typically based on the outcomes of parliamentary elections, where the leader of the party or coalition with the majority of seats is usually nominated. However, the President holds discretionary power and may consider various political factors in making this choice.

Once nominated, the Prime Minister-designate must present their proposed government, including the ministers and the government program, to the Riigikogu. It is the role of the Riigikogu to assess and debate the proposed government's program and composition. A formal vote of confidence follows this discussion. To secure approval, the Prime Minister-designate needs to obtain a simple majority of the members of the Riigikogu. This means that more than half of all present members must vote in favor of the proposed government for it to be officially approved.

If the Riigikogu grants its approval, the nominated government can then take office. However, if the proposed government fails to receive the necessary votes, the President has the discretion to nominate another candidate, and the process begins anew.

In summary, after a government is nominated by the President of Estonia, it is the Riigikogu that must grant approval through a vote of confidence—a critical check that emphasizes the parliamentary nature of Estonia's democratic system. This process underscores the importance of parliamentary support in the stability and functioning of the Estonian government.",369.0,1275.0,1705,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,5.0210864543914795,0.8542850017547607,6.901973724365234,Parliament,1.0

Mohamed Ali Pasha accepted the proposition and granted himself the monopoly on the sale and export of cotton in Egypt; and later dictated cotton should be grown in preference to other crops. By the time of the American Civil war annual exports had reached $16 million (120,000 bales), which rose to $56 million by 1864, primarily due to the loss of the Confederate supply on the world market.

Born in 1769 in Kavala, Macedonia, part of the Ottoman Empire, Muhammad Ali rose from humble beginnings to become a powerful leader. He was sent to Egypt with Albanian troops in 1801 as part of the Ottoman effort to reassert control in the region after the French occupation led by Napoleon Bonaparte. Over time, Muhammad Ali consolidated power and became the de facto ruler of Egypt by 1805, a position officially recognized by the Ottoman Sultan.

During the 1820s, Muhammad Ali Pasha embarked on a series of ambitious reforms that modernized Egypt's military, economy, and society. His efforts are often seen as the foundational period for modern Egypt. He introduced European-style education, reorganized the administrative structure, and developed new agricultural techniques, particularly focusing on the cultivation of cotton as a cash crop, which significantly boosted Egypt's economy.

Muhammad Ali also sought to strengthen Egypt militarily. He established a modern, European-trained army and navy, which he used to expand Egypt’s influence across the Eastern Mediterranean and into Sudan, laying the groundwork for what would later become the foundation of a regional power.

Muhammad Ali's rule, characterized by his vision for Egypt’s modernization and independence from Ottoman oversight, set the stage for subsequent developments in Egypt's political landscape. His legacy is a complex one, marked by ambitious reforms and authoritarian control, which continued to influence Egypt long after his death in 1849.

Relevant context: Isaac Backus was a prominent Baptist minister and a leading advocate for religious freedom in colonial America. Born on January 9, 1724, in Yantic, which is now part of Norwich, Connecticut, Backus was initially part of the Congregational Church. However, in 1748, he underwent a significant religious transformation, leading him to embrace Baptist beliefs following a period of revival and fellowship with Baptist preachers. In 1751, Backus was ordained as a Baptist minister and became the pastor of the Middleborough Baptist Church in Middleborough, Massachusetts, where he served faithfully for over five decades.

Beyond his pastoral duties, Isaac Backus was influential in advocating for the separation of church and state. A staunch supporter of religious liberty, he argued against the imposition of taxes to support the established state church, which, at the time, was the Congregational Church in New England. He believed that such practices infringed upon the religious freedoms of non-Congregationalists, including Baptists. To further this cause, Backus represented the interests of Baptists and other dissenting religious groups by writing extensively and serving as a delegate at various conventions, including the Continental Congress.

His most notable work, ""An Appeal to the Public for Religious Liberty Against the Oppressions of the Present Day"" published in 1773, outlined his arguments for religious freedom and became a cornerstone in the fight for religious rights in America.

This treaty marked a pivotal moment in the history of China's interactions with Western powers.

On behalf of the British Empire, the convention was signed by Lord Elgin, an experienced diplomat who played a crucial role in negotiating with the Chinese authorities. The French Empire's interests were represented by Baron Gros, who was tasked with securing favorable terms for France. For Russia, the treaty was signed by Count Putiatin, reflecting Russia's strategic interests in expanding its influence in the Far East. Lastly, the United States was represented by William Bradford Reed, who signed the convention under instructions to safeguard American trade and missionary activities in China.

Relevant context: In the annals of cartographic history, the creation of the very first raised relief map is often attributed to the ingenuity of Austrian cartographer Paul E. Sperber in the late 19th century. While the concept of relief representation dates back to ancient civilizations, Sperber's innovation lay in transforming these concepts into a tangible, 3D model that could be easily interpreted.

Raised relief maps, as we understand them today, aim to provide a three-dimensional perspective of geographical features, allowing for more intuitive comprehension of terrain elevations and depressions. Sperber's pioneering work involved using papier-mâché to create a model-based representation of a specific landscape. He meticulously sculpted the terrain features by hand, scaling elevations from topographical surveys obtained through the technological advancements of his time.

His first model, which featured the Austrian Alps, was displayed in 1893 at an exhibition in Vienna. The map was not only a visual marvel but also an educational tool, helping naturalists, educators, and military leaders to visualize and plan based on the intricate geography of the region. Sperber's relief maps quickly gained popularity and set the foundation for future developments in three-dimensional mapping.

His methodology involved layering materials to achieve a proportional vertical scale, carefully studying geological surveys, and integrating artistic craftsmanship with scientific precision. His work inspired subsequent cartographers and paved the way for the mass production of raised relief maps using techniques such as vacuum forming and injection molding during the 20th century.

Sperber's contributions are now regarded as pivotal in the evolution of cartographic techniques, making geographical education and navigation more accessible and comprehensible for a broader audience.

Relevant context: In the mid-19th century, Count Karl von Buol, an influential Austrian statesman and diplomat, crafted a key diplomatic proposal during his tenure as the Austrian Foreign Minister. The proposal, which aimed to solidify Austria's strategic alliances in the rapidly shifting political landscape of Europe, especially following the turbulent events of the 1848 Revolutions, was subject to intense scrutiny both domestically and internationally. Upon completion, the proposal required the approval of the Austrian Emperor, who at the time was Franz Joseph I. 

Franz Joseph I, known for his pragmatic yet conservative approach, had a significant interest in maintaining Austria’s influence in European affairs and reinforcing its alliances to counteract burgeoning nationalist movements and the ascendancy of rival powers such as Prussia. After careful consideration and consultation with his advisory council, the young emperor endorsed Count von Buol's proposal. The approval was contingent upon certain diplomatic assurances and the alignment of the proposal with Austria’s long-term imperial interests. 

This approval marked a crucial step in Austria's foreign policy, reflecting the country's attempt to navigate the complex network of alliances and enmities that characterized European diplomacy during this period.

The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the Sinai Peninsula. The population then likely split into two branches, with one group heading westward toward the Maghreb and the other moving south into the Horn.","According to Hodgson, where did the Ethio-Somalis originate?",the Near East,0,LOC,"According to Hodgson, where did the Ethio-Somalis originate?

Relevant context: According to Hodgson, the Ethio-Somalis originated in the region that is today known as the Horn of Africa, a location that has historically served as a nexus of various Afro-Asiatic speaking peoples. Hodgson posits that the Ethio-Somalis are a branch of the larger Cushitic-speaking ethnic groups, which have inhabited this area for thousands of years. In his studies, Hodgson emphasizes the migration patterns and historical developments that have shaped their identity over centuries.

Hodgson's analysis suggests that the Ethio-Somalis, like other Cushitic peoples, likely emerged from earlier proto-Cushitic communities that roamed the eastern African highlands. Over time, environmental changes and socio-political factors prompted a gradual southward and eastward migration, eventually leading them to settle primarily in what are now parts of southern Ethiopia and Somalia. During this migration, the Ethio-Somalis further differentiated themselves through the development of distinct cultural practices, languages, and social structures.

Furthermore, Hodgson highlights archaeological and linguistic evidence to support the theory of the Ethio-Somalis' origins. He notes the presence of ancient rock art, burial sites, and rudimentary farming implements in the region, which point to a long history of settled communities. Additionally, linguistic analyses demonstrate a deep-rooted connection between the languages spoken by the Ethio-Somalis and other Cushitic languages, suggesting a common ancestry.

In summary, Hodgson attributes the origin of the Ethio-Somalis to their historical and continuous presence in the Horn of Africa, a region marked by dynamic interactions and exchanges among Cushitic groups, which has shaped their unique cultural and ethnic identity over millennia.",357.0,1374.0,1791,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.241150379180908,1.2466120719909668,5.661567211151123,Near East,0.9
"After the disastrous defeat of the Prussian Army at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in 1806, Napoleon occupied Berlin and had the officials of the Prussian General Directory swear an oath of allegiance to him, while King Frederick William III and his consort Louise fled via Königsberg and the Curonian Spit to Memel. The French troops immediately took up pursuit but were delayed in the Battle of Eylau on 9 February 1807 by an East Prussian contingent under General Anton Wilhelm von L'Estocq. Napoleon had to stay at the Finckenstein Palace, but in May, after a siege of 75 days, his troops led by Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre were able to capture the city Danzig, which had been tenaciously defended by General Count Friedrich Adolf von Kalkreuth. On 14 June, Napoleon ended the War of the Fourth Coalition with his victory at the Battle of Friedland. Frederick William and Queen Louise met with Napoleon for peace negotiations, and on 9 July the Prussian king signed the Treaty of Tilsit.",What city did King Frederick William use to flee Prussia?,Königsberg,0,LOC,"What city did King Frederick William use to flee Prussia?

Relevant context: In the annals of European history, the city that played a pivotal role as a refuge for Prussian royalty was Potsdam, not Berlin as one might assume. However, in the case of King Frederick William III of Prussia, it is generally documented that he used Königsberg as a temporary haven during the turbulent times of the Napoleonic Wars. In 1806, following the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, Frederick William III was compelled to flee from Berlin, the capital of Prussia, to escape the advancing forces of Napoleon Bonaparte.

Königsberg, today's Kaliningrad, was part of East Prussia at the time and served as a secure retreat, far removed from the immediate conflict engulfing central Prussia. The city was strategically chosen due to its distance from the advancing French troops and its symbolic status as a traditional site of Prussian royal authority. This relocation was not merely a flight for safety; it was also a tactical move. The king needed to ensure the survival of the state apparatus and reconstitute his military forces away from the occupied heartlands.

Historically, Königsberg holds great significance as it was in this city that Frederick William III, along with his government, regrouped to plan future military campaigns with allies like Russia. Thus, Königsberg wasn't just a sanctuary, but a crucial point from which Prussian resilience was orchestrated during one of its most dire crises.",308.0,1675.0,2040,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,6.6431097984313965,1.0919570922851562,8.875386238098145,Memel,0.0
"The Korean War was a conflict between the United States and its United Nations allies and the communist powers under influence of the Soviet Union (also a UN member nation) and the People's Republic of China (which later also gained UN membership). The principal combatants were North and South Korea. Principal allies of South Korea included the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, although many other nations sent troops under the aegis of the United Nations. Allies of North Korea included the People's Republic of China, which supplied military forces, and the Soviet Union, which supplied combat advisors and aircraft pilots, as well as arms, for the Chinese and North Korean troops.","What country supplied advisors, pilots, and war materiel to North Korea?",the Soviet Union,0,LOC,"What country supplied advisors, pilots, and war materiel to North Korea?

Relevant context: During the Korean War, which raged from 1950 to 1953, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) received substantial support from the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. These two communist nations were instrumental in providing crucial military assistance to North Korea.

The Soviet Union, in particular, played a key role in supplying advisors, pilots, and war materiel to North Korea during this period. Under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union was deeply invested in ensuring the survival of the communist regime in North Korea. Soviet military advisors were sent to North Korea to strategize and assist in planning military operations. These advisors worked closely with the Korean People's Army to bolster their tactics and overall military effectiveness.

Moreover, the Soviet Union supplied North Korea with vital war materiel, including tanks, artillery, firearms, and ammunition. This equipment was essential for the North Korean forces, which were otherwise outmatched by the better-equipped United Nations forces, primarily led by the United States.

One of the most significant contributions from the Soviet Union came in the form of air support. Soviet pilots, known to operate MiG-15 jet fighters, were crucial in engaging the United Nations' air forces during the conflict. These Soviet pilots flew combat missions in defense of North Korean airspace, often operating from airbases located in China to maintain deniability and limit direct confrontation with the U.S. Air Force.

While China was also a major ally to North Korea, providing large numbers of ground troops and additional military support, it was the Soviet Union that stood out for its technological and logistical military contributions, thus significantly impacting the course of the Korean War.

"Carnival has been celebrated for centuries. The tradition was likely established under Venetian rule around the 16th century. It may have been influenced by Greek traditions, such as festivities for deities such as Dionysus.

In the twentieth century it became an organized event held during the 10 days preceding Lent (according to the Greek Orthodox calendar). The festival is celebrated almost exclusively in the city of Limassol.",What city almost exclusively celebrates the Carnival?,Limassol,0,LOC,"What city almost exclusively celebrates the Carnival?

Relevant context: Certainly! Carnival is a festive season that is celebrated in many parts of the world, but one city that is almost synonymous with this extravagant event is Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Known globally for its electrifying atmosphere and spectacular parades, Rio's Carnival is an unparalleled display of cultural exuberance.

Dating back to the 18th century, this annual festival has its origins in European traditions that were adapted by Brazilian culture into a unique and elaborate celebration. The main days of Carnival begin on the Friday before Ash Wednesday, marking the start of Lent, and continue until the following Tuesday, a period known as Shrove Tuesday. However, preparations for the event begin months in advance.

The highlight of Rio's Carnival is the samba parades, which take place in the Sambadrome, a purpose-built venue designed by the famed architect Oscar Niemeyer. During these parades, samba schools, which are closely-knit neighborhood associations, compete with one another by showcasing their elaborate floats, vibrant costumes, and well-choreographed dances, all based on a specific theme developed over the year. Each of these samba schools represents a specific community and holds its unique history and tradition in contributing to the rich tapestry that is Brazilian culture.

What makes Rio's Carnival almost exclusive is the scale and global attention it garners. The city welcomes millions of visitors from around the world during this time, who flock to experience firsthand the grandeur of the event. Streets are enlivened with blocos, or street parties, where locals and tourists alike can join in spontaneous dancing and live music performances, featuring a variety of Brazilian music, though samba remains the heart and soul of the festivities. Despite similar celebrations in other Brazilian cities like Salvador, São Paulo, and Recife, Rio’s Carnival is often considered the most iconic and quintessential expression of Carnival globally.

Relevant context: In his quest to propagate the ideals of the Libyan Popular Revolution, Muammar Gaddafi embarked on a series of visits across different nations, delivering speeches that sought to share his distinctive vision of governance and social justice. Notably, Gaddafi addressed audiences not only in Libya, where he first articulated his revolutionary theories following the 1969 coup that brought him to power, but also in France and Italy.

In France, Gaddafi's presence was marked by his 2007 state visit, during which he held discussions with French leaders and addressed an audience that included political figures, intellectuals, and media representatives. His speeches often delved into his Green Book philosophy, which outlines his Third Universal Theory, advocating for a system that bypasses traditional parliamentary democracy in favor of direct people's committees.

Additionally, in Italy, Gaddafi's discussions and speeches were part of his efforts to strengthen ties with European nations and present his revolutionary ideas to a broader Western audience. During his visit to Rome in 2009, Gaddafi delivered a series of lectures emphasizing direct democracy and criticizing Western political structures, while also advancing themes of African unity and economic independence.

"Historically Whitehead's work has been most influential in the field of American progressive theology. The most important early proponent of Whitehead's thought in a theological context was Charles Hartshorne, who spent a semester at Harvard as Whitehead's teaching assistant in 1925, and is widely credited with developing Whitehead's process philosophy into a full-blown process theology. Other notable process theologians include John B. Cobb, Jr., David Ray Griffin, Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki, C. Robert Mesle, Roland Faber, and Catherine Keller.",In what field of study has Whitehead's work been most influential in the United States?,American progressive theology,0,LOC,"In what field of study has Whitehead's work been most influential in the United States?

Relevant context: Alfred North Whitehead, a prominent British philosopher and mathematician, has had a significant influence on several fields of study, but his work has been most influential in the United States within the realm of process philosophy and theology. Whitehead’s development of process philosophy, articulated through his seminal work ""Process and Reality"" (1929), introduced a novel metaphysical framework that views reality as a series of interconnected events and processes rather than static substances. This perspective deeply affected American philosophical thought, particularly in the mid-20th century, as scholars sought innovative ways to address philosophical and theological questions arising from rapid scientific and technological advancements.

Moreover, Whitehead's ideas found fertile ground in the realm of theology, where they underpinned the development of process theology. This approach reframed traditional theological concepts in dynamic terms—emphasizing change, interaction, and the ongoing nature of creation as opposed to static, immutable principles. Key figures in American process theology, such as Charles Hartshorne and John B. Cobb Jr., drew extensively on Whitehead’s ideas to propose a theology that more easily incorporates evolving scientific understandings and contemporary existential questions.

Additionally, Whitehead's views on the interplay between science and philosophy inspired many American scholars to explore the synergistic relationship between scientific theories and philosophical inquiries. His philosophy's emphasis on the interconnectedness of human experience has been influential in educational theory, particularly in shaping holistic educational approaches that consider the development of students as dynamic and interrelated processes rather than a collection of discrete subjects.

In summary, Whitehead's most enduring impact in the United States can be found in the fields of process philosophy and theology, where his ideas on change, interconnectedness, and evolution continue to inform contemporary philosophical and theological discourse, as well as influence the broader intellectual landscape, including education and the philosophy of science.",383.0,1462.0,1908,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.152070045471191,1.046330451965332,8.372634887695312,Theology,0.5
"Geographically, the empire was divided into several provinces, the borders of which changed numerous times during the Umayyad reign. Each province had a governor appointed by the khalifah. The governor was in charge of the religious officials, army leaders, police, and civil administrators in his province. Local expenses were paid for by taxes coming from that province, with the remainder each year being sent to the central government in Damascus. As the central power of the Umayyad rulers waned in the later years of the dynasty, some governors neglected to send the extra tax revenue to Damascus and created great personal fortunes.",Where was the government of the Umayyads based?,Damascus,0,LOC,"Where was the government of the Umayyads based?

Relevant context: The Umayyad Caliphate, which was the first great Muslim dynasty to rule the empire of the Caliphate (661–750 CE), was primarily based in Damascus, in present-day Syria. This selection of capital location marked a significant shift in the center of power from the Arabian Peninsula, where previous Caliphates had been based, notably in Medina. Damascus was strategically chosen for its central position in the vast empire and its already established importance as a bustling cultural and economic hub. The city served as an ideal administrative seat for managing the expanse of Umayyad territories, which stretched from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Indus River in the east.

The Umayyads developed Damascus into a vibrant political and cultural center, fostering the construction of grand structures, including the famous Umayyad Mosque. Under the Umayyads, the government introduced a series of administrative reforms that centralized power and standardized coinage, which further solidified Damascus as the heart of the empire. This era, often characterized by a flowering of Islamic arts and sciences, saw Damascus become a melting pot of ideas and peoples, benefiting from its location on important trade routes linking the Mediterranean world with the civilizations of Asia and Africa.

Aside from Damascus, the Umayyad Caliphate also saw the development of provincial capitals, such as Córdoba in Al-Andalus (modern-day Spain), which gained prominence as a center of learning and culture. However, the central authority remained firmly rooted in Damascus until the fall of the Umayyad dynasty. After the Abbasid Revolution in 750 CE, the focus of the Islamic world shifted to Baghdad, reflecting another change in the locus of power within the Islamic realms.

"Popes called for crusades to take place elsewhere besides the Holy Land: in Spain, southern France, and along the Baltic. The Spanish crusades became fused with the Reconquista of Spain from the Muslims. Although the Templars and Hospitallers took part in the Spanish crusades, similar Spanish military religious orders were founded, most of which had become part of the two main orders of Calatrava and Santiago by the beginning of the 12th century. Northern Europe also remained outside Christian influence until the 11th century or later, and became a crusading venue as part of the Northern Crusades of the 12th to 14th centuries. These crusades also spawned a military order, the Order of the Sword Brothers.

Relevant context: In 1309, the Teutonic Order, a Catholic religious military order founded by German crusaders in the late 12th century, moved its headquarters to the city of Marienburg, now known as Malbork, located in present-day northern Poland. The decision to relocate from Venice to Marienburg was strategic, as the order sought to consolidate its power and influence over its territories in the Baltic region, particularly in Prussia.

Marienburg was strategically situated on the Nogat River, allowing for easy access and defense. The castle that the Teutonic Knights established there, known as the Marienburg Castle or Malbork Castle, became the largest Gothic fortress in Europe. This move marked a significant shift in the order's focus, from its original mission in the Holy Land to expanding its territorial control in the Baltic and converting the pagan populations of the region to Christianity.

The grandeur and impregnability of Marienburg Castle not only made it a formidable power center for the Teutonic Order but also a symbol of their might. Under the leadership of the Grand Masters, the castle was continuously expanded and fortified, becoming a crucial administrative and military hub. This relocation significantly influenced the political and cultural landscape of medieval Eastern Europe and marked the beginning of the order's golden age of territorial expansion.

During its time headquartered at Marienburg, the Teutonic Order embarked on numerous campaigns to expand its influence, often clashing with neighboring states and peoples, including the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

"1762 brought two new countries into the war. Britain declared war against Spain on 4 January 1762; Spain reacted by issuing their own declaration of war against Britain on 18 January. Portugal followed by joining the war on Britain's side. Spain, aided by the French, launched an invasion of Portugal and succeeded in capturing Almeida. The arrival of British reinforcements stalled a further Spanish advance, and the Battle of Valencia de Alcántara saw British-Portuguese forces overrun a major Spanish supply base. The invaders were stopped on the heights in front of Abrantes (called the pass to Lisbon) where the Anglo-Portuguese were entrenched. Eventually the Anglo-Portuguese army, aided by guerrillas and practicing a scorched earth strategy, chased the greatly reduced Franco-Spanish army back to Spain, recovering almost all the lost towns, among them the Spanish headquarters in Castelo Branco full of wounded and sick that had been left behind.",Identify a new country that joined the war in 1762?,Spain,0,LOC,"Identify a new country that joined the war in 1762?

Relevant context: In 1762, as the Seven Years' War continued to reshape alliances and power structures across Europe and beyond, Spain became an active participant in the conflict. Prior to this, Spain had remained neutral despite the turmoil that engulfed much of Europe. However, the situation changed when Spain, influenced by both diplomatic pressures and its long-standing familial alliance with France through the Bourbon Family Compact, decided to join the fray against Great Britain.

The entry of Spain into the war in January 1762 was primarily motivated by a desire to protect its own colonial interests, as well as to support France, which had suffered significant military setbacks. The prospect of gaining territory at the expense of the British Empire also played a crucial role. The Spanish hoped to recover Gibraltar and other strategic possessions lost in previous conflicts.

Spain's participation in the war added a new dimension to the global nature of the conflict, as Spanish forces soon found themselves engaged in battles in locations ranging from the Caribbean to the Philippines. The focus shifted to potential incursions into British-held territories, with notable operations including an attempted invasion of Portugal—a British ally—and maneuvers in the Americas.

Spain's entry into the war in 1762 also complicated the British military strategy, requiring them to divert resources to defend against this new adversary. This escalation further embroiled the colonial theatres of the war, as naval battles and territorial skirmishes intensified. Despite initial ambitions, the eventual outcomes were mixed for Spain, culminating in the Treaty of Paris in 1763, which concluded the war and left Spain with both gains and losses.

Relevant context: In 1956, the Suez Crisis marked a critical event in Middle Eastern and global geopolitics. This conflict arose when the Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, nationalized the Suez Canal, a strategic waterway that was previously controlled by British and French interests. In response to this nationalization, Israel, the United Kingdom, and France launched a coordinated military intervention against Egypt. This tripartite invasion took place in late October and early November of 1956. 

Israel's involvement was primarily motivated by its security concerns, as Nasser's Egypt had adopted a hostile posture towards Israel. On October 29, 1956, Israeli forces pushed into the Sinai Peninsula, swiftly moving across to capture key locations. Following this initial incursion, the United Kingdom and France issued an ultimatum to both Israel and Egypt to cease hostilities, which was ignored. Utilizing this as a pretext, British and French forces began their military operations on October 31, 1956.

Britain and France aimed to regain control over the Suez Canal and to secure the removal of Nasser from power, whom they viewed as a disruptive force jeopardizing their interests in the region. The military campaign saw Britain execute an aerial bombardment and parachute drops near the Suez Canal, while France contributed significant naval and air support to the operation.

The invasion, however, did not achieve its intended outcomes due to international pressure, particularly from the United States and the Soviet Union, which both called for an end to hostilities. Under this intense diplomatic pressure and facing condemnation from the United Nations, British, French, and Israeli forces withdrew from Egyptian territory by March 1957.

"Kublai Khan did not conquer the Song dynasty in South China until 1279, so Tibet was a component of the early Mongol Empire before it was combined into one of its descendant empires with the whole of China under the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). Van Praag writes that this conquest ""marked the end of independent China,"" which was then incorporated into the Yuan dynasty that ruled China, Tibet, Mongolia, Korea, parts of Siberia and Upper Burma. Morris Rossabi, a professor of Asian history at Queens College, City University of New York, writes that ""Khubilai wished to be perceived both as the legitimate Khan of Khans of the Mongols and as the Emperor of China. Though he had, by the early 1260s, become closely identified with China, he still, for a time, claimed universal rule"", and yet ""despite his successes in China and Korea, Khubilai was unable to have himself accepted as the Great Khan"". Thus, with such limited acceptance of his position as Great Khan, Kublai Khan increasingly became identified with China and sought support as Emperor of China.",Where did Khubilai seek support as Emperor?,China,0,LOC,"Where did Khubilai seek support as Emperor?

Relevant context: Khubilai Khan, who reigned as the fifth emperor of the Mongol Empire and the founder of the Yuan Dynasty in China, sought support from a variety of sources to consolidate his power and establish a stable rule. These sources of support were both traditional and strategic, reflecting his efforts to maintain a firm grip on the diverse regions under his control.

Firstly, Khubilai capitalized on his Mongol heritage to gather support from the traditional Mongol nobility and military elite. By maintaining the fundamental aspects of Mongol governance, such as the use of the kurultai (a council of Mongol chieftains), Khubilai ensured that he did not alienate the powerful Mongol clans. This was crucial for retaining the loyalty of the Mongol warriors, who formed the backbone of his military strength.

Additionally, Khubilai sought to broaden his support by incorporating Chinese administrative practices and Confucian principles. He employed educated Chinese scholars and bureaucrats in key government positions, recognizing the importance of their expertise in managing the vast and culturally rich Chinese territories. By employing the civil service examination system, he also endeared himself to the Chinese gentry, who saw this as a return to the more merit-based governance of previous Chinese dynasties.

Khubilai also reached out to various religious groups to strengthen his legitimacy. He actively supported Buddhism and forged close ties with prominent Buddhist leaders, which helped him appeal to the sizable Buddhist population within his empire. He was also known for his religious tolerance, offering patronage to Daoism, Islam, and Christianity, which helped pacify the diverse religious communities within his realm.

Moreover, Khubilai sought economic support by fostering trade and infrastructure development. He enhanced the security and management of the Silk Road and invested in constructing roads, bridges, and the Grand Canal, promoting economic integration and prosperity throughout his empire. These initiatives not only allowed him to generate wealth but also secured the allegiance of powerful merchants and local officials who benefitted from this increased commerce.

Finally, Khubilai looked for international recognition and alliances, which he deemed essential for his legitimacy as a world ruler.

"After the 1948 election, the state turned firmly Republican. Although registered Republicans were a minority in the state until 2015, starting in 1952, Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates in all but one election (1964). This is not to say that every election has been a landslide for Republicans: Jimmy Carter lost the state by less than 1.5% in 1976, while Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton both won 40% or more of the state's popular vote in 1988 and 1996 respectively. Al Gore in 2000, though, was the last Democrat to even win any counties in the state. Oklahoma was the only state where Barack Obama failed to carry any of its counties in both 2008 and 2012.",What is the one election since 1952 where a Republican presidential candidate didn't win in Oklahoma?,1964,0,LOC,"What is the one election since 1952 where a Republican presidential candidate didn't win in Oklahoma?

Relevant context: Since 1952, Oklahoma has been an unwavering Republican stronghold in presidential elections, with one notable exception being the election of 1964. During this election, the Democratic candidate, President Lyndon B. Johnson, faced off against the Republican candidate, Senator Barry Goldwater. In a remarkable departure from the state’s typical voting pattern, Oklahoma cast its electoral votes for Johnson, favoring him over Goldwater’s more conservative platform.

The 1964 election was held in a unique political context. Following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, Lyndon B. Johnson, who was Kennedy’s vice president at the time, took office and was seeking election in his own right. The nation was experiencing a wave of sympathy for Johnson, coupled with a desire for continuity. Additionally, Johnson's campaign was highly effective in portraying Goldwater’s policies as extreme, particularly his positions on nuclear weapons and civil rights issues.

Johnson's sweeping victory was not just limited to Oklahoma; he won 44 states in total and secured a significant percentage of the popular vote nationwide. In Oklahoma, Johnson received approximately 55.75% of the vote compared to Goldwater’s 44.25%, making it the only time since 1952 that a Democratic presidential candidate has won the state.

This unique electoral outcome in Oklahoma can be partially attributed to Johnson's support for civil rights legislation, which had significant bipartisan support at the time. Moreover, the political climate of the 1960s, characterized by significant social change and the aftermath of Kennedy's assassination, contributed to the temporary shift in Oklahoma's voting behavior.

Since 1964, Oklahoma has consistently supported Republican candidates in presidential elections, reaffirming its status as a reliably conservative state. The 1964 election remains a fascinating anomaly in the state’s electoral history, often studied by political analysts and historians as an example of how national sentiment and specific candidate dynamics can influence even the most predictable electoral outcomes.",413.0,1632.0,2109,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.1310200691223145,3.9977729320526123,10.213357925415039,1964,1.0

Relevant context: Migration to Russia has a complex and multifaceted history, affecting numerous countries across different regions. Historically, Russia has been both a destination and a source of migration, with political, economic, and social factors driving its migration patterns. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Russia experienced significant inbound migration primarily from former Soviet states. This period saw an influx of people from countries such as Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, and Tajikistan. Many individuals migrated in search of better economic opportunities, given Russia's relatively strong economy compared to its neighbors.

Russia's employment opportunities in construction, industry, and service sectors attracted workers from Central Asia, particularly from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. These workers often filled labor shortages and contributed significantly to the Russian economy.

Additionally, there were notable instances of migration from countries experiencing political instability or conflict. For example, ethnic Russians and Russian speakers from the Baltic states, such as Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, relocated to Russia during and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, often due to perceived discrimination or difficulties assimilating into new national identities.

In the latter part of the 20th century and early 21st century, migration patterns also included movements from parts of the Caucasus region, including Azerbaijan and Georgia, due to economic reasons or conflicts such as those in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

This migration has contributed to Russia's demographic composition, influencing cultural dynamics and resulting in a diverse multinational environment within Russian cities. The patterns exemplify the pull factors of economic opportunity alongside push factors such as political unrest and economic hardship in neighboring regions.

In summary, migration to Russia has involved a broad array of countries primarily from Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, with migrants motivated by a combination of economic prospects and socio-political circumstances in their home countries.",386.0,1515.0,1955,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.82168173789978,0.9225790500640869,6.703328847885132,Western Europe,0.0

This alliance served both nations' interests throughout history and is regarded by many as the predecessor to NATO. Over time this went way beyond geo-political and military cooperation (protecting both nations' interests in Africa, the Americas and Asia against French, Spanish and Dutch rivals) and maintained strong trade and cultural ties between the two old European allies.

As a result, Ottoman holdings in Europe declined sharply; Bulgaria was established as an independent principality inside the Ottoman Empire, Romania achieved full independence.

In 1878, Austria-Hungary unilaterally occupied the Ottoman provinces of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Novi Pazar.",What nation attained full independence as a result of the Russo-Turkish war?,Romania,0,LOC,"What nation attained full independence as a result of the Russo-Turkish war?

Relevant context: The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 was a significant conflict between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire that played a crucial role in reshaping the national borders and political landscapes of the Balkans. A pivotal outcome of this war was the full independence of the Principality of Romania. Before the war, Romania was an autonomous principality under nominal Ottoman suzerainty, having already secured a degree of self-governance following the Treaty of Paris in 1856.

The spark for Romania's move towards independence was the broader conflict between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, driven largely by Russia's aim to gain influence over the Slavic peoples of the Balkans and reduce Ottoman control in the region. Romania, strategically positioned between these warring empires, initially declared neutrality. However, as the war unfolded, Romania allied with Russia in exchange for assurances of its full sovereignty.

The decisive turning point came with the signing of the Treaty of San Stefano in March 1878, following Russia's significant military victories. Although the treaty initially acknowledged Romania as an independent state, international pressures led to the Congress of Berlin in June 1878, where the major European powers redrew some terms of the agreement. Despite these changes, the Congress of Berlin formally recognized Romania’s independence, while requiring Romania to cede Southern Bessarabia back to Russia. In return, Romania gained Northern Dobruja, a strategic region that expanded its access to the Black Sea.

Thus, as a result of the Russo-Turkish War, Romania emerged as a fully independent nation, free from Ottoman control, marking a major milestone in the Balkan struggle for national autonomy and altering the region's geopolitical dynamics.",358.0,1658.0,2077,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.807865619659424,0.9686989784240723,5.720597267150879,Romania,1.0
"The state of Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association, a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachians.

Relevant context: In the turbulent period leading up to the American Civil War, several Southern states seceded from the Union to form the Confederate States of America. The final state to join this secessionist entity before the outbreak of hostilities was Tennessee. Tennessee's secession followed a tumultuous series of events in early 1861, marked by intense debates and internal divisions.

Initially, Tennessee was hesitant to leave the Union. In early February 1861, a referendum was held where the state's voters rejected holding a convention to consider secession. However, the situation changed dramatically following the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April and President Abraham Lincoln's subsequent call for troops to suppress the rebellion. These events galvanized pro-secessionist sentiments throughout the South.

On June 8, 1861, Tennessee conducted a second popular vote, in which the decision to secede was overwhelmingly endorsed. Governor Isham G. Harris, a staunch advocate for joining the Confederacy, played a pivotal role in rallying support for the vote. The results unambiguously favored secession, and on June 24, 1861, the state was officially admitted to the Confederate States of America.

By joining the Confederacy, Tennessee became the last state to secede prior to the commencement of widespread combat operations in what would become the Civil War. Its strategic location and resources made it a critical member of the Confederacy as battles soon erupted throughout the Southern and border states.

"The Quran consists of 114 chapters of varying lengths, each known as a sura. Suras are classified as Meccan or Medinan, depending on whether the verses were revealed before or after the migration of Muhammad to the city of Medina. However, a sura classified as Medinan may contain Meccan verses in it and vice versa. Sura titles are derived from a name or quality discussed in the text, or from the first letters or words of the sura. Suras are arranged roughly in order of decreasing size.

Relevant context: The Quran, the holy book of Islam, is composed of 114 chapters known as suras. These suras are traditionally divided into two main categories based on the cities in which they were revealed: Meccan and Medinan.

1. **Meccan Suras**: These suras were revealed in Mecca during the early period of Muhammad's prophethood, before the migration (Hijra) to Medina in 622 CE. The Meccan suras are generally characterized by their poetic style and vivid imagery. They often focus on fundamental aspects of faith such as the oneness of God (Tawhid), the Day of Judgment, and the moral and ethical guidelines for believers. The themes are largely universal and spiritual, addressing the challenges faced by early Muslims in Mecca, who were a minority facing considerable opposition. Some of the most famous Meccan suras include Surah Al-Fatiha, Surah Al-Ikhlas, and Surah Al-Qamar.

2. **Medinan Suras**: These suras were revealed after the Prophet Muhammad's migration to Medina. The socio-political context of Medina was different from that of Mecca. In Medina, the Muslim community was establishing itself as a social and political entity. Therefore, the Medinan suras often address community laws, social ordinances, and directives for establishing justice and governance. They also cover issues like warfare, charity, and interactions with other religious communities. Surah Al-Baqarah, Surah An-Nisa, and Surah Al-Ma'idah are well-known examples of Medinan suras.

The distinction between Meccan and Medinan suras not only helps in understanding the chronological order of revelation but also provides insights into the evolving context of the early Muslim community. Each sura's classification often influences the interpretation and application of its verses, reflecting the transition from persecution in Mecca to community building in Medina.",400.0,1435.0,1895,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.520741701126099,0.9799630641937256,7.489233732223511,"Meccan, Medinan",0.5

About this time the Persians made a semi-secret agreement to remain neutral in exchange for the cancellation of the indemnity from the previous war.",Where did the main forces stand?,Kars and Gyumri,0,LOC,"Where did the main forces stand?

Relevant context: In the context of the Battle of Gettysburg, which took place from July 1 to July 3, 1863, during the American Civil War, the main forces stood positioned across a series of strategic locations around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Union Army, commanded by Major General George G. Meade, occupied a formidable defensive position along a series of hills and ridges south of the town. This included Cemetery Hill, Culp’s Hill, and extended down Cemetery Ridge to Little Round Top. These positions were anchored with artillery that provided a strong defensive advantage.

The Confederate Army, under the command of General Robert E. Lee, deployed its forces to the north and west of the Union line. The Confederate troops occupied Seminary Ridge directly opposite the Union position and extended their line from Oak Hill to the west, around McPherson Ridge, and into the town itself. On the second day of battle, Lee's forces stretched to the east against the Union left flank, trying to outmaneuver and attack the Union Army's positions.

One of the pivotal moments occurred on July 3, when the Confederate forces launched what would become known as Pickett’s Charge. This involved a direct assault on the center of the Union line located along Cemetery Ridge, a gambit that led to severe Confederate casualties and ultimately failed, marking a turning point in the battle.

These positions—anchored by natural defensive terrain and buttressed by improvised fortifications and artillery placements —were central to the strategies employed by both armies and played a critical role in the outcome of the battle.

Relevant context: In many mythological traditions, the concept of a divine figure undergoing purification is often symbolic. However, in ancient Greek mythology, this idea is particularly personified in the legend of the goddess Artemis. According to myth, Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, wild animals, and childbirth, was believed to purify herself at the sacred lake within the sanctuary of Delos after a significant event. Delos, a small island in the Aegean Sea, held immense importance in Greek mythology as the birthplace of Artemis and her twin brother, Apollo. 

Purification rituals in Greek tradition often involved water or other symbolic acts to cleanse and renew the individual, reflecting a rebirth or a reaffirmation of purity and divinity. For Artemis, this purification served not only as a literal cleansing but also as a deeper spiritual renewal. The sanctuary at Delos was regarded as a potent sacred space where the divine could rejuvenate, underscoring Artemis's connection to nature and the cyclical renewal of life.

Another notable instance of divine purification can be found in the mythology surrounding the Roman goddess Vesta. The Vestals, priestesses dedicated to serving Vesta, goddess of the hearth and home, maintained the sacred fire and conducted purification rites in the temple of Vesta located in Rome. Although Vesta herself, as an embodiment of the eternal flame, did not undergo purification, the rituals conducted in her name emphasized purity and continuous spiritual hygiene as central themes.

While the question of where 'the divinity herself' is purified can vary across different mythologies and interpretations, these examples showcase the symbolic spaces that ancient cultures dedicated to such transformative acts. Whether through the waters of Delos or the eternal flame of Vesta's temple, these purification sites functioned as conduits for the renewal and sanctification of divine figures, underscoring the intricate relationship between physical space and spiritual mythology.",386.0,1517.0,1956,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.295311689376831,1.099611759185791,6.505920171737671,Athens,0.0
"Armenian literature dates back to 400 AD, when Mesrop Mashtots first invented the Armenian alphabet. This period of time is often viewed as the Golden Age of Armenian literature. Early Armenian literature was written by the ""father of Armenian history"", Moses of Chorene, who authored The History of Armenia. The book covers the time-frame from the formation of the Armenian people to the fifth century AD. The nineteenth century beheld a great literary movement that was to give rise to modern Armenian literature. This period of time, during which Armenian culture flourished, is known as the Revival period (Zartonki sherchan). The Revivalist authors of Constantinople and Tiflis, almost identical to the Romanticists of Europe, were interested in encouraging Armenian nationalism. Most of them adopted the newly created Eastern or Western variants of the Armenian language depending on the targeted audience, and preferred them over classical Armenian (grabar). This period ended after the Hamidian massacres, when Armenians experienced turbulent times. As Armenian history of the 1920s and of the Genocide came to be more openly discussed, writers like Paruyr Sevak, Gevork Emin, Silva Kaputikyan and Hovhannes Shiraz began a new era of literature.",Which European movement were the Revivalist authors similar to?,Romanticists,0,LOC,"Which European movement were the Revivalist authors similar to?

Relevant context: The Revivalist authors share many similarities with the Romantic movement that swept through Europe during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Like the Romantics, Revivalist authors sought to evoke an emotional response through their work and often focused on themes of nature, individualism, and the sublime.

Romanticism emerged as a reaction against the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and order, instead highlighting the importance of emotion, imagination, and the beauty of the natural world. Similarly, Revivalist authors often rejected the rationalism and industrialization of their own time, favoring instead a return to traditional values, spirituality, and a deep introspection of the human condition.

Both movements shared a fascination with the past and the mysterious. While the Romantics frequently drew inspiration from medieval themes and legends, Revivalist authors often looked back to the cultural and religious traditions of their regions. This was a way to reclaim and celebrate cultural heritage at a time when it seemed to be threatened by modern influences.

Furthermore, just as Romantic poets like Wordsworth and Coleridge emphasized the power of personal experience and emotion, Revivalist authors explored the subjective and spiritual dimensions of life, often expressing a longing for meaning in a rapidly changing world. This exploration was mirrored in the Romantic tendency to prioritize personal sentiment and the exploration of one's inner world.

In summary, the Revivalist movement shared with Romanticism a deep skepticism of modernity and industrialization, a focus on emotional depth and individual experience, and a reverence for the past and the natural world. These shared characteristics position Revivalist authors within a broader tradition of European Romantic thought, making them analogous to their Romantic counterparts in terms of themes, motivations, and artistic goals.",354.0,1568.0,1979,1.0,0.25,0.43067655807339306,3.6919424533843994,1.1490418910980225,5.971992254257202,Romanticists,1.0

The imperial clouds wavering over Somalia alarmed the Dervish leader Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, who gathered Somali soldiers from across the Horn of Africa and began one of the longest anti-colonial wars ever. The Dervish State successfully repulsed the British empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region. As a result of its successes against the British, the Dervish State received support from the Ottoman and German empires. The Turks also named Hassan Emir of the Somali nation, and the Germans promised to officially recognize any territories the Dervishes were to acquire. After a quarter of a century of holding the British at bay, the Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920, when Britain for the first time in Africa used airplanes to bomb the Dervish capital of Taleex. As a result of this bombardment, former Dervish territories were turned into a protectorate of Britain. Italy similarly faced the same opposition from Somali Sultans and armies and did not acquire full control of parts of modern Somalia until the Fascist era in late 1927. This occupation lasted till 1941 and was replaced by a British military administration.",What was the capital of the Dervish State?,Taleex,0,LOC,"What was the capital of the Dervish State?

Relevant context: The Dervish State, an Islamic state established in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the Horn of Africa, named its capital Taleh. Located in the northern part of present-day Somalia, Taleh served as the political and administrative center of this movement led by the charismatic religious and military leader, Mohammed Abdullah Hassan. The Dervish State was known for its resistance against colonial powers, including the British, Italians, and Ethiopians, and the strategic choice of Taleh as the capital reinforced its resilience against foreign advances. 

Taleh was fortified with a complex of stone castles, which were constructed with remarkable intricacy, signifying the importance of the town in both defensive and symbolic terms. These fortifications housed various governmental and military functions of the state, including barracks and warehouses. The location of Taleh was strategically chosen not only for its defensible terrain but also for its ability to serve as a base from which the Dervish forces could launch raids and military campaigns.

During its peak from approximately 1900 to 1920, the Dervish State operated as a sovereign polity with its own flag, military, and governance structures, utilizing Taleh as the epicenter of its operations. However, after persistent military campaigns and a notorious aerial bombardment by the British Royal Air Force in 1920, the influence of the Dervish State dramatically diminished, leading to the fall of Taleh.

Other notable minority languages include Armenian, Georgian, and the Greco-Turkic dialect spoken by the Urums, a community of Caucasus Greeks from the Tsalka region of central Georgia and ethnic Greeks from southeastern Ukraine who arrived in mainly Northern Greece as economic migrants in the 1990s.",Where are Slavic speaking groups generally found?,northern Greek borders,0,LOC,"Where are Slavic speaking groups generally found?

Relevant context: Slavic-speaking groups are primarily found across a broad expanse of Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and parts of the Balkans. These groups can be classified into three main subdivisions: West Slavs, East Slavs, and South Slavs, each of which occupies distinct geographical regions.

The **West Slavs** primarily inhabit central Europe and include nations such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Within these countries, the predominant languages are Polish, Czech, and Slovak, respectively. West Slavic languages also have historical ties to regions in eastern Germany, although these areas are now largely German-speaking due to historical shifts.

The **East Slavs** are predominantly located further east and are represented by the largest Slavic-speaking nations. This group includes Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians. Russia spans both Eastern Europe and northern Asia, making Russian the most widespread Slavic language. Ukraine and Belarus are also key centers for East Slavic languages, with Ukrainian and Belarusian being the primary languages spoken there.

The **South Slavs** reside mainly in the Balkan Peninsula and southeastern Europe. This group comprises countries such as Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Slovenia, and Bulgaria. Each of these nations has its own distinct language or dialect, including Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Montenegrin, Macedonian, Slovenian, and Bulgarian.

Historically, Slavic-speaking groups have been influenced by a range of cultural and political interactions with neighboring regions, which have contributed to the diversity and distribution of the Slavic languages today.

Relevant context: Certainly! To address the query ""What states did the chain extend over?"" consider a hypothetical scenario:

In its heyday, the restaurant chain ""Southern Bites"" extended its reach across a broad swath of the United States, tapping into diverse regional markets. The chain initially launched in Georgia, where its first location drew on the rich culinary traditions of the South. As the brand gained popularity, it quickly expanded into neighboring Alabama and South Carolina, capitalizing on the Southern cultural familiarity.

The strategic expansion didn't stop there. Embracing a vision of nationwide appeal, Southern Bites soon established a presence in Tennessee and Florida, both offering robust markets with a mix of local and tourist customers. These early successes set the stage for further incursions into the Midwest and West.

By the late 2000s, Southern Bites had successfully ventured beyond its Southern roots, with locations sprouting up in Texas and Louisiana, which melded with the chain's original culinary ethos. Upon entering the Midwest, the chain took on new challenges, opening outlets in Missouri and Illinois, where it endeavored to introduce Southern comfort food to new audiences.

The brand's vision of national reach took another leap as it tapped into the populous states of California and New York. Here, Southern Bites adapted its offerings to cater to city dwellers seeking an authentic taste of the South. Finally, the chain reached into more unconventional territories like Colorado and Arizona, where its unique dining experience resonated with consumers looking for diverse culinary options.

In summary, Southern Bites extended over a wide swath of the United States, including key states such as Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Missouri, Illinois, California, New York, Colorado, and Arizona.

"Matthew Arnold contrasted ""culture"" with anarchy; other Europeans, following philosophers Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, contrasted ""culture"" with ""the state of nature"". According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the Native Americans who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between ""civilized"" and ""uncivilized."" According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to Herbert Spencer's theory of Social Darwinism and Lewis Henry Morgan's theory of cultural evolution. Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is really an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, some critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is really an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial subjects.","Which two philosophers contrasted ""culture"" with the state of nature?",Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau,0,LOC,"Which two philosophers contrasted ""culture"" with the state of nature?

Relevant context: In the history of philosophical thought, the concepts of “culture” and “the state of nature” have been pivotal in understanding human society and its development. Notably, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Thomas Hobbes are two philosophers who provided contrasting views on the relationship between these concepts.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau, an 18th-century Genevan philosopher, is renowned for his perspective on the state of nature and the role of culture in shaping human behavior. In his seminal work, ""The Social Contract,"" Rousseau presents the idea that humans were once in a state of nature, characterized by freedom and equality, without the corrupting influence of societal structures. He argued that as people formed communities and developed institutions, they began to live in a civilization that imposed culture, which, paradoxically, brought about inequality and competition among individuals. For Rousseau, culture represents a deviation from the state of nature, introducing artificial inequalities and constraints on human freedom.

In contrast, Thomas Hobbes, a 17th-century English philosopher, provides a different interpretation in his work ""Leviathan."" Hobbes famously described the state of nature as a ""war of all against all,"" where life was ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."" He viewed the state of nature as chaotic and violent, necessitating the establishment of social contracts to form governments and societies, which he viewed as the foundation of culture. For Hobbes, culture involves the establishment of order and structure through the authority of a sovereign, moving humanity away from the anarchic state of nature into a more organized and stable existence.

Thus, while both Rousseau and Hobbes contrast culture with the state of nature, their interpretations reveal stark differences. Rousseau mourns the loss of the state of nature with the rise of social structures, viewing culture as a source of inequality and corruption. Meanwhile, Hobbes sees culture as a necessary evolution from the dangerous and disordered state of nature, emphasizing the protective and stabilizing role of societal constructs. These differing views influence ongoing debates in philosophy, politics, and sociology about human nature, society, and the role of culture in shaping human behavior.",450.0,2279.0,2791,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.321374177932739,1.1957721710205078,8.618378162384033,Hobbes and Rousseau,0.8
"Carthage never recovered militarily after the Second Punic War, but quickly economically and the Third Punic War that followed was in reality a simple punitive mission after the neighbouring Numidians allied to Rome robbed/attacked Carthaginian merchants. Treaties had forbidden any war with Roman allies, and defense against robbing/pirates was considered as ""war action"": Rome decided to annihilate the city of Carthage. Carthage was almost defenceless, and submitted when besieged. However, the Romans demanded complete surrender and moval of the city into the (desert) inland far off any coastal or harbour region, and the Carthaginians refused. The city was besieged, stormed, and completely destroyed. Ultimately, all of Carthage's North African and Iberian territories were acquired by Rome. Note that ""Carthage"" was not an 'empire', but a league of punic colonies (port cities in the western mediterranean) like the 1st and 2nd Athenian (""attic"") leagues, under leadership of Carthage. Punic Carthago was gone, but the other punic cities in the western mediterranean flourished under Roman rule.",What cities flourished after they were conquered by the Romans?,punic cities,0,LOC,"What cities flourished after they were conquered by the Romans?

Relevant context: Throughout the vast expanse of the Roman Empire, numerous cities flourished after falling into Roman hands, benefiting from infrastructure development, trade, and the Pax Romana. One prime example of this transformation is Londinium (modern-day London). After the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43, Londinium quickly developed into a bustling hub of commerce and trade, strategically positioned along the River Thames. The Romans implemented a systematic urban plan, erecting essential structures such as roads, a forum, public baths, and the infamous London Wall, which facilitated both protection and economic prosperity.

Another city that thrived post-conquest is Lugdunum (modern-day Lyon). Following its establishment in 43 BC after the conquest of the Gallic tribes, Lugdunum became the administrative capital of Roman Gaul, leveraging its favorable location at the confluence of the Rhône and Saône rivers to become a key trading center. The Romans invested heavily in the city’s infrastructure, building theaters, aqueducts, and a sophisticated road network, which integrated Lugdunum into the broader Roman world, enhancing its economic and cultural stature.

In the eastern Mediterranean, Ephesus became one of the most important cities in the Roman Empire after its subjugation. Located in what is now Turkey, Ephesus was incorporated into Roman Asia in 129 BC. Under Roman rule, the city flourished, bolstered by the construction of grandiose structures such as the Library of Celsus and a large amphitheater. Ephesus was an important port city, facilitating robust trade and cultural exchanges between East and West, and benefiting from the security and stability of Roman governance.

Jerash (known as Gerasa in antiquity), located in present-day Jordan, saw significant development under Roman rule after its conquest in the first century AD. As part of the Decapolis league, Jerash became a thriving center of commerce and culture, with its streets adorned with colonnades, temples, and spacious baths. Its prosperity was fueled by its strategic location along several trade routes and its integration into the Roman economy.

These examples illuminate how the Roman Empire’s conquests often led to significant urban development, fostering economic growth and cultural exchanges that allowed these cities to prosper. These centers became vital components of the Roman imperial network, characterized by enhanced connectivity, architectural sophistication, and cross-cultural interactions under the unifying influence of Roman law and governance.",496.0,2041.0,2596,1.0,0.14285714285714285,0.3333333333333333,5.135607004165649,1.1458332538604736,7.41152548789978,Greek cities in Sicily,0.0

Relevant context: Certainly! Christianity, while historically significant in many cities around the world, often finds its communities thriving in specific neighborhoods where churches and Christian cultural institutions are more prevalent. For instance, in the city of New York, Christianity and its vibrant communities can be particularly found in neighborhoods such as Harlem and Brooklyn Heights.

In Harlem, the gospel tradition is a vital part of the neighborhood's cultural tapestry, with historic churches like the Abyssinian Baptist Church playing a central role in the community. These churches not only serve as places of worship but also as community centers, offering social services, cultural events, and educational programs that reinforce the Christian faith and its values within the community.

Brooklyn Heights, known for its stunning architecture and serene environment, is home to several historic churches such as the Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims, which has a storied history in the abolitionist movement. This neighborhood has maintained a rich tradition of progressive Christian thought and practice, drawing a diverse congregation appreciative of its historical and cultural context.

Similarly, in Los Angeles, neighborhoods like Koreatown and parts of the San Fernando Valley have a noticeable Christian presence. Koreatown, while known for its vibrant Korean population, hosts numerous Korean Methodist and Presbyterian churches, reflective of the strong Christian heritage in South Korea that has been brought over by immigrants and maintained for generations. These churches often serve as cultural hubs, providing services in both Korean and English and organizing community events that cater to both traditional and contemporary Christian practices.

Relevant context: Muammar Gaddafi, the former Libyan leader, envisioned a unique socio-political system that he documented in his ideological manifesto known as ""The Green Book."" Gaddafi's vision for the state centered around a form of direct democracy known as ""Jamahiriya,"" which he described as a ""state of the masses.""

"Napoleon established a political system that historian Martyn Lyons called ""dictatorship by plebiscite."" Worried by the democratic forces unleashed by the Revolution, but unwilling to ignore them entirely, Napoleon resorted to regular electoral consultations with the French people on his road to imperial power. He drafted the Constitution of the Year VIII and secured his own election as First Consul, taking up residence at the Tuileries. The constitution was approved in a rigged plebiscite held the following January, with 99.94 percent officially listed as voting ""yes."" Napoleon's brother, Lucien, had falsified the returns to show that 3 million people had participated in the plebiscite; the real number was 1.5 million. Political observers at the time assumed the eligible French voting public numbered about 5 million people, so the regime artificially doubled the participation rate to indicate popular enthusiasm for the Consulate. In the first few months of the Consulate, with war in Europe still raging and internal instability still plaguing the country, Napoleon's grip on power remained very tenuous.","  After his election to First Consul, where did Napoleon take up residence?",the Tuileries.,0,LOC,"  After his election to First Consul, where did Napoleon take up residence?

Relevant context: Following his election as the First Consul of France in November 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte took up residence at the Tuileries Palace in Paris. This move marked a significant shift in the center of power, as the palace symbolized authority and governance. The Tuileries, located near the Louvre, had long been associated with French royalty and state affairs, reinforcing Napoleon’s intent to consolidate control and stabilize the nation after the tumultuous years of the Revolution. Upon his arrival, Napoleon focused on renovating and reorganizing the palace to suit his administration's needs, turning it into the nerve center of his burgeoning government.

"Federal law originates with the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to enact statutes for certain limited purposes like regulating interstate commerce. The United States Code is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes. Many statutes give executive branch agencies the power to create regulations, which are published in the Federal Register and codified into the Code of Federal Regulations. Regulations generally also carry the force of law under the Chevron doctrine. Many lawsuits turn on the meaning of a federal statute or regulation, and judicial interpretations of such meaning carry legal force under the principle of stare decisis.",Where does federal law begin?,the Constitution,0,LOC,"Where does federal law begin?

Relevant context: Federal law in the United States begins with the U.S. Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land. It was ratified in 1788 and establishes the framework for the federal government, delineates the powers of the three branches of government - the legislative, executive, and judicial - and outlines the rights and freedoms of individuals. The Constitution is crucial because it sets forth not only what the government can do but also what it cannot do, primarily through the Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments.

From the Constitution, federal law flows through the enactment of statutes by Congress, which is the legislative branch of the federal government. Congress enacts laws under the powers granted to it by the Constitution, such as regulating interstate commerce, taxing, and spending for the general welfare. These statutes are compiled in the United States Code, which organizes and codifies the various laws for easier access and understanding.

Federal law is further shaped by regulations created by federal agencies. These agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency or the Securities and Exchange Commission, are granted authority by Congress to create detailed rules and regulations within the framework of the enabling legislation. These regulations have the force of law and are published in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Judicial decisions also play a significant role in the interpretation and application of federal law. The federal judiciary, through its power of judicial review, interprets the Constitution and federal statutes, resolving disputes that arise under them. Decisions by the United States Supreme Court, the highest court in the country, have a significant and binding effect on the interpretation of federal law.

In summary, federal law begins with the U.S. Constitution, is enacted through statutes by Congress, supplemented by regulations from federal agencies, and interpreted by the judiciary.

Relevant context: In the context of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) shared its extensive southern border with several other Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs), including the Kazakh SSR. The RSFSR bordered the Kazakh SSR to its southeast. In addition to the Kazakh SSR, the RSFSR also bordered other SSRs, notably the Ukrainian SSR to the southwest.

The RSFSR and the Kazakh SSR were two of the largest republics in the Soviet Union, both in terms of land area and ethnically diverse populations. The RSFSR was the largest, comprising a significant portion of the Soviet territory, extending from Eastern Europe across Asia to the North Pacific Ocean. This vast area meant that the RSFSR shared borders with several other Soviet republics in addition to the Kazakh SSR, including the Baltic republics (e.g., the Lithuanian SSR and Latvian SSR) to the west, the Belorussian SSR to the southwest, and others.

To the east of the Kazakh SSR, the RSFSR had regions such as the Altai and Novosibirsk. The geographic and political alignments within these borders allowed for various cultural, economic, and administrative exchanges between the RSFSR and the Kazakh SSR, influenced by prominent cities like Omsk and Novosibirsk in the RSFSR and cities like Pavlodar and Petropavl in Kazakhstan.

"The meaning of federalism, as a political movement, and of what constitutes a 'federalist', varies with country and historical context.[citation needed] Movements associated with the establishment or development of federations can exhibit either centralising or decentralising trends.[citation needed] For example, at the time those nations were being established, factions known as ""federalists"" in the United States and Australia advocated the formation of strong central government. Similarly, in European Union politics, federalists mostly seek greater EU integration. In contrast, in Spain and in post-war Germany, federal movements have sought decentralisation: the transfer of power from central authorities to local units. In Canada, where Quebec separatism has been a political force for several decades, the ""federalist"" impulse aims to keep Quebec inside Canada.",What countries advocate for a strong central government?,United States and Australia,0,LOC,"What countries advocate for a strong central government?

Relevant context: Several countries around the world advocate for a strong central government as part of their political philosophy or historical development. In these nations, the central government holds significant power over regional or local authorities, often to maintain unity, enforce policies evenly, or foster national development.

**China** is a prominent example where a strong central government is maintained through the leadership of the Communist Party. The Chinese government emphasizes a centralized political structure to ensure political stability, economic growth, and social harmony. The central government in Beijing exerts control over provincial authorities, implementing nationwide policies relating to economic planning, public health, and education. Regional leaders are appointed by the central government and are expected to align with national strategies and Communist Party directives.

Another example is **France**, where the concept of a central government is deeply rooted in its administrative framework. Historically, the French Revolutionary government centralized power to create a unified nation from various regional identities. Today, France remains a unitary state, with the central government controlling key policy areas such as national defense, education, and public transportation. Although there has been some devolution of powers to regional councils, the central government in Paris retains significant authority to ensure uniformity in law and policy application across the country.

**Russia** also advocates for a strong central government under the leadership of its president. The Russian Federation, while nominally a federation, maintains a centralized power structure where the central government in Moscow holds substantial sway over its constituent republics and regions. This centralization is justified as necessary for maintaining national security, managing vast natural resources, and preserving the country's territorial integrity.

In contrast, countries like **Singapore** reflect a different reason for supporting a strong central government — facilitating swift decision-making and economic planning in a small city-state context. The Singaporean government exercises tight control over its policies, with a focus on efficiency and effectiveness in managing resources and navigating global economic challenges.

Historically, **Turkey** has also embraced strong central government principles, particularly under Atatürk’s leadership in the early 20th century, with the aim of modernizing and unifying the nation-state. This centrist approach has persisted through various regimes, focusing on national cohesion and economic development.

Each of these countries leverages their strong central governments to pursue economic stability, social cohesion, political unity, and the ability to implement comprehensive national policies effectively.

Relevant context: The teachings of the samurai, Japan's historical warrior class, live on in various forms of modern Japanese culture and society. One of the most significant ways is through martial arts, such as Kendo, Iaido, and Judo. These disciplines emphasize not only physical skills but also the mental and spiritual growth that were central to the Bushido code—the ethical framework followed by the samurai. Bushido, which translates as ""the way of the warrior,"" encompasses principles such as loyalty, honor, discipline, and self-sacrifice.

Moreover, the influence of samurai can be seen in modern business practices in Japan. Many companies incorporate the ethical tenets of Bushido, emphasizing respect, perseverance, and a sense of duty. This philosophical foundation encourages dedication to one's work, akin to the samurai's devotion to their lord.

The samurai legacy is also preserved in literature and popular culture. The stories of samurai are conveyed through classic Japanese literature, including historical tales such as ""The Tale of the Heike"" and ""Hagakure."" In more contemporary settings, samurai narratives are adapted into films, anime, and manga, ensuring that the values and stories remain alive and resonate with new generations. Directors like Akira Kurosawa have immortalized samurai values through movies like ""Seven Samurai,"" which not only entertain but also offer insights into the mindset of these warriors.

Additionally, samurai teachings influence educational philosophies. The emphasis on character building and integrity in Japanese schools can often trace its roots back to the principles taught by the samurai. Schools often incorporate lessons on virtue and ethics alongside academic education, reflecting the samurai's holistic approach to personal development.

The core of the Spanish East Indies was what is now the country of the Philippines. This archipelago, comprising more than 7,000 islands, was the principal colony and administrative center of Spanish influence in the region. The name ""Philippines"" itself derives from King Philip II of Spain during whose reign the islands were colonized in the 1560s.

Besides the Philippines, the Spanish East Indies also extended to other regions. Notably, it included the Mariana Islands, which are located in the western Pacific Ocean. Among the Mariana Islands, Guam remained a significant strategic and economic hub for the Spanish Empire, particularly as a refueling port for the Manila Galleons that sailed between Acapulco, Mexico, and Manila.

The Caroline Islands, also in the western Pacific, were part of the Spanish East Indies as well. These islands are now split between two nations: the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau. Another group of islands that were part of the Spanish East Indies were the Palau Islands themselves, though they were not as heavily colonized compared to others.

Additionally, the Spanish influence extended to some areas of the Moluccas, also historically known as the Spice Islands, particularly in the earlier phases of Spanish presence in Asia, although full control there was not sustained.

It's important to note that while the Spanish East Indies was a diverse collection of island territories, each with its own local customs and cultures, Spanish colonial rule sought to centralize administration and spread Christianity, which has left a lasting cultural impact, especially in the Philippines where Spanish influence is still evident in the country's major religion, language, architecture, and many aspects of daily life.

Overall, these islands featured a wide variety of cultural and linguistic diversity, harboring complex societies that existed long before European colonization. However, through their integration into the Spanish East Indies, they became interconnected parts of the global Spanish colonial network, influencing trade, culture, and politics in profound ways across the Pacific Ocean.",476.0,1568.0,2104,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,7.016564846038818,1.0669434070587158,12.055849552154541,"Guam, Northern Mariana Islands",0.5
"The Battle for Mexico City was the series of engagements from September 8 to September 15, 1847, in the general vicinity of Mexico City during the Mexican–American War. Included are major actions at the battles of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec, culminating with the fall of Mexico City. The U.S. Army under Winfield Scott scored a major success that ended the war. The American invasion into the Federal District was first resisted during the Battle of Churubusco on August 8 where the Saint Patrick's Battalion, which was composed primarily of Catholic Irish and German immigrants, but also Canadians, English, French, Italians, Poles, Scots, Spaniards, Swiss, and Mexican people, fought for the Mexican cause repelling the American attacks. After defeating the Saint Patrick's Battalion, the Mexican–American War came to a close after the United States deployed combat units deep into Mexico resulting in the capture of Mexico City and Veracruz by the U.S. Army's 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Divisions. The invasion culminated with the storming of Chapultepec Castle in the city itself.",What American divisions got into Mexico City?,"U.S. Army's 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th",0,LOC,"What American divisions got into Mexico City?

Relevant context: During the Mexican-American War, which lasted from 1846 to 1848, the Battle for Mexico City was a pivotal campaign that led to the capture of the Mexican capital by American forces. The advance into Mexico City was spearheaded by Major General Winfield Scott, who orchestrated a series of strategic maneuvers that culminated in the city's capture in September 1847.

Several elite American divisions played crucial roles in this critical phase of the war. Notably, the regular army divisions under Scott's command, including the 1st and 3rd Divisions, were instrumental in the campaign's success. The 1st Division, led by General William J. Worth, was key in the assault on the castle of Chapultepec, an essential victory that paved the way for entering the city. Worth's division, along with the 2nd Division led by General David E. Twiggs, had previously secured victories at battles such as Molino del Rey, further weakening Mexico City's defenses.

The attack on the capital also saw the contribution of volunteer regiments and engineering battalions, who undertook essential operations like breaching defensive positions and constructing makeshift bridges for advancing troops. After breaching the San Cosme and Belén gates, which were pivotal entry points into the city, American forces were successful in forcing the Mexican army to retreat, leading to the occupation of Mexico City on September 14, 1847.

The capture of Mexico City marked a decisive moment in the Mexican-American War, with General Scott's forces participating in the city's occupation until the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, which officially ended the conflict. This campaign demonstrated the effectiveness of combined arms operations and strategic leadership, showcasing how these American divisions were able to overcome formidable defenses and secure victory.",372.0,2018.0,2458,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.543730735778809,1.1340878009796143,6.756134033203125,"1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Divisions",0.8

Similarly, in 1845 the schooner Naiad punished a native for stealing with such violence that the natives attacked the ship. Later that year a whaler's boat crew were killed. In 1852 the San Francisco-based ships Glencoe and Sea Nymph were attacked and everyone aboard except for one crew member were killed. The violence was usually attributed as a response to the ill treatment of the natives in response to petty theft, which was a common practice. In 1857, two missionaries successfully settled on Ebon, living among the natives through at least 1870.:3",Where did missionaries live as of 1857?,Ebon,0,LOC,"Where did missionaries live as of 1857?

Relevant context: In 1857, missionaries lived in a variety of locations around the world, often situated in regions where they aimed to spread their religious beliefs and provide education, healthcare, and other services. Their residences were typically established in areas that were either under colonial influence or where local authorities permitted foreign presence. Here are some key locations and details regarding where missionaries lived during this period:

1. **Africa**: Missionaries were stationed in several parts of Africa, particularly in regions controlled by European powers. For example, British missionaries from the London Missionary Society operated in South Africa, where they established mission stations and schools. They often lived in mission houses constructed in rural or semi-urban areas. In West Africa, the Church Missionary Society had a significant presence in Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

2. **Asia**: In India, British and American missionaries were active, residing in cities and rural areas where they established schools and churches. Missionaries from various Christian denominations lived in enclaves within India under the broader protection of the British East India Company, which facilitated their entry into the country. In China, missionaries lived in treaty ports like Shanghai, which were established following the Opium Wars and allowed foreign nationals to reside and work due to treaties like the Treaty of Nanking.

3. **Pacific Islands**: The Pacific islands, including Hawaii and Tahiti, saw significant missionary activity. The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions had missionaries living throughout the Hawaiian Islands, where they played a crucial role in education and societal changes. The London Missionary Society also had a strong presence in Tahiti, where missionaries often lived in simple homes alongside converted local leaders.

4. **North and South America**: While missionaries had a long-established presence in the Americas, by 1857, their focus was more on outreach to indigenous populations and newly arrived immigrant communities. They lived in mission settlements and engaged with Native American tribes in the United States, and in South America, they often settled in areas where they could reach remote indigenous populations.

5. **Europe**: While Europe was predominantly Christian, missionaries from various denominations often lived in training centers or mission headquarters, such as those in London or Basel, Switzerland. These were jumping-off points for training and dispatching missionaries to other parts of the world.

Missionaries lived in residences that varied from modest homes to larger mission complexes, depending on the location and resources available. Their living conditions were influenced by the local environment, the level of support from their home countries, and the relationships they forged with local communities.

"The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese.",Where did the Ottoman and Portuguese have Naval wars in the 16th century?,the Indian Ocean,0,LOC,"Where did the Ottoman and Portuguese have Naval wars in the 16th century?

Relevant context: In the 16th century, the Ottoman and Portuguese empires were two dominant maritime powers who clashed in a series of naval engagements primarily focused on gaining control of lucrative trading routes and strategic locations in the Indian Ocean and surrounding regions. These naval conflicts occurred as both empires sought to expand their influence over the spice trade and establish dominance in South and Southeast Asia.

One of the earliest and most notable theaters of conflict was the Arabian Sea, particularly around the strategic port cities of the Arabian Peninsula and the western coasts of India. In 1509, one of the first significant confrontations occurred at the Battle of Diu. The battle took place near the port city of Diu, located on the southern tip of the Kathiawar Peninsula in India. Here, a Portuguese fleet decisively defeated an allied fleet composed of ships from the Ottoman Empire, the Sultanate of Gujarat, the Mamluk Sultanate, and other regional powers.

The Ottoman Empire, under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, later sought to counter Portuguese influence in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. This led to further conflicts, one of the most notable being the Siege of Diu in 1538. The Ottomans, under the command of Admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa and later Suleiman himself, attempted to capture the Portuguese stronghold at Diu but were ultimately unsuccessful.

Throughout the mid-16th century, the Ottomans continued their efforts to challenge Portuguese control over the Indian Ocean by expanding their naval presence and establishing bases at key locations such as Aden, Mocha, and the island of Socotra, aiming to disrupt Portuguese shipping lanes. Additionally, naval skirmishes took place in the Persian Gulf, with the Ottomans leveraging their control of Basra to exert pressure on Portuguese-held Bahrain and Hormuz.

In Southeast Asia, the strategic Strait of Malacca saw competition between the Portuguese-controlled Malacca and Ottoman-aligned regional powers like the Sultanate of Aceh. While direct large-scale naval warfare between the Ottoman and Portuguese fleets in this region was limited, the Ottoman influence supported local resistance against Portuguese colonization efforts.

Lastly, during the latter part of the century, the Ottomans made a significant push to establish themselves in the Indian Ocean by strengthening their alliances with local sultanates on the Swahili Coast of East Africa such as Mombasa and Kilwa. Although no major naval battles ensued in this region, the Ottoman presence there was part of their broader strategy to weaken Portuguese influence in Indian Ocean maritime trade.

Overall, the Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars of the 16th century were characterized by a series of engagements across a vast maritime theater, from the Arabian Sea to the Persian Gulf and beyond, dictated by the geopolitics of the time and the strategic significance of the region's trade routes.",589.0,1944.0,2594,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.853139638900757,1.0491268634796143,10.815621614456177,Indian Ocean,0.9
"Elizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their governess, Marion Crawford, who was casually known as ""Crawfie"". Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature and music. Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled The Little Princesses in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family. The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of responsibility. Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill described Elizabeth when she was two as ""a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant."" Her cousin Margaret Rhodes described her as ""a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved"".",Where were the royal princesses educated?,at home,0,LOC,"Where were the royal princesses educated?

Relevant context: The education of royal princesses has varied greatly throughout history, depending on the era and the specific royal family to which they belonged. In contemporary times, many royal families prioritize a well-rounded and international education for their princesses, often beginning with exclusive private schools and sometimes extending to renowned universities.

For instance, the British royal family has a notable tradition of providing their princesses with a combination of prestigious private education and higher education opportunities. Princess Anne, the daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, attended Benenden School, a highly-regarded independent school for girls in Kent. Her daughter, Zara Tindall, followed suit with a similarly comprehensive education, attending Gordonstoun School in Scotland, a notable institution that promotes the development of both academic and extracurricular skills.

Similarly, Princess Diana of Wales, although not a direct princess by birth, received her early education at the Riddlesworth Hall Preparatory School and later at West Heath Girls' School. Her educational journey culminated with a finishing school in Switzerland, an experience shared by many royal figures seeking to polish their cultural and linguistic skills.

In Sweden, Princess Victoria, the Crown Princess, attended the Enskilda Gymnasiet in Stockholm for her secondary education. She then furthered her studies in the United States at Yale University, emphasizing the international aspect of contemporary royal education. Princess Victoria’s academic pursuits extended beyond formal education; she also undertook a customized program of government internships within the Swedish government to prepare for her future role as monarch.

The Spanish Royal Family also places a strong emphasis on education. Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo, attended the esteemed Santa María del Camino School in Madrid, and later pursued higher education at the Complutense University of Madrid, achieving a degree in Education Sciences.

Across different royal families, there is a common thread of ensuring that princesses receive an education that equips them with critical thinking skills, cultural awareness, and social responsibility. This often involves enrolling in institutions known for academic excellence and often includes components that cultivate leadership and public service skills, integral for their potential future roles within the monarchy and broader society.",428.0,1551.0,2032,1.0,0.25,0.43067655807339306,7.322421550750732,0.8481311798095703,9.105683326721191,At home,1.0
"The dry lands of Namibia were inhabited since early times by San, Damara, and Namaqua, and since about the 14th century AD by immigrating Bantu who came with the Bantu expansion. Most of the territory became a German Imperial protectorate in 1884 and remained a German colony until the end of World War I. In 1920, the League of Nations mandated the country to South Africa, which imposed its laws and, from 1948, its apartheid policy. The port of Walvis Bay and the offshore Penguin Islands had been annexed by the Cape Colony under the British crown by 1878 and had become an integral part of the new Union of South Africa at its creation in 1910.",When did South Africa impose the apartheid policy on Namibia?,1948,0,NUM,"When did South Africa impose the apartheid policy on Namibia?

Relevant context: Namibia, formerly known as South West Africa, was subjected to the apartheid policy by South Africa after World War I. Following the defeat of Germany in the war, the League of Nations mandated the territory, then called German South West Africa, to South Africa in 1919. It was under this mandate that South Africa began to administer the region, initially with some degree of oversight from the international community. However, after the dissolution of the League of Nations and the subsequent formation of the United Nations, South Africa sought to annex the territory outright, disregarding calls for it to be placed under U.N. trusteeship.

The official implementation of apartheid policies in Namibia began in earnest after the establishment of the apartheid regime in South Africa in 1948, with the ascension of the National Party to power. The systematic segregation and discriminatory policies that characterized apartheid were enforced by South African authorities in Namibia, leading to widespread disenfranchisement and marginalization of the native population. 

In 1966, following decades of resistance and international pressure, the United Nations General Assembly terminated South Africa's mandate over Namibia, declaring its continued presence illegal. Despite this, South Africa maintained control over the territory and continued to enforce apartheid policies. The imposition of apartheid in Namibia remained until the country achieved independence on March 21, 1990, following a United Nations-supervised transition process. This transition was largely facilitated by the Namibian War of Independence, in which local liberation movements such as the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) played a vital role in resisting South African rule.",330.0,1631.0,2017,1.0,0.16666666666666666,0.3562071871080222,3.828314781188965,1.0034592151641846,5.731602907180786,1948,1.0
"Plymouth's early history extends to the Bronze Age, when a first settlement emerged at Mount Batten. This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire, until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton, now called Plymouth. In 1620, the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony – the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America. During the English Civil War the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646.",In what year did the Pilgrim Fathers sail from Plymouth?,1620,0,NUM,"In what year did the Pilgrim Fathers sail from Plymouth?

Relevant context: The Pilgrim Fathers, a group of English separatists seeking religious freedom, sailed from Plymouth, England, in the year 1620. Their departure was a significant event in early American history. The Pilgrims embarked on their historic journey aboard the Mayflower, a small sailing ship measuring approximately 80 feet in length. After initially departing from Southampton, England, the group encountered various challenges that necessitated a stop in Dartmouth and a subsequent final departure from Plymouth.

Their intended destination was the Virginia Colony; however, the Mayflower was ultimately blown off course, leading to their landing at what is now known as Cape Cod, Massachusetts. This unintended arrival near modern-day Provincetown occurred in November of 1620, after a treacherous voyage that lasted over two months. The Pilgrims faced harsh conditions during their voyage, enduring cramped quarters and limited provisions.

Upon arrival, they established a settlement at Plymouth, Massachusetts, known as Plymouth Colony, which became one of the first successful colonial endeavors in North America. This venture would pave the way for further European colonization in the New World. The legacy of the Pilgrims is often commemorated in the United States during the holiday of Thanksgiving, which marks the assistance of Native Americans in helping the settlers survive their first, challenging winter.

Hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the Clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the Americas were ruled out.",What does the data indicate about the population the individual was from?,directly ancestral,0,NUM,"What does the data indicate about the population the individual was from?

Relevant context: The data suggests that the individual was from a population characterized by a distinct genetic profile and a unique set of cultural practices. Genetic analysis indicates the presence of a rare haplogroup, which is predominantly found in isolated communities in the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. This haplogroup is often associated with a lineage that has relatively low levels of genetic diversity, which is typical for populations that have experienced long periods of geographic or social isolation.

Anthropological data reveals that this population has maintained a strong tradition of agro-pastoralism, relying heavily on sheep herding and the cultivation of hardy cereal crops adapted to high-altitude environments. The population practices a form of slash-and-burn agriculture, which is well-suited to their hilly terrain, allowing for periodic regeneration of forest resources upon which they depend.

Linguistically, the people speak a dialect that is part of a larger family of languages known for their complex phonetic structures and non-standardized written forms. This dialect shows influences from neighboring cultures, suggesting a history of trade and cultural exchange despite their relative isolation.

From a demographic standpoint, historical records indicate a stable population size over several centuries, with migration patterns that have typically seen more people moving out of the community than into it. This is consistent with the economic opportunities being limited within the region, prompting younger generations to seek work in urban areas.

Cultural anthropologists have noted a rich tradition of folk music and dance, which plays a central role in the social life of the population. Festivals and community gatherings often center around these cultural expressions, highlighting the importance of music and dance in maintaining social cohesion and cultural identity.

In summary, the data paints a picture of a population that is genetically distinct, culturally rich, and historically isolated, with a deep connection to their natural environment and traditional lifestyle.",376.0,1688.0,2123,1.0,0.2,0.38685280723454163,3.972979784011841,0.9162759780883789,5.963873386383057,Native American populations,0.0
"Balansiyya had a rebirth of sorts with the beginning of the Taifa of Valencia kingdom in the 11th century.

Relevant context: El Cid, whose full name was Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, did not rule as a sovereign monarch in the traditional sense, but he did wield significant military and political power during the late 11th century in medieval Spain. Born around 1043, El Cid rose to prominence as a Castilian nobleman and military leader.

His most notable period of leadership occurred during his conquest of Valencia. After a series of complex military campaigns and shifting alliances, El Cid managed to take control of Valencia in 1094. He ruled over the city as its lord until his death in 1099. During his rule in Valencia, El Cid established a semi-independent principality, maintaining a balanced relationship with both Christian and Muslim factions in the region at a time marked by the Reconquista—the Christian effort to reclaim parts of the Iberian Peninsula from Muslim rule.

Although El Cid's rule was not officially recognized as a kingship, his strategic and autonomous control over Valencia showcased his adept leadership and considerable influence during this tumultuous period in Spanish history.

"The word ""insect"" comes from the Latin word insectum, meaning ""with a notched or divided body"", or literally ""cut into"", from the neuter singular perfect passive participle of insectare, ""to cut into, to cut up"", from in- ""into"" and secare ""to cut""; because insects appear ""cut into"" three sections. Pliny the Elder introduced the Latin designation as a loan-translation of the Greek word ἔντομος (éntomos) or ""insect"" (as in entomology), which was Aristotle's term for this class of life, also in reference to their ""notched"" bodies. ""Insect"" first appears documented in English in 1601 in Holland's translation of Pliny. Translations of Aristotle's term also form the usual word for ""insect"" in Welsh (trychfil, from trychu ""to cut"" and mil, ""animal""), Serbo-Croatian (zareznik, from rezati, ""to cut""), Russian (насекомое nasekomoje, from seč'/-sekat', ""to cut""), etc.",Insects are cut into how many sections?,three sections,0,NUM,"Insects are cut into how many sections?

Relevant context: Insects, one of the most diverse groups of organisms on Earth, are structurally defined by the division of their bodies into three distinct sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. This tripartite organization is a fundamental characteristic of insects and plays a crucial role in their functionality and adaptability across different environments.

1. **Head**: The head section of an insect houses the brain and is the primary center for sensory perception. It typically includes the antennae, which serve as sensory organs for touch and smell, and compound eyes made up of multiple small lenses that provide a wide field of vision. Additionally, the head contains various mouthparts that are adapted to the insect’s specific feeding habits, ranging from the mandibles of predators to the siphoning proboscis of butterflies.

2. **Thorax**: The thorax, the middle section of the insect's body, is primarily responsible for locomotion. It consists of three segments, each bearing a pair of legs. Insects often also have two pairs of wings attached to the thorax, although some have only one pair or none at all. The musculature within the thorax is highly developed, allowing for the complex movements required for flight and other forms of movement.

3. **Abdomen**: The abdomen is the final section of an insect’s body and contains vital organs associated with digestion, excretion, and reproduction. It is often segmented and can expand or contract, facilitating various physiological processes. The abdomen may also have specialized structures for defense or mating, such as stingers in bees or the ovipositor in certain other insects.

This three-part body plan is integral to the insect’s ability to thrive in diverse ecosystems and contributes to their evolutionary success. Each section serves specialized roles that together ensure the survival and reproduction of insects, enabling them to occupy a wide range of ecological niches.

Understanding these three distinct sections is key to studying entomology and underscores the adaptability and specialization found within the insect class.",412.0,1785.0,2251,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.614591121673584,0.9420130252838135,5.48274040222168,Three sections,0.9

Relevant context: In 1933, the Orthodox Church of Greece formally declared that membership in the Freemasons was incompatible with Orthodox Christian beliefs, characterizing it as an act of apostasy. This decision was made following a comprehensive review by the Holy Synod of the Church, which closely examined the rituals and teachings of Freemasonry in light of Orthodox doctrine. The declaration came amid growing concerns across various Christian denominations about the influence and secrecy associated with the Masonic order. The Church of Greece's pronouncement reflected a broader theological position that Freemasonry's ideals and practices were fundamentally at odds with Orthodox Christian principles, particularly regarding the exclusive devotion required by the faith.

Mythological subjects, or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy, were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design, with strongly emphasized borders. Pliny the Elder mentions the artist Sosus of Pergamon by name, describing his mosaics of the food left on a floor after a feast and of a group of doves drinking from a bowl. Both of these themes were widely copied.",When was the Greek figure style mostly formed?,the 3rd century BC,0,NUM,"When was the Greek figure style mostly formed?

Relevant context: The Greek figure style, particularly in vase painting and sculpture, underwent significant development and reached its most recognized form during the late Archaic and early Classical periods, roughly between the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. This evolution marked a transition from the more abstract and patterned designs of the earlier Geometric and Orientalizing periods to the more naturalistic and realistic depictions of human figures and mythological scenes.

During the 6th century BCE, the Black-Figure technique dominated, wherein artists would paint figures in black slip on the natural red clay of the vase, then incise details to reveal the red beneath. This technique allowed for more intricate and lively depictions, emphasizing narrative scenes from mythology and daily life. A notable center for Black-Figure pottery was Athens, where artists like Exekias and the Amasis Painter gained prominence through their skilled craftsmanship and innovative compositions.

Transitioning into the late 6th and early 5th centuries BCE, the Red-Figure technique was developed, revolutionizing Greek vase painting. With this method, figures were left in the natural red of the clay, while the background was filled in with the black slip. This allowed for greater detail and fluidity in depicting anatomy and movement, as seen in the works of celebrated artists like Euphronios and the Andokides Painter.

Simultaneously, Greek sculpture was also reaching new heights. The Severe Style, which emerged in the early 5th century BCE, began to replace the Archaic smile and rigid poses typical of the earlier era with more naturalistic and dynamic forms. This period laid the groundwork for the Classical style, characterized by the idealized proportions and fluid motion epitomized by the works of sculptors such as Phidias, Polykleitos, and Myron.

In summary, the Greek figure style, particularly in vase painting and sculpture, was primarily formed and refined during the transition between the late Archaic and early Classical periods, with significant advancements occurring from the 6th to the 5th centuries BCE. These developments were marked by a shift towards naturalism, enhancing the portrayal of human figures and establishing foundational techniques and styles that would influence the art world for centuries to come.",459.0,1923.0,2437,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.522702217102051,0.9618220329284668,7.468648910522461,Classical period,0.0

While the banking system evolved in the Low Countries, it was quickly incorporated by the well-connected English, stimulating English economic output.",The Dutch East-India Company inhabited how many cities?,six,0,NUM,"The Dutch East-India Company inhabited how many cities?

Relevant context: The Dutch East India Company (VOC), established in 1602, was one of the most powerful and influential trading companies in history. Although it operated primarily out of the Netherlands, its reach extended across many parts of Asia and beyond, where it effectively controlled a myriad of cities through its trading posts, forts, and colonies. At the peak of its power in the 17th and 18th centuries, the VOC inhabited a significant number of cities across various regions.

In Southeast Asia, Batavia (now Jakarta in Indonesia) served as the VOC’s headquarters, becoming the administrative and commercial hub of its operations. In addition to Batavia, the VOC established key settlements in cities such as Malacca (in present-day Malaysia), which was crucial for controlling regional trade routes, and Galle in Sri Lanka, which served as another important center for trade and ship repair.

Further east in the Indonesian archipelago, the VOC controlled cities like Makassar and Ambon, both of which played critical roles in the spice trade, one of the primary goods in VOC operations. Similarly, in South Asia, the VOC had a presence in Cochin and Nagapattinam on the Indian coast, leveraging these ports to engage in the lucrative spice, textile, and indigo trades.

The company's influence extended even to Japan and China, with a notable VOC settlement on the artificial island of Dejima in Nagasaki, which was the exclusive point of European contact with Japan for over two centuries. In China, the VOC traded from several ports, though its activities were often subject to restrictions imposed by the Chinese Emperor.

In addition to Asia, the VOC's reach included settlements in southern Africa, most famously at the Cape of Good Hope (present-day Cape Town in South Africa), which was established as a replenishing station for ships traveling between Europe and Asia.

Overall, although it is challenging to pinpoint an exact number of cities due to the dynamic nature of its operations and the changing fortunes of its territories, the VOC effectively controlled or heavily influenced dozens of cities as it established a vast, intercontinental trading network. This vast network allowed the VOC to dominate trade between Europe and Asia for a significant period, significantly impacting the economic and political landscapes of the regions involved.",461.0,1480.0,1996,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.062828779220581,0.8787992000579834,7.306252956390381,One,0.0
"Australia had been shocked by the speedy collapse of British Malaya and Fall of Singapore in which around 15,000 Australian soldiers became prisoners of war.

Over the following 19 months, Australia was attacked from the air almost 100 times.",In what year did Japan establish a base in New Guinea?,1942,0,NUM,"In what year did Japan establish a base in New Guinea?

Relevant context: Japan established a military base in New Guinea during World War II as part of its strategic expansion in the Pacific. This event took place in 1942, during the early stages of Japan's aggressive Pacific Campaign. Following their successful attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Japanese forces swiftly moved to expand their control over key territories in Southeast Asia and the Pacific to secure resources and establish a defensive perimeter against Allied forces. 

The Japanese invasion of New Guinea began in early 1942 when they landed on the northern coast of the island. By March of that year, Japanese troops had established a significant base at Rabaul on New Britain, an island to the northeast of mainland New Guinea. This stronghold became a critical hub for Japanese operations in the region, allowing them to project power over the Solomon Islands, the Coral Sea, and further into New Guinea.

As part of their strategic objectives, the Japanese occupied areas of the northeastern coastline of New Guinea, including key locations such as Lae and Salamaua, throughout 1942. These bases provided Japan with vital airfields and ports, enabling them to conduct operations and supply lines critical for supporting their military endeavors in the wider Pacific.

Thus, the establishment of Japanese bases in New Guinea in 1942 marked a significant point in the Pacific War, highlighting Japan’s attempt to fortify its position in the region and deter Allied counterattacks.

Relevant context: The Collegiate School, initially established in Saybrook, Connecticut, underwent a significant transformation in its identity which is closely tied to a notable historical figure and a strategic donation. This transformation was marked by the renaming of the institution to Yale College. The pivotal event occurred in 1718, a year that stands out in the annals of educational history. 

The name change was largely prompted by a generous donation from Elihu Yale, a prosperous merchant and philanthropist, who was born in Boston but spent much of his life in England. His substantial contribution of books and goods, valued at the time at around £800, was intended to support the nascent institution's mission of educating young men in the Connecticut colony. Yale was not merely a financier; his support symbolized a vote of confidence in the Collegiate School's future and ambitions.

Elihu Yale’s gift was further complemented by a consignment of textiles from Governor Cotton Mather, which were of practical use to the fledgling college struggling to maintain financial and material resources sufficient for educational purposes. In gratitude and recognition of his critical support, the trustees decided to rename the Collegiate School to Yale College, a decision that reflected the desire to honor the benefactor and secure prestigious associations for the institution. Thus, 1718 marks the year when the Collegiate School officially became known as Yale College, paving the way for it to evolve into what is known today as Yale University, one of the most prestigious universities in the world, located in New Haven, Connecticut.

"Perhaps foremost among what Whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions was the Cartesian idea that reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally independently of one another, which he rejected in favor of an event-based or ""process"" ontology in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another. He also argued that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential, indeed that everything is constituted by its experience. He used the term ""experience"" very broadly, so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience. In this, he went against Descartes' separation of two different kinds of real existence, either exclusively material or else exclusively mental.

Relevant context: Alfred North Whitehead, a prominent philosopher and mathematician, proposed an alternative to the traditional view of matter in his process philosophy. Instead of considering matter as something that exists independently and is made up of static, isolated entities, Whitehead believed that reality is fundamentally composed of interrelated events or ""actual occasions."" These events are processes rather than substances. In his view, everything in the universe is interconnected and constantly in a process of becoming, influenced by and influencing other events.

Whitehead's notion of reality is characterized by a network of relationships. Every actual occasion is a convergence of influences from the past, which it ""prehends,"" and it contributes to the shaping of future events. This perspective suggests that reality is not a collection of independent particles or pieces of material, but a dynamic tapestry of processes defined by their interactions. Whitehead's philosophy emphasizes that the world is a web of interdependencies, where what matters is not the material itself, but the processes and connections through which reality evolves.

This interconnected view blurs the traditional lines between subject and object, emphasizing the relational nature of all entities.

"The coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 is regarded as a turning point in medieval history, marking a return of the Western Roman Empire, since the new emperor ruled over much of the area previously controlled by the western emperors. It also marks a change in Charlemagne's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state. There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire. The Frankish lands were rural in character, with only a few small cities. Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean. The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts, who administered the counties the empire had been divided into.

"The Rohingya people have consistently faced human rights abuses by the Burmese regime that has refused to acknowledge them as Burmese citizens (despite some of them having lived in Burma for over three generations)—the Rohingya have been denied Burmese citizenship since the enactment of a 1982 citizenship law. The law created three categories of citizenship: citizenship, associate citizenship, and naturalised citizenship. Citizenship is given to those who belong to one of the national races such as Kachin, Kayah (Karenni), Karen, Chin, Burman, Mon, Rakhine, Shan, Kaman, or Zerbadee. Associate citizenship is given to those who cannot prove their ancestors settled in Myanmar before 1823, but can prove they have one grandparent, or pre-1823 ancestor, who was a citizen of another country, as well as people who applied for citizenship in 1948 and qualified then by those laws. Naturalized citizenship is only given to those who have at least one parent with one of these types of Burmese citizenship or can provide ""conclusive evidence"" that their parents entered and resided in Burma prior to independence in 1948. The Burmese regime has attempted to forcibly expel Rohingya and bring in non-Rohingyas to replace them—this policy has resulted in the expulsion of approximately half of the 800,000 Rohingya from Burma, while the Rohingya people have been described as ""among the world's least wanted"" and ""one of the world's most persecuted minorities.""

Relevant context: The plight of the Rohingya people, primarily residing in Myanmar, has led to one of the most significant and ongoing refugee crises in recent history. The origins of this crisis can be traced back to the changes in Myanmar's citizenship laws, particularly the 1982 Citizenship Law. This law effectively rendered the Rohingya stateless by not recognizing them as one of the country's 135 official ethnic groups. This lack of recognition stripped them of citizenship rights, including the right to vote and access to education, employment, and healthcare. 

Over the decades, these legal changes have compounded the marginalization and persecution of the Rohingya, with the situation deteriorating significantly in recent years. The systematic denial of citizenship and the ensuing human rights abuses have forced the Rohingya to seek refuge in other countries. 

As of 2023, it is estimated that over 900,000 Rohingya have become refugees, primarily residing in overcrowded camps in Bangladesh, such as the Kutupalong refugee camp, which is the largest refugee settlement in the world. This mass displacement was exacerbated by the violence that erupted in Rakhine State in 2017, prompting a mass exodus of Rohingya from Myanmar in order to escape brutal military crackdowns.

The impact of these changes in citizenship and the subsequent refugee crisis is profound, affecting not only the displaced individuals but also the host countries and international agencies tasked with providing humanitarian assistance. The situation remains dire, with little progress made toward repatriation or granting the Rohingya full citizenship rights, leaving hundreds of thousands in a state of limbo, without a permanent home or legal status.

Relevant context: The period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Ludwig van Beethoven is commonly referred to as the ""Classical Period"" in Western art music. This era approximately spans from 1730 to 1820 and marks a time of significant transformation and development in music, characterized by a move away from the intricate polyphony of the Baroque period towards a style that emphasized clear structure, proportion, and balance.

Johann Sebastian Bach, whose death in 1750 often marks the traditional end of the Baroque era, was a master of complex counterpoint and elaborate musical forms. His work serves as a culmination of Baroque musical styles and techniques. The transition from Baroque to Classical is marked by figures such as Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, one of Bach's sons, and Christoph Willibald Gluck, who were key in developing the new stylistic approaches that set the foundation for the Classical era.

The Classical period itself is dominated by the works of composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, and Ludwig van Beethoven. This era emphasized music that was lighter, clearer in texture, and more dependent on balance and form than its Baroque predecessors. The Classical era introduced the development of sonata form, the rise of the symphony and the string quartet, and a preference for homophonic texture rather than the polyphony of the Baroque.

Ludwig van Beethoven, active primarily during the late Classical period, is often viewed as a transitional figure between the Classical and Romantic eras. His early works are grounded in Classical traditions, but he later pushed the boundaries of form, expressiveness, and sonority, paving the way for the Romantic composers who followed him.

Throughout this era, music became increasingly accessible to the general public, with the growing presence of public concerts and a shift away from the exclusive patronage system. The Classical period's emphasis on clarity, order, and balanced expression reflects broader Enlightenment ideals, which celebrated reason and individualism.

In summary, the Classical Period from Bach to Beethoven represents a pivotal chapter in the history of Western music, characterized by a harmonious blend of technical precision and expressive beauty, profoundly influencing future generations of composers.",451.0,1441.0,1954,1.0,0.16666666666666666,0.3562071871080222,4.942986011505127,0.8867778778076172,6.758437633514404,Golden age,0.9

Yet in spite of the extensive territories held by the Habsburgs, the Empire itself remained fragmented, and much real power and influence lay with the individual principalities. In addition, financial institutions, such as the Hanseatic League and the Fugger family, held great power, on both economic and a political levels.",In what year did a Golden Bull make the king of Bohemia first among the imperial electors?,1356,0,NUM,"In what year did a Golden Bull make the king of Bohemia first among the imperial electors?

Relevant context: The Golden Bull of 1356, issued by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, was an essential constitutional document for the Holy Roman Empire that detailed the process of electing the emperor. This decree, established during a series of diets in Nuremberg and Metz, codified the system by which a select group of princes, known as electors, would have the exclusive right to elect the King of the Romans, who could later become emperor.

One significant provision of the Golden Bull was the enhancement of the status of certain electors. Among these, the King of Bohemia, who was an elector by virtue of his title, saw an elevation in his standing. The Bull explicitly prioritized the King of Bohemia, giving him the premier position among the seven electors. This meant that during the ceremonial proceedings of electing a new emperor, the King of Bohemia was granted the right to vote first.

This restructuring underscored the political importance of the Bohemian crown within the Holy Roman Empire and acknowledged the influential dynasty of the Luxembourgs, to which Emperor Charles IV himself belonged. By reinforcing the precedence of the Bohemian elector, the Golden Bull not only solidified the role of Bohemia within the imperial electoral process but also highlighted its prominence in the broader political landscape of the time.

Hence, the Golden Bull of 1356 marked the year when the king of Bohemia was recognized as first among the imperial electors, setting a lasting precedent for the electoral hierarchy within the Holy Roman Empire.",329.0,1464.0,1859,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.291545391082764,1.0059688091278076,7.424996852874756,1356,1.0
"Catalan evolved from Vulgar Latin around the eastern Pyrenees in the 9th century. During the Low Middle Ages it saw a golden age as the literary and dominant language of the Crown of Aragon, and was widely used all over the Mediterranean. The union of Aragon with the other territories of Spain in 1479 marked the start of the decline of the language. In 1659 Spain ceded Northern Catalonia to France, and Catalan was banned in both states in the early 18th century. 19th-century Spain saw a Catalan literary revival, which culminated in the 1913 orthographic standardization, and the officialization of the language during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–39). However, the Francoist dictatorship (1939–75) banned the language again.",When was Catalan's Golden Age as a dominant language?,Low Middle Ages,0,NUM,"When was Catalan's Golden Age as a dominant language?

Relevant context: The Catalan Golden Age, a period of cultural, political, and economic prosperity, is marked as the era when Catalan emerged as a dominant language across the realms of the Crown of Aragon. This flourishing period began in the late Middle Ages, roughly spanning from the 13th to the 15th centuries. During these centuries, Catalan was not only the primary language of the expanding Crown of Aragon but also a significant language of literature, law, and diplomacy in the Mediterranean world.

The ascent of Catalan as a dominant language can be traced back to the political rise of the Crown of Aragon, which, by the 14th century, controlled a sizable portion of the Mediterranean including territories such as the Kingdom of Majorca, the Kingdom of Valencia, and even parts of Italy like Sicily and Sardinia. With this expansion, Catalan became more widely spoken and used as an administrative language, facilitating governance across these diverse territories.

The cultural impact of this era is notably reflected in the rich body of Catalan literature that was produced. The 15th century, in particular, is renowned for its literary achievements, including the works of Ausiàs March, a prominent poet, and Joanot Martorell, whose chivalric romance ""Tirant lo Blanc"" is considered a masterpiece. Catalan writers and scholars were involved in the creation of notable chronicles and historical works that have survived to this day.

Furthermore, Catalan was the language of commerce and trade, as the region’s bustling economy necessitated widespread communication and documentation. Major Catalan port cities like Barcelona thrived as hubs of trade, drawing merchants from across the Mediterranean. The language served as a crucial instrument for maritime navigation and business negotiations, further cementing its role as a lingua franca of commerce during this time.

The decline of Catalan's preeminence began towards the end of the 15th century as political changes shifted the center of power to Castile, exemplified by the dynastic union through the marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, which led to the eventual unification of Spain. This shift gradually diminished the use of Catalan in official capacities as Spanish began to supplant it.

In summary, Catalan's Golden Age occurred from the 13th to the 15th centuries, characterized by its wide use across the Mediterranean territories of the Crown of Aragon as a dominant language of administration, literature, and trade. This period left a lasting legacy on Catalan culture and history before political changes began to reduce the use of Catalan in favor of Spanish.",537.0,1261.0,1856,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,6.276831388473511,1.2199680805206299,8.619722127914429,Low Middle Ages,1.0

Relevant context: The query regarding the number of samurai involved in defending Japan against the Yuan invasions touches on a historically significant event that took place in the late 13th century. The Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty, under the rule of Kublai Khan, attempted to invade Japan twice, first in 1274 and again in 1281. These invasions were met with staunch resistance from the Japanese forces, largely comprised of samurai warriors.

The first invasion in 1274 saw an estimated force of around 23,000 Mongolian, Chinese, and Korean soldiers landing in Japan. The Japanese resistance, though outnumbered, was composed of local samurai and other warriors. Despite being relatively small in number, these samurai were skilled in combat and were familiar with the terrain, which contributed to their ability to engage the invading forces effectively. However, exact historical records on the specific number of samurai involved are scarce, making it difficult to provide an exact figure. Sources suggest that the Japanese forces, including samurai and other local defenders, amounted to roughly a few thousand warriors who managed to hold off the invaders until a sudden storm caused significant damage to the Yuan fleet, forcing them to retreat.

The second and larger invasion in 1281 involved an even greater force of reportedly 140,000 troops. Japan's defense strategy relied heavily on samurai-led forces, who used guerrilla tactics and took advantage of fortifications built along the coastline since the earlier invasion. Again, historical records do not provide a precise number of samurai, but estimates suggest that tens of thousands of Japanese warriors participated in defensive efforts. The fabled ""kamikaze,"" or ""divine wind,"" which was a powerful typhoon, played a crucial role in destroying much of the Yuan fleet, ensuring the invaders could not regroup and launch a sustainable occupation of Japan.

In summary, while exact numbers of samurai present during the Yuan invasions are not definitively known, it is clear that thousands of these skilled warriors, alongside additional Japanese troops and defending forces, played a crucial role in defending their homeland. The defense not only relied on the martial prowess of the samurai but also benefited from fortuitous weather conditions that significantly hampered the invading forces.",466.0,2743.0,3269,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.108191967010498,1.1573331356048584,8.445122003555298,"10,000 samurai",0.5

However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon, all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (sibutu) indicates a Babylonian origin.",When were Greek festivals celebrated?,at the full moon,0,NUM,"When were Greek festivals celebrated?

Relevant context: Greek festivals were an integral part of ancient Greek culture and were celebrated throughout the year to honor various gods and goddesses, as well as to mark important seasonal and agricultural events. Each city-state in Greece had its own unique calendar and festivities, but some festivals were widespread and held great significance across the Hellenic world.

One of the most famous and panhellenic festivals was the Olympic Games, held every four years in honor of Zeus. The Games took place in Olympia, beginning in 776 BCE, usually in the month of Hekatombaion (equivalent to late July and early August in the modern calendar). The festival attracted participants from all over Greece and was a time of peace, where even warring city-states would declare a truce to allow safe passage for athletes and spectators.

Another significant festival was the Dionysia, dedicated to Dionysus, the god of wine, fertility, and theater. The Greater Dionysia, or City Dionysia, was celebrated in Athens every March and was a major theatrical event, featuring competitions in tragedy and comedy where famous playwrights such as Sophocles and Aristophanes premiered their works. The Lesser Dionysia, occurring in late autumn, was less grand but still an important rural festival.

The Panathenaic Festival, another Athenian event, was held every four years to honor Athena, the city's patron goddess. Celebrated in mid-summer, the festival included a grand procession to the Acropolis, athletic competitions, and a ritual presentation of a specially woven peplos garment to Athena.

The Eleusinian Mysteries, arguably one of the most enigmatic religious festivals, were held annually in Eleusis near Athens, likely in September, to honor Demeter and Persephone. Celebrants took part in secret rites that were believed to offer insights into the mysteries of life and death.

Other notable festivals included the Pythian Games in Delphi, dedicated to Apollo and held every four years, and the Nemean and Isthmian Games, which similarly featured athletic and cultural competitions.

Greek festivals were not only religious events; they were vital social and political gatherings that reinforced community bonds and cultural identity. Through these diverse celebrations, the Greeks expressed their piety, showcased their artistic achievements, and engaged in diplomacy. As a result, festivals were strategically timed throughout the calendar year, reflecting both the agrarian cycles and the need for communal rejuvenation and celebration.",501.0,2007.0,2561,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.568310022354126,1.6336748600006104,7.372931003570557,8th century BC,0.0
"Following the Fall of Constantinople on 29 May 1453, many Greeks sought better employment and education opportunities by leaving for the West, particularly Italy, Central Europe, Germany and Russia. Greeks are greatly credited for the European cultural revolution, later called, the Renaissance. In Greek-inhabited territory itself, Greeks came to play a leading role in the Ottoman Empire, due in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on Western Thrace and Greek Macedonia, both in Northern Greece, and of course was centred on the mainly Greek-populated, former Byzantine capital, Constantinople. As a direct consequence of this situation, Greek-speakers came to play a hugely important role in the Ottoman trading and diplomatic establishment, as well as in the church. Added to this, in the first half of the Ottoman period men of Greek origin made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman army, navy, and state bureaucracy, having been levied as adolescents (along with especially Albanians and Serbs) into Ottoman service through the devshirme. Many Ottomans of Greek (or Albanian or Serb) origin were therefore to be found within the Ottoman forces which governed the provinces, from Ottoman Egypt, to Ottomans occupied Yemen and Algeria, frequently as provincial governors.",When did the emperor Constantine  lose rule over in 1453 ?,Fall of Constantinople on 29 May 1453,0,NUM,"When did the emperor Constantine  lose rule over in 1453 ?

Relevant context: Certainly! Here's a detailed hypothetical passage that could perfectly answer the query:

Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos was the last reigning Byzantine emperor, and his rule came to a tragic end on May 29, 1453, marking the fall of Constantinople. Constantine XI had ascended to the throne in 1449, following the death of his brother, John VIII Palaiologos. During his reign, he faced the formidable rise of the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Mehmed II, who was determined to capture Constantinople and bring an end to the Byzantine Empire.

The siege of Constantinople began in early April 1453, as Mehmed II deployed a massive and well-equipped army, including formidable artillery, to breach the city's mighty walls. Despite being outnumbered and undersupplied, Constantine and his defenders, who included both native Byzantines and a small contingent of foreign allies, resisted bravely for several weeks. Constantine XI is often remembered for his leadership during this dire period, rallying his forces and desperately seeking aid from Western Europe, though little substantial help arrived in time.

On the fateful day of May 29, 1453, the Ottoman forces launched an all-out attack. The breach was finally achieved through a section of the walls that had been damaged by relentless cannon fire. According to historical accounts, Emperor Constantine XI chose to don regular soldiers' attire, cast off his imperial regalia, and fight alongside his men in a final defiant act. He perished in the ensuing chaos, effectively ending his rule and that of the Byzantine Empire. The city of Constantinople was captured, and Sultan Mehmed II made it the new capital of the Ottoman Empire, which marked a profound turning point in world history and the close of the medieval Byzantine legacy.

Thus, Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos lost control of his empire on that decisive day—May 29, 1453—transforming the political and cultural landscape of the region forever.",414.0,1653.0,2127,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.166699171066284,1.0390534400939941,6.301017761230469,Constantinople,0.5
"In response to the 1966 ruling by the International Court of Justice, South-West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) military wing, People's Liberation Army of Namibia, a guerrilla group began their armed struggle for independence, but it was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its occupation of Namibia, in accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire region. During the South African occupation of Namibia, white commercial farmers, most of whom came as settlers from South Africa and represented 0.2% of the national population, owned 74% of the arable land. Outside the central-southern area of Namibia (known as the ""Police Zone"" since the German era and which contained the main towns, industries, mines and best arable land), the country was divided into ""homelands"", the version of South African bantustan applied to Namibia, although only a few were actually established because indigenous Namibians often did not cooperate.",When did a guerrilla group fight for Namibia's independence? ,1966,0,NUM,"When did a guerrilla group fight for Namibia's independence? 

Relevant context: The guerrilla group that fought for Namibia's independence was the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), specifically its armed wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). SWAPO was founded in 1960 as a liberation movement, initially advocating for political and social reforms in Namibia, which was then administered by South Africa under the name South West Africa. As South Africa refused to relinquish control and continued to enforce apartheid policies, SWAPO's struggle escalated into a military conflict.

The armed struggle for Namibia's independence began on August 26, 1966. This date is significant as it marks the Battle of Omugulugwombashe, where SWAPO guerrillas engaged in their first armed conflict with South African security forces. The People's Liberation Army of Namibia waged a protracted guerrilla warfare campaign that targeted South African military installations, infrastructure, and communication lines. This armed struggle continued for over two decades.

The conflict was characterized by skirmishes in the northern regions of Namibia, particularly along the border areas with Angola, where SWAPO had established bases, benefitting from the support of other newly independent African nations and the Soviet Union during the Cold War era. PLAN cadres received training and logistical support from these allies, which proved crucial in sustaining their campaign.

International pressure on South Africa increased over the years, with the United Nations declaring South Africa's administration of Namibia illegal and calling for Namibian independence. Despite the challenges, SWAPO maintained its military and diplomatic efforts until Namibia gained independence on March 21, 1990. The struggle spearheaded by SWAPO and PLAN is a pivotal chapter in Namibia's history, celebrating the resilience and determination of the Namibian people to achieve self-determination and end oppressive colonial rule.",376.0,1733.0,2166,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.080342054367065,1.0899121761322021,7.290280342102051,1966,1.0
"The American people are mostly multi-ethnic descendants of various culturally distinct immigrant groups, many of which have now developed nations. Some consider themselves multiracial, while acknowledging race as a social construct. Creolization, assimilation and integration have been continuing processes. The African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968) and other social movements since the mid-twentieth century worked to achieve social justice and equal enforcement of civil rights under the constitution for all ethnicities. In the 2000s, less than 5% of the population identified as multiracial. In many instances, mixed racial ancestry is so far back in an individual's family history (for instance, before the Civil War or earlier), that it does not affect more recent ethnic and cultural identification.",What does affect recent identification in many cases?,mixed racial ancestry,0,NUM,"What does affect recent identification in many cases?

Relevant context: Recent identification in many cases is significantly affected by advancements in technology, particularly in the fields of biometrics and genetic analysis. The introduction of sophisticated facial recognition systems and fingerprint analysis has revolutionized the way authorities identify individuals. In particular, facial recognition software uses complex algorithms to map facial features and compare them against large databases, increasing accuracy and speed in identification efforts.

Moreover, the proliferation of mobile devices equipped with high-resolution cameras has made capturing high-quality images more accessible, which enhances the efficacy of these identification methods. Law enforcement agencies increasingly rely on digital evidence, which can be quickly shared and analyzed across jurisdictions to identify suspects who might otherwise remain anonymous.

Another critical factor affecting recent identification processes is the integration of machine learning techniques. These techniques allow computer systems to improve over time by learning from vast datasets, thereby minimizing errors that were once common with more traditional methods of identification. For example, deep learning models can analyze patterns in voice recognition software or handwriting, aiding in identifying individuals even when other biometric data is not available.

In addition to technological advancements, legal and procedural changes have also played a role. Many countries have updated their identification protocols and databases, promoting international collaboration through treaties and agreements that facilitate the sharing of data across borders. This global cooperation is crucial in tackling transnational crimes and terrorism.

Privacy concerns and ethical considerations are also influencing identification processes. Regulations like the GDPR in the European Union have necessitated the development of systems that protect personal data while still maintaining the efficiency of identification protocols. As a result, many organizations are implementing privacy-preserving techniques, such as anonymization and data encryption, to ensure that individuals' rights are respected.

In summary, recent changes in identification efforts can be largely attributed to technological advancements, improved international cooperation, and a growing emphasis on privacy and data protection. These elements collectively enhance the ability of authorities to identify individuals accurately and efficiently, while also addressing the ethical concerns associated with these technologies.",393.0,1773.0,2221,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.307846307754517,1.2208209037780762,6.728929042816162,Racial categories,0.5
"The Gregorian calendar was a reform of the Julian calendar instituted in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by papal bull Inter gravissimas dated 24 February 1582. The motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church. Although a recommendation of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 specified that all Christians should celebrate Easter on the same day, it took almost five centuries before virtually all Christians achieved that objective by adopting the rules of the Church of Alexandria (see Easter for the issues which arose).",When was the Gregorian Calendar introduced?,1582,0,NUM,"When was the Gregorian Calendar introduced?

Relevant context: The Gregorian Calendar was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in October 1582. This reform was implemented to address inaccuracies in the previously used Julian Calendar, which had been in place since its introduction by Julius Caesar in 45 BCE. The main issue with the Julian Calendar was its miscalculation of the solar year by 11 minutes annually, causing the calendar dates to drift gradually away from the equinoxes and solstices.

To implement the Gregorian Calendar, ten days were omitted from the month of October 1582. Thus, the day following Thursday, October 4, 1582, was declared Friday, October 15, 1582. This adjustment realigned the calendar with the seasons. In addition to omitting the days, the new calendar introduced a refined leap year rule: a year would be a leap year if it were divisible by four, but not if it were divisible by 100, unless it was also divisible by 400. This correction calculated the average year length more precisely, improving alignment with the Earth's revolutions around the Sun.

The adoption of the Gregorian Calendar was immediate in predominantly Catholic countries like Italy, Spain, and Portugal. However, Protestant and Orthodox countries were slower to adopt the new system due to religious and political resistance. For instance, Great Britain and its American colonies only adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752, whereby an additional 11 days were omitted from September of that year.

The Gregorian Calendar has since become the civil calendar used by most of the world due to its accuracy and international adoption, allowing for standardized timekeeping globally. Its introduction marked a significant turning point in chronology and calendar reform, correcting existing timekeeping errors and setting a framework for modern date tracking.",353.0,1448.0,1853,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.522983551025391,0.9939479827880859,6.7196855545043945,1582,1.0
"Interracial relations between Indigenous Americans and African Americans is a part of American history that has been neglected. The earliest record of African and Indigenous American relations in the Americas occurred in April 1502, when the first Africans kidnapped were brought to Hispaniola to serve as slaves. Some escaped, and somewhere inland on Santo Domingo, the first Black Indians were born. In addition, an example of African slaves' escaping from European colonists and being absorbed by Indigenous Americans occurred as far back as 1526. In June of that year, Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon established a Spanish colony near the mouth of the Pee Dee River in what is now eastern South Carolina. The Spanish settlement was named San Miguel de Gualdape. Amongst the settlement were 100 enslaved Africans. In 1526, the first African slaves fled the colony and took refuge with local Indigenous Americans.",How many slaves were at San Miguel de Gualdape at its inception?,100 enslaved Africans,0,NUM,"How many slaves were at San Miguel de Gualdape at its inception?

Relevant context: San Miguel de Gualdape, established in 1526, holds the distinction of being the first European settlement in what is now the United States. Situated near the present-day coastal region of Georgia or South Carolina, the colony was founded by the Spanish explorer Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón. At its inception, the settlement was notable not only for being an early European foothold on the North American mainland but also for its diverse population, which included a significant number of enslaved Africans.

According to historical accounts, Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón led an expedition comprised of around 600 settlers, among whom approximately 100 were African slaves. These enslaved individuals were brought along as part of the labor force intended to support the fledgling colony. The inclusion of such a substantial number of enslaved people reflects the early integration of African slavery into the colonial practices of European powers in the New World.

The colony of San Miguel de Gualdape faced numerous challenges, including harsh environmental conditions, diseases, and conflicts with indigenous peoples. These adversities ultimately led to its abandonment after a few months. Nevertheless, the establishment of San Miguel de Gualdape and the presence of enslaved Africans at the outset highlight the early and enduring impact of slavery on the colonial history of the Americas.

"Depopulation, deurbanisation, invasion, and movement of peoples, which had begun in Late Antiquity, continued in the Early Middle Ages. The barbarian invaders, including various Germanic peoples, formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire. In the 7th century, North Africa and the Middle East—once part of the Eastern Roman Empire—came under the rule of the Caliphate, an Islamic empire, after conquest by Muhammad's successors. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break with Antiquity was not complete. The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire survived in the east and remained a major power. The empire's law code, the Code of Justinian, was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages. In the West, most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions. Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued. The Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty, briefly established the Carolingian Empire during the later 8th and early 9th century. It covered much of Western Europe, but later succumbed to the pressures of internal civil wars combined with external invasions—Vikings from the north, Magyars from the east, and Saracens from the south.",In what year did Italians discover the Code of Justinian?,1070,0,NUM,"In what year did Italians discover the Code of Justinian?

Relevant context: The discovery of the Code of Justinian, also known as the Corpus Juris Civilis, by Italians is a pivotal moment in the history of Western legal tradition. This comprehensive legal codification was originally commissioned by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century, specifically between 529 and 534 AD. However, its existence was largely forgotten in Western Europe during the early medieval period.

The revival of interest in Justinian's Code occurred in the late 11th century, amidst the intellectual and cultural resurgence known as the Renaissance of the 12th century. Italians, particularly scholars and jurists at the University of Bologna, played a crucial role in this rediscovery and subsequent dissemination. The year 1070 is often cited as a significant date, as it marks the period when the legal glossator Irnerius is believed to have initiated the systematic study of the Digest, one of the four parts of Justinian's Code, at Bologna.

This rediscovery did not occur as a singular event but rather as part of a gradual scholarly movement. Over the following decades, the renewed study of Roman law by Italian scholars helped lay the foundation for the development of civil law systems across Europe. The academic efforts of the so-called ""Glossators,"" who painstakingly annotated and interpreted the ancient texts, were instrumental in reintroducing Roman legal principles to medieval Europe.

By the late 12th century, the influence of Justinian's Code had become pervasive across Italian legal studies and beyond, leading to its integration into the legal frameworks of many European countries. This period marked the beginning of a crucial transformation in European jurisprudence, heavily influenced by the discoveries and interpretations made by Italian jurists over a century earlier.",361.0,1734.0,2153,1.0,0.16666666666666666,0.3562071871080222,4.423148155212402,0.9971873760223389,6.413261890411377,1070,1.0

The Census Bureau notes that these classifications are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological. Most African Americans also have European ancestry in varying amounts; a lesser proportion have some Native American ancestry. For instance, genetic studies of African Americans show an ancestry that is on average 17–18% European.",What percentage of African Americans have European ancestry?,17–18%,0,NUM,"What percentage of African Americans have European ancestry?

Relevant context: A significant percentage of African Americans have European ancestry due to the complex history of the United States. According to genetic studies and historical records, it is estimated that on average, approximately 20-25% of the genetic makeup of African Americans can be traced back to European ancestors. This European ancestry primarily originates from the interactions between enslaved Africans and European settlers during and after the transatlantic slave trade era. These interactions were often the result of non-consensual relationships and systemic power imbalances, leading to the mixing of African and European genetic lines.

Research conducted through DNA analysis and genealogy testing has confirmed this admixture. For instance, a detailed study by 23andMe in 2015, which analyzed the genetic data of over 160,000 people, found that while the proportion of European ancestry varied geographically, with African Americans in the southern United States often showing higher percentages than those in the north, the presence of European genes was widespread among African American populations across the country.

Additionally, the extent of European ancestry can vary widely from individual to individual, with some African Americans having little to no European heritage and others possessing a much higher percentage than the average. This genetic variance underscores the diverse and rich ancestral backgrounds within African American communities.

It's important to note that these genetic findings reflect broader histories of migration, social dynamics, and systemic racism, which have all contributed to the current genetic landscape of African Americans. Today, as genetic testing becomes more accessible, many people are exploring their ancestry in greater detail, uncovering the nuanced stories of their heritage that DNA can reveal.

"For those that remained under the Ottoman Empire's millet system, religion was the defining characteristic of national groups (milletler), so the exonym ""Greeks"" (Rumlar from the name Rhomaioi) was applied by the Ottomans to all members of the Orthodox Church, regardless of their language or ethnic origin. The Greek speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves Romioi, (as opposed to being so named by others) and, at least those educated, considered their ethnicity (genos) to be Hellenic. There were, however, many Greeks who escaped the second-class status of Christians inherent in the Ottoman millet system, according to which Muslims were explicitly awarded senior status and preferential treatment. These Greeks either emigrated, particularly to their fellow Greek Orthodox protector, the Russian Empire, or simply converted to Islam, often only very superficially and whilst remaining crypto-Christian. The most notable examples of large-scale conversion to Turkish Islam among those today defined as Greek Muslims - excluding those who had to convert as a matter of course on being recruited through the devshirme - were to be found in Crete (Cretan Turks), Greek Macedonia (for example among the Vallahades of western Macedonia), and among Pontic Greeks in the Pontic Alps and Armenian Highlands. Several Ottoman sultans and princes were also of part Greek origin, with mothers who were either Greek concubines or princesses from Byzantine noble families, one famous example being sultan Selim the Grim, whose mother Gülbahar Hatun was a Pontic Greek.",How were the population factions of the Ottoman Empire classified ?,religion was the defining characteristic of national groups,0,NUM,"How were the population factions of the Ottoman Empire classified ?

Relevant context: The population of the Ottoman Empire, which spanned across large portions of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa from the 14th to the early 20th century, was extremely diverse and comprised many different ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups. The Ottoman Empire classified its population largely through the millet system, which was an administrative division that granted a certain degree of autonomy to various religious communities.

Under the millet system, people were classified based on their religion rather than ethnicity or language. The main millets were defined for Muslims, Christians (primarily Eastern Orthodox and Armenians), and Jews. Each millet operated under its own religious laws and retained a level of communal self-governance. This system allowed each religious community to handle its own civil affairs, such as marriage, divorce, education, and religious practice, largely independent of the state. Each millet was headed by its own religious hierarch, such as a Patriarch for Orthodox Christians or a Chief Rabbi for Jews, who acted as intermediary with the Ottoman government and was responsible for tax collection and maintaining order within the community.

Muslims, as the dominant group in the Ottoman Empire, were not part of the millet system in the same way as non-Muslims. They were considered part of the ruling class, and their social status was inherently linked to the Islamic identity of the state. This led to political and social privileges that were not extended to non-Muslim communities.

Ethnicity played a secondary role in classification within the Empire, although it often intersected with religious identity. Slavic Muslims in the Balkans, Arabs in the Levant, and Turks in Anatolia were all considered part of the Muslim populace. Meanwhile, ethnic Greeks, Armenians, and other Christian groups in the same regions were part of Christian millets regardless of their ethnic origin.

The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw significant reforms, beginning with the Tanzimat period, which sought to modernize and centralize the administration of the Empire. The introduction of the concept of Ottomanism attempted to diminish religious and ethnic disparities by promoting a common Ottoman identity; however, it struggled to gain widespread acceptance due to deeply ingrained communal identities. The classification of the population underwent changes in this period as the Empire grappled with nationalism rising among its various subject peoples.

In summary, the Ottoman Empire's classification of its population was primarily based on religious lines through the millet system, with communal autonomy granted to significant religious groups while maintaining Muslim preeminace. Ethnicity and language were present but more fluid categories that played a secondary role to religion in the everyday sociopolitical structure of the Empire.",540.0,2014.0,2610,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,6.025227308273315,1.1969118118286133,8.171218872070312,By religion,0.5

Within the context of the four noble truths, the origin of dukkha is commonly explained as craving (Pali: tanha) conditioned by ignorance (Pali: avijja). On a deeper level, the root cause of dukkha is identified as ignorance (Pali: avijja) of the true nature of things.

Relevant context: The Third Noble Truth in Buddhism is the truth of the cessation of suffering, known in Pali as ""Nirodha."" This truth states that there is a way to end suffering and attain peace and enlightenment, which is achieved by relinquishing attachment and desire. In Buddhist philosophy, suffering arises due to craving and attachment, and the end of suffering can be attained by letting go of these desires.

Nirodha emphasizes the possibility of liberation and the cessation of suffering through spiritual practice and understanding. This cessation is not merely an end to the current experience of suffering but a profound state of peace and liberation called ""Nirvana."" Nirvana is considered the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice, where ignorance is overcome, and one is released from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara).

The Third Noble Truth suggests that by following the path of renunciation, wisdom, ethical conduct, and meditation (as outlined in the Fourth Noble Truth, the Noble Eightfold Path), one can directly experience and achieve the end of suffering. It teaches that the cessation of suffering is achievable here and now, within this very lifetime, given the appropriate dedication and practice.

Understanding Nirodha involves deeply realizing the nature of reality and the impermanence of all things. By understanding and experiencing the cessation of craving, individuals can realize the unconditioned state that is free from suffering and attains a sense of profound peace and contentment.

Relevant context: When Australia was colonized, primarily beginning with the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, several key establishments and significant changes ensued, impacting both the new settlers and the Indigenous populations. The British established the first penal colony at Port Jackson, which is in present-day Sydney, New South Wales, under the leadership of Captain Arthur Phillip. This marked the founding of the Colony of New South Wales, essentially laying the groundwork for British sovereignty on the continent.

The establishment of convict settlements was a major aspect of colonization, as the British sought to alleviate overcrowding in their prisons by transporting convicts to Australia. Over time, these settlements expanded and new ones were established across different parts of the continent, including Hobart in present-day Tasmania (then Van Diemen's Land) and Melbourne in Victoria.

Colonization also led to the establishment of a colonial government. Initially, the colony was governed by a governor sent from Britain, who had significant authority over the colony's affairs. The legal system followed British law, and new infrastructure was developed to support the colonial administration and its expansion.

Commercial establishments began to form as land was allocated to settlers, and agriculture and farming became central to the colony's economy. The introduction of non-native plants and animals dramatically altered the Australian landscape and its ecosystems.

Furthermore, colonization had a profound impact on Indigenous Australian populations. The expansion of settlements and the introduction of new land use practices led to the disruption of traditional ways of life. There were significant conflicts and the widespread displacement of Indigenous communities, along with devastating effects from introduced diseases to which Indigenous Australians had no immunity.

In summary, the colonization of Australia established a new penal colony system, introduced British legal and governance structures, initiated agricultural and commercial development, and led to profound changes for Indigenous populations.

After Victoria's death, her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, was appointed her literary executor. Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned the originals in the process. Despite this destruction, much of the diaries still exist. In addition to Beatrice's edited copy, Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them. Part of Victoria's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A. C.

Relevant context: Her journal, a meticulous record of her thoughts and daily life, spanned an impressive fifteen volumes. She began her journaling journey at the age of twelve and continued almost unerringly until her seventy-fifth birthday. Each volume was bound in a distinct color, chosen to reflect the overarching theme or mood of that particular year. Early volumes, characterized by youthful exuberance, are filled with illustrations and pressed flowers, while the later ones are dense with reflections, memoir-style narratives, and insights garnered over a lifetime. 

The volumes collectively contain an estimated 7,500 pages of detailed entries. Each entry varied in length, from short daily notes to long, introspective compositions that filled several pages. In total, her journaling practice spanned over six decades, capturing personal milestones, historical events, and evolving philosophies.

"During his brief majority reign, Murad IV (1612–1640) reasserted central authority and recaptured Iraq (1639) from the Safavids. The resulting Treaty of Zuhab of that same year decisively parted the Caucasus and adjacent regions between the two neighbouring empires as it had already been defined in the 1555 Peace of Amasya. The Sultanate of women (1648–1656) was a period in which the mothers of young sultans exercised power on behalf of their sons. The most prominent women of this period were Kösem Sultan and her daughter-in-law Turhan Hatice, whose political rivalry culminated in Kösem's murder in 1651. During the Köprülü Era (1656–1703), effective control of the Empire was exercised by a sequence of Grand Viziers from the Köprülü family. The Köprülü Vizierate saw renewed military success with authority restored in Transylvania, the conquest of Crete completed in 1669, and expansion into Polish southern Ukraine, with the strongholds of Khotyn and Kamianets-Podilskyi and the territory of Podolia ceding to Ottoman control in 1676.",When was Kösem murdered?,1651,0,NUM,"When was Kösem murdered?

Relevant context: Kösem Sultan, one of the most powerful women in the history of the Ottoman Empire, was murdered on September 2, 1651. Her rise to power began as the favorite consort of Sultan Ahmed I and continued as she became the Valide Sultan, or Queen Mother, for her sons Murad IV and Ibrahim I. Known for her political acumen and influence, Kösem played a crucial role in the governance of the empire, acting as regent for her sons due to their youth at the time of their ascensions to the throne.

Her murder marked a violent turning point in the political landscape of the empire. The circumstances around her death were intricate and rooted in the court's political intrigues. By 1651, Kösem had been a regent twice and was a formidable force in Ottoman politics. However, her influence waned with the rise of her daughter-in-law, Turhan Sultan, the mother of Mehmed IV. A power struggle ensued between Kösem and Turhan over control of the empire and the future of their respective descendants.

Kösem was ultimately assassinated in the Topkapi Palace, allegedly strangled by agents of the palace or possibly by a curtain, though accounts vary. Turhan Sultan is often implicated as orchestrating the murder, seeking to eliminate Kösem as a political rival and secure her son's throne. This event not only led to Kösem's demise but also signaled the end of an era where the role of women in Ottoman politics had reached unprecedented heights.

"During the Eastern Han, conscription could be avoided if one paid a commutable tax. The Eastern Han court favored the recruitment of a volunteer army. The volunteer army comprised the Southern Army (Nanjun 南軍), while the standing army stationed in and near the capital was the Northern Army (Beijun 北軍). Led by Colonels (Xiaowei 校尉), the Northern Army consisted of five regiments, each composed of several thousand soldiers. When central authority collapsed after 189 AD, wealthy landowners, members of the aristocracy/nobility, and regional military-governors relied upon their retainers to act as their own personal troops (buqu 部曲).",Around how many soldiers were in each regiment of the Northern Army?,several thousand soldiers,0,NUM,"Around how many soldiers were in each regiment of the Northern Army?

Relevant context: In the context of the Northern Army during the American Civil War, a regiment typically consisted of approximately 1,000 soldiers when fully staffed at the beginning of a campaign. However, actual numbers varied considerably due to a range of factors, including casualties, disease, and varying rates of recruitment and replacement. 

Initially, Union Army regiments were organized according to a standard structure: each regiment was composed of ten companies, and each company was intended to have around 100 men, excluding officers. This ideal structure totaled to the aforementioned 1,000 soldiers per regiment. Nonetheless, it was common for regiments to operate at less than full strength; often, a regiment might have between 600 and 800 soldiers during campaigns.

Attrition played a significant role in reducing the number of effective soldiers in a regiment. The harsh realities of battlefield casualties, illness, and desertions frequently diminished their numbers. In many cases, regiments would be consolidated or restructured to maintain operational effectiveness. Additionally, during long campaigns or after significant battles, regiments might be replenished with new recruits or by merging with other depleted regiments, further affecting their headcounts.

This fluctuation in numbers means that while a regiment might start with around 1,000 soldiers, its effective fighting strength could be considerably lower in practice.

"Pentecostalism eventually spawned hundreds of new denominations, including large groups such as the Assemblies of God and the Church of God in Christ, both in the United States and elsewhere. There are over 279 million Pentecostals worldwide, and the movement is growing in many parts of the world, especially the global South. Since the 1960s, Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions, and Pentecostal beliefs concerning Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and Catholic churches through the Charismatic Movement. Together, Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity numbers over 500 million adherents.",How many Pentecostals are there in the world?,over 279 million,0,NUM,"How many Pentecostals are there in the world?

Relevant context: As of the most recent estimates, there are approximately 600 million Pentecostals and Charismatics worldwide, making Pentecostalism one of the fastest-growing movements within Christianity. This figure includes both persons who specifically identify as Pentecostal and those within charismatic movements across various denominations that embrace Pentecostal-style practices, such as speaking in tongues, healing, and exuberant worship.

Pentecostalism originated in the early 20th century with the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles (1906-1915), which is often considered the birth of the modern Pentecostal movement. The movement has since spread globally, particularly thriving in regions such as Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of Asia. Countries like Brazil, Nigeria, and South Korea have significant Pentecostal populations, contributing to the rapid growth of the movement.

One reason for this explosive growth is the ability of Pentecostal churches to adapt to local cultures and contexts, fostering a sense of personal connection and spiritual empowerment among followers. Pentecostalism often aligns with indigenous cultural practices and addresses social and economic issues in a way that resonates with many in the Global South.

The movement is characterized by its dynamic worship style, emphasis on the Holy Spirit's gifts, and a strong belief in personal salvation and healing. These elements attract adherents who seek a more participatory and personally meaningful religious experience.

Scholars observe that the fluid and decentralized nature of Pentecostalism allows for a wide range of beliefs and practices within the movement, which can vary significantly based on geographic and cultural contexts. Therefore, keeping precise counts can be challenging.

The two major Indo-European languages are Pali, the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism, and English. Little known fact about Myanmar is there are more than 130 languages spoken by people in Myanmar. Since many of them are known only within small tribes around the country, they may have been lost (many if not all) after a few generations.",How many different types of dictionaries could you potentially need to cover all the languages spoken in Myanmar ,there are more than 130 languages spoken by people in Myanmar,0,NUM,"How many different types of dictionaries could you potentially need to cover all the languages spoken in Myanmar 

Relevant context: Myanmar, a country rich in linguistic diversity, is home to an estimated 135 ethnic groups and over 100 languages and dialects. The official language is Burmese, spoken as a first language by the majority Bamar ethnic group and as a second language by many other ethnic groups. Consequently, the most fundamental dictionary for communication in Myanmar is a Burmese-English dictionary, which serves both native Burmese speakers and foreigners.

However, to truly cover the linguistic needs of Myanmar, several other dictionaries are required. Firstly, there are the minority languages such as Shan, Karen, Kachin, Mon, Chin, Rakhine, and others. Each of these languages could have its own bilingual dictionary, such as Shan-English, Karen-English, or Kachin-English, to facilitate understanding and cultural exchange. Given that each major ethnic group tends to have its own language, bilingual dictionaries for all these groups would be beneficial.

Furthermore, within these languages are numerous dialects. For instance, the Chin language family encompasses around 50 distinct dialects, and bi- or trilingual dictionaries considering these dialects' interactions with other Chin dialects or Burmese could be valuable.

Beyond the logistical requirements of translating all the individual languages into English or Burmese, there is a need for dictionaries that cover the more widely-spoken regional or trade languages. These often include Chinese and Hindi, as Myanmar shares borders with China and India.

Dictionary needs also extend to specialized fields such as medical, legal, or technical dictionaries in Burmese and other key languages, ensuring that professional and educational needs are met.

In a globalized world, you cannot overlook digital and online dictionaries, which provide instant translation services and linguistic resources that are constantly updated. Such resources often include audio pronunciations and translations not only for the major languages but as they're developed, for some of the minority languages as well.

In summary, to truly cover all linguistic needs in Myanmar, a combination of dictionaries is necessary: 
- Standard bilingual dictionaries for major minority languages with Burmese and English.
- Dialect-specific dictionaries to bridge the gaps between closely related dialects.
- Regional trade language dictionaries, particularly involving Chinese and Hindi.
- Specialized dictionaries for various professional fields.
- Digital resources addressing both major and minority languages.

Relevant context: The massacre of the Greeks of Ottoman descent is commonly associated with the tumultuous period of the early 20th century, specifically during the late stages of the Ottoman Empire. This tragic event is primarily linked to the Greek Genocide, which occurred during the centennial of the 1900s, a time marked by significant upheaval and change in the region.

The Greek Genocide took place over several years, beginning around 1913 and continuing through 1922, with its most intense phases during World War I and the Greco-Turkish War which followed. During this time, the Ottoman government systematically targeted Greek communities living within its borders, along with other Christian minorities such as Armenians and Assyrians.

This period saw horrific acts of violence, forced marches, deportations, and mass killings. The motivation behind these acts was largely driven by a combination of nationalism, religious intolerance, and geopolitical strategies aimed at homogenizing the region’s population to create a more cohesive Turkish state.

In historical accounts, the plight of the Ottoman Greeks is often intertwined with the broader narrative of the Ottoman Empire's decline and the emergence of the Turkish Republic. The ramifications of the massacre and the subsequent population exchanges between Greece and Turkey in 1923 contributed significantly to the demographic and cultural shifts in the region.

When completed, approximately 13% of the Barrier will be constructed on the Green Line or in Israel with 87% inside the West Bank.",When was the West Bank annexed by Jordan?,1950,0,NUM,"When was the West Bank annexed by Jordan?

Relevant context: The annexation of the West Bank by Jordan took place in 1950. Following the end of the British Mandate for Palestine and the subsequent 1948 Arab-Israeli War, a significant geopolitical shift occurred in the region. Israel declared its independence on May 14, 1948, which led to an immediate military confrontation with neighboring Arab countries, including Jordan. 

During the conflict, Jordan's Arab Legion, which was one of the best-trained and equipped forces in the region at the time, succeeded in capturing the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The area was initially placed under a form of provisional control by Jordan after the 1948 armistice agreements.

Understanding the strategic importance of the region and its historical significance, particularly in Jerusalem, Jordan moved to consolidate its hold. In April 1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank through a parliamentary act. This decision came after a unification vote, where representatives from the West Bank expressed their support for unification with Jordan in a conference held in Jericho in December 1948. Consequently, Jordan extended citizenship to the Arab residents of the West Bank, initiated governance integration, and provided services as part of the Kingdom of Jordan.

This annexation was unique because it was recognized formally only by the United Kingdom and Pakistan, while no other countries gave it official recognition. The annexation added about a third to Jordan's population and placed a substantial Palestinian minority under Jordanian rule. King Abdullah I, who had played a significant role in the war and post-war negotiations, was a driving force behind this move, seeking to enhance Jordan's standing and ensure stability. This annexation lasted until the Six-Day War in 1967, when Israel captured the West Bank.

The international community at the time reacted with varying degrees of acceptance. The Arab League initially opposed the annexation. However, clandestine political dynamics slowly shifted, leading to a de facto acceptance among several Arab states until the outbreak of hostilities again. Jordan’s annexation of the West Bank was an important chapter in the complex narrative of Middle Eastern geopolitics during the mid-20th century, impacting regional dynamics profoundly.",445.0,1975.0,2475,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.343928098678589,1.0029666423797607,6.524640321731567,1950,1.0

Relevant context: The Soviet Union, formally known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), underwent several constitutional changes throughout its existence that reflected its internal political, social, and territorial developments. One of the significant adjustments was related to the naming of one of its constituent republics: the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR).

The final iteration and inclusion of the RSFSR's name that would become established occurred during the 1977 Soviet Constitution, also known as the Brezhnev Constitution. Officially adopted on October 7, 1977, this document marked the continuation of constitutional developments that sought to unify and standardize the legal basis of the USSR's governance and the federal nature of its arrangement.

Prior to 1977, the RSFSR was indeed a part of the Soviet Union from its inception, but the names and statuses of the constituent republics were often subject to changes reflecting political dynamics. The 1977 Constitution was crucial because it reinforced the sovereignty of the republics while simultaneously emphasizing their unbreakable union under Soviet socialist governance, thus cementing the RSFSR's identity in the context of the larger Soviet framework.

The adoption of the 1977 Constitution came during an era of restructuring and reform, with the intent of addressing both international stature and domestic stability, which entwined heavily with notions of national identity and unity across the Soviet states. This alignment within the legal text was vital for solidifying the role each republic played within the collective system of the Soviet state, ensuring that their titles matched the envisioned cooperative federal structure.

"The red flag appeared as a political symbol during the French Revolution, after the fall of Bastille. A law adopted by the new government on October 20, 1789 authorized the Garde Nationale to raise the red flag in the event of a riot, to signal that the Garde would imminently intervene. During a demonstration on the Champs de Mars on July 17, 1791, the Garde Nationale fired on the crowd, killed up to fifty people. The government was denounced by the more radical revolutionaries. In the words of his famous hymn, the Marseillaise, Rouget de Lisle wrote: ""Against us they have raised the bloody flag of tyranny!"" (Contre nous de la tyrannie, l'entendard sanglant est leve). Beginning in 1790, the most radical revolutionaries adopted the red flag themselves, to symbolize the blood of those killed in the demonstrations, and to call for the repression of those they considered counter-revolutionary.",In what year did the most ardent revolutionaries in France adopt a red flag to symbolize the blood of their fallen comrades?,1790,0,NUM,"In what year did the most ardent revolutionaries in France adopt a red flag to symbolize the blood of their fallen comrades?

Relevant context: The adoption of the red flag as a symbol of revolutionary fervor in France is deeply rooted in the country's tumultuous history. The critical year when the most ardent revolutionaries embraced the red flag was 1848. This year was marked by a series of revolutionary upheavals across Europe, collectively known as the Revolutions of 1848. These uprisings sought to challenge the conservative monarchical systems and were driven by a potent mix of socio-political and economic grievances.

In France, the February Revolution of 1848 led to the abdication of King Louis-Philippe and the establishment of the Second Republic. Amidst the fervor and chaos, the red flag emerged as a poignant symbol of solidarity and sacrifice, representing the blood spilled by those who fought for liberty and rights. It was during the early months of this revolutionary period that the most dedicated, radical elements of the French revolutionary movement officially adopted the red flag, differentiating themselves from the tricolor flag, which they associated with the moderate republicans and the previous regime.

The red flag held particular resonance with the socialist factions and the working-class revolutionaries who had taken to the barricades in Paris. Many of these revolutionaries were inspired by socialist and republican ideals, and the red flag's symbolism underscored their commitment to a future defined by equality and social justice. The June Days Uprising in 1848, a workers' rebellion against the conservative closure of National Workshops, further cemented the association of the red flag with revolutionary struggle and martyrdom, as bloodshed and brutal government suppression underscored the deep divisions within the French society of the time.

Thus, the year 1848 marks the moment when the red flag became indelibly associated with the aspirations and sacrifices of France's most fervent revolutionaries, capturing the spirit of a movement striving for profound transformation.",401.0,1697.0,2168,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.451428651809692,1.0877792835235596,7.711011648178101,1790,1.0

Some clothing is permanent press, having been treated with a coating (such as polytetrafluoroethylene) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.",What does polytetrafluoroethylene suppress?,wrinkles,1,ABBR,"What does polytetrafluoroethylene suppress?

Relevant context: Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), commonly known by the brand name Teflon, is a synthetic fluoropolymer widely used for its non-stick and friction-reducing properties. One of the primary abilities of PTFE is to suppress chemical reactivity. This suppression occurs because the carbon-fluorine bonds in PTFE are extremely strong, making it resistant to interactions with other chemicals. PTFE's non-reactive nature means it does not react with most substances, which is why it is used extensively to coat kitchenware, such as frying pans, to prevent food from adhering to the surface.

In industrial contexts, PTFE is used to suppress the friction between mechanical parts. Its low coefficient of friction makes it an excellent material for gaskets, seals, and bearings, helping to reduce wear and extend the lifespan of machinery. Additionally, PTFE suppresses electrical conductivity, making it an effective insulator in electrical applications. This property is particularly useful in the aerospace and electronics industries, where reliable insulation is crucial.

PTFE also suppresses sticking and adhesion in various applications, which is why it is used to coat molds, conveyor belts, and other surfaces that need to be clean and free from materials sticking to them. Furthermore, its non-stick properties are leveraged in the medical field, where PTFE is used in catheters and other devices that need to minimize contact with biological tissues.

In summary, polytetrafluoroethylene effectively suppresses chemical reactivity, friction, electrical conductivity, and adhesion, which makes it an invaluable material across a wide range of industries. Its unique properties stem from its chemical structure, which enables it to maintain stability in harsh environments and extend the functionality of the products it is used in.",361.0,1440.0,1856,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.985138177871704,1.1793017387390137,5.326646566390991,Water absorption,0.0
"In biology, energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living organism. Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle of a biological organism. Energy is thus often said to be stored by cells in the structures of molecules of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars), lipids, and proteins, which release energy when reacted with oxygen in respiration. In human terms, the human equivalent (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500 kJ per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts, many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum. The human equivalent assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a ""feel"" for the use of a given amount of energy.",What does H-e stand for?,Human energy conversion,1,ABBR,"What does H-e stand for?

Relevant context: H-e is a term that commonly stands for ""helium,"" which is a chemical element on the periodic table with the symbol He and atomic number 2. Helium is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas that heads the noble gas series in the periodic table. In its natural state, helium is the second lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe, primarily produced through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.

Helium has several important applications due to its unique properties. It is widely used in cryogenics, particularly in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with its most well-known application perhaps being in MRI machines. Helium is also utilized in gas chromatography as a carrier gas and in the operation of weather balloons. Furthermore, it serves as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and as a coolant for nuclear reactors.

In addition to its industrial uses, helium is known for its role in scientific research and medical applications. Liquid helium, because of its extremely low boiling point near absolute zero, is critical in the study of superconductivity and superfluidity. Also, due to its inability to bond with other elements and form compounds, helium is a key component in breathing gases for deep-sea diving to prevent nitrogen narcosis.

The discovery of helium can be traced back to 1868 when it was first detected in the Sun's spectrum by French astronomer Jules Janssen and, independently, by English astronomer Joseph Norman Lockyer. Helium was later isolated on Earth in 1895 by Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay.

Whether you're considering its applications in technology, industry, or research, understanding what ""H-e"" or ""He"" stands for provides insight into its importance in a wide range of fields.",368.0,1419.0,1839,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.3997802734375,1.1224420070648193,7.61793851852417,Helium,0.0

"Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these ""omega"" long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins, which is one reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health.

Relevant context: FTP stands for ""File Transfer Protocol,"" which is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of files between a client and a server on a computer network. Originally developed during the early years of networking in the 1970s, FTP was designed to enable the efficient exchange of data across different systems. 

One of the key attributes of FTP is its ability to facilitate file sharing and transfer over the Internet. Users can upload (send) files from their local computer to a remote server or download (receive) files from a server to their personal machine. FTP operates on a client-server model, where the user interacts with an FTP client application, which in turn connects to the FTP server hosting the files.

FTP uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to ensure reliable communication and data transfer. Typically, it operates using two channels: a command channel for controlling the conversation and a data channel for transferring the actual file data. Commonly, FTP servers listen on port 21 for incoming requests from clients.

Security is an important aspect of FTP, as the original protocol was not designed with encryption in mind, meaning data (including potentially sensitive information like usernames and passwords) could be intercepted by malicious actors. To address this, secure versions of the protocol, such as FTPS (FTP Secure) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), have been developed to provide encryption and additional security features.

Overall, FTP remains a fundamental protocol used in various applications, including website maintenance, file sharing, and data backup solutions, despite the advent of more modern and secure file transfer technologies.",321.0,1206.0,1579,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.1445233821868896,2.861910820007324,7.198200225830078,File Transfer Protocol,1.0

"Almost all animals are capable of modifying their behavior as a result of experience—even the most primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Theorists dating back to Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process.",BDNF is an abbreviation for what term?,Brain-derived neurotrophic factor,1,ABBR,"BDNF is an abbreviation for what term?

Relevant context: BDNF is an abbreviation for ""Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor."" This term refers to a protein that plays a crucial role in the development, maintenance, and plasticity of neurons in the human brain and other parts of the nervous system. BDNF is part of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which are proteins involved in the survival, development, and function of neurons.

The primary role of BDNF is to support the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses, which are the connections between neurons. It is particularly active in the hippocampus, cortex, and basal forebrain—areas vital for learning, memory, and higher cognitive functions. BDNF influences brain plasticity, allowing the brain to adapt and reorganize itself in response to experiences, learning, and environmental changes.

Research indicates that BDNF levels can be affected by various factors, including physical activities like exercise, which is known to boost its levels and thus potentially enhance cognitive function and mood. Conversely, stress and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's have been associated with decreased BDNF levels, highlighting its importance in maintaining mental health and resilience to stress and age-related cognitive declines.

Understanding BDNF and its mechanisms can have significant implications for treating conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, and other neurological diseases.

"To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals – this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants. A herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants, on the other hand, contain complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose. The digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to bacteria that ferment these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type. Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals that weigh less than about 18 oz (500 g) are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of a herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (those that prey on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores). Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than 18 oz (500 g) usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves. The only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects (ants or termites).",What does a omnivore imply?,eats both prey and plants,1,ABBR,"What does a omnivore imply?

Relevant context: An omnivore is an organism that has the ability to consume and gain nutrients from a varied diet that includes both plant and animal sources. The word ""omnivore"" is derived from Latin, where ""omni"" means ""all"" or ""everything,"" and ""vorare"" means ""to eat"" or ""to devour."" This dietary classification is significant in biology and ecology because it allows omnivores to adapt to a wide range of environments and food availability. 

Typically, omnivores possess physical adaptations that enable them to process different types of food. For example, humans, who are classical omnivores, have incisors that help in biting into flesh or vegetation, and molars that are suitable for grinding plant material as well as chewing meat. Other examples of omnivorous animals include bears, raccoons, and certain bird species such as crows, which will eat fruits, seeds, insects, small animals, and carrion.

The omnivorous diet offers evolutionary advantages, such as greater dietary flexibility that can be crucial in environments where food availability can change due to seasonal shifts or other ecological factors. This flexibility allows omnivores to often occupy a central position in the food web, acting as both predators and prey and sometimes even functioning as scavengers.

In terms of nutrition, omnivores must balance the intake of various macronutrients and micronutrients to maintain health and support bodily functions. This requires a diverse diet or access to different food sources over time. In human diets, this balance is often achieved through combining plant and animal products, providing essential vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates necessary for good health.

Overall, the classification of an organism as an omnivore highlights its adaptive dietary strategies and ecological role, which can be pivotal in understanding the species' behavior, environmental interactions, and even its evolutionary development.",382.0,2036.0,2476,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,10.137192964553833,1.1240479946136475,17.864861726760864,Both carnivory and herbivory,0.8
"In 1986, a SCSI-equipped LaserDisc player attached to a BBC Master computer was used for the BBC Domesday Project. The player was referred as an LV-ROM (LaserVision Read Only Memory) as the discs contained the driving software as well as the video frames. The discs used the CAV format, and encoded data as a binary signal represented by the analog audio recording. These discs could contain in each CAV frame video/audio or video/binary data, but not both. ""Data"" frames would appear blank when played as video. It was typical for each disc to start with the disc catalog (a few blank frames) then the video introduction before the rest of the data. Because the format (based on the ADFS hard disc format) used a starting sector for each file, the data layout effectively skipped over any video frames. If all 54,000 frames are used for data storage an LV-ROM disc can contain 324 MB of data per side. The Domesday Project systems also included a genlock, allowing video frames, clips and audio to be mixed with graphics originated from the BBC Master; this was used to great effect for displaying high resolution photographs and maps, which could then be zoomed into.",What does LV-ROM stand for?,LaserVision Read Only Memory,1,ABBR,"What does LV-ROM stand for?

Relevant context: LV-ROM stands for LaserVision Read-Only Memory. This term refers to a type of optical disc storage technology which uses a laser to read digital data encoded on a disc. Unlike rewriteable formats, LV-ROMs are designed for read-only access, meaning that once data has been inscribed by the manufacturer, it cannot be modified or deleted by the user. 

LaserVision technology is primarily associated with video and data storage formats such as LaserDisc, which was one of the earliest formats for visually storing video data alongside text and graphics. The technology was first developed in the late 1970s and became widely used throughout the 1980s and 1990s for high-quality video playback. LV-ROMs were notable for their large storage capacity compared to other formats of the time, allowing for lengthy video content and large amounts of supplementary data.

While modern technology has moved towards more versatile storage formats like DVDs and Blu-ray discs, the foundational concept of using laser technology to read data remains significant.

"By the late 1990s, blue LEDs became widely available. They have an active region consisting of one or more InGaN quantum wells sandwiched between thicker layers of GaN, called cladding layers. By varying the relative In/Ga fraction in the InGaN quantum wells, the light emission can in theory be varied from violet to amber. Aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN) of varying Al/Ga fraction can be used to manufacture the cladding and quantum well layers for ultraviolet LEDs, but these devices have not yet reached the level of efficiency and technological maturity of InGaN/GaN blue/green devices. If un-alloyed GaN is used in this case to form the active quantum well layers, the device will emit near-ultraviolet light with a peak wavelength centred around 365 nm. Green LEDs manufactured from the InGaN/GaN system are far more efficient and brighter than green LEDs produced with non-nitride material systems, but practical devices still exhibit efficiency too low for high-brightness applications.[citation needed]",What does AlGaN stand for?,Aluminium gallium nitride,1,ABBR,"What does AlGaN stand for?

Relevant context: AlGaN stands for Aluminum Gallium Nitride, which is a semiconductor material used primarily in the production of electronic and optoelectronic devices.

"Because the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar n–p–n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent p–n–p transistor. GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors. It is for this reason that GaAs is used in high-frequency applications. A relatively recent FET development, the high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT), has a heterostructure (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)-gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 GHz. HEMTs based on gallium nitride and aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN HEMTs) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications.",What does HEMT stand for?,high-electron-mobility transistor,1,ABBR,"What does HEMT stand for?

Relevant context: HEMT stands for High Electron Mobility Transistor, a type of field-effect transistor that utilizes a junction between two materials with different band gaps, typically involving semiconductors. This technology is crucial for applications that require high-speed and high-frequency operation, such as in microwave and millimeter-wave electronics, satellite communications, radar systems, and more recently, high-speed wireless communications.

HEMTs derive their unique characteristics from the use of materials like Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) or Indium Phosphide (InP), which enable high electron mobility due to reduced scattering. The underlying principle of a HEMT is the creation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the heterojunction interface. This 2DEG allows for electrons to move freely without much resistance, substantially boosting the transistor's speed and efficiency.

Developed in the 1970s and 1980s, HEMTs were first used to enhance the performance of microwave communications. They operate on the principle of modulation of conductivity in a thin layer of semiconductor where highly mobile electrons accumulate. In practice, this means that HEMTs exhibit faster switching speeds and lower noise levels compared to conventional MOSFETs, making them invaluable in advanced communication systems.

The performance of HEMTs can vary based on the materials used; for example, AlGaAs/GaAs HEMTs are known for their high frequency capabilities, whereas InAlAs/InGaAs HEMTs may offer better performance in terms of frequency and power at higher frequencies.

"The cloth or fiber material used, resin material, and the cloth to resin ratio determine the laminate's type designation (FR-4, CEM-1, G-10, etc.) and therefore the characteristics of the laminate produced. Important characteristics are the level to which the laminate is fire retardant, the dielectric constant (er), the loss factor (tδ), the tensile strength, the shear strength, the glass transition temperature (Tg), and the Z-axis expansion coefficient (how much the thickness changes with temperature).",What's the abbreviation for the glass transition temperature of a laminate?,Tg,1,ABBR,"What's the abbreviation for the glass transition temperature of a laminate?

Relevant context: In the field of materials science, particularly when discussing polymers and laminates, the glass transition temperature is a crucial property. For laminates, which are often composites made up of layered materials, understanding this temperature is key to predicting their behavior in different environmental conditions. The glass transition temperature is the point at which a material such as a laminate transitions from a hard and relatively brittle state into a softer and more pliable one. This transformation occurs because the polymer chains in the laminate begin to move more freely as they gain thermal energy.

The abbreviation for the glass transition temperature is universally represented as \( T_g \). This notation is standard across various scientific disciplines involving polymers, composites, and laminates. \( T_g \) is an important parameter for manufacturers and engineers because it directly influences the material's mechanical properties, such as stiffness and thermal stability. For example, if a laminate is used for structural applications, it is essential for the \( T_g \) to be higher than the maximum operating temperature to maintain structural integrity. In the context of electronics, where laminates are used as substrates or insulators, knowing the \( T_g \) helps ensure that the materials do not deform or fail under thermal stress.

Therefore, when researching materials for specific applications, especially those involving varying temperatures, the \( T_g \) is a critical factor that can affect performance, durability, and safety. Scientists and engineers often rely on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to accurately measure \( T_g \), ensuring that the laminate will perform optimally in its intended operational environment.",328.0,1403.0,1788,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.7983336448669434,0.988224983215332,4.768411159515381,Tg,1.0

Relevant context: DRM stands for Digital Rights Management. It refers to a set of access control technologies used by manufacturers, publishers, and copyright holders to regulate how digital content is used and distributed. DRM is commonly applied to software, e-books, films, music, and other forms of digital media to prevent unauthorized copying, sharing, and piracy. 

The primary goal of DRM is to protect intellectual property by allowing content creators to specify conditions under which their digital works can be accessed or modified. This can include limiting the number of devices on which media can be played, restricting print capabilities, or setting expiration dates for access to certain content.

One widely recognized example of DRM use is the protection of e-books purchased from platforms like Amazon's Kindle store, where users can read books on Kindle devices or apps but cannot freely share the files with others. Similarly, streaming services like Netflix and Spotify implement DRM systems to ensure that only subscribers can access their vast libraries of media content.

While DRM is designed to safeguard the rights of content creators, it is also the subject of controversy and criticism. Critics argue that DRM can inconvenience legitimate consumers by imposing overly restrictive and complex usage limitations, and sometimes view it as infringing on consumer rights, such as the right to ""fair use."" Additionally, the effectiveness of DRM is frequently questioned, as determined individuals can often find ways to bypass these technologies.

In essence, DRM represents a crucial, though often contentious, tool in the digital economy that balances the rights of creators with consumer access to media. As digital content continues to expand, the role and impact of DRM will likely evolve and remain a relevant topic for discussion in the technology and media industries.",338.0,1462.0,1852,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.271528244018555,1.7075092792510986,12.67095685005188,Digital Rights Management,1.0
"The two neurotransmitters that are used most widely in the vertebrate brain are glutamate, which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is almost always inhibitory. Neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain. Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.",GABA is the abbreviation for what?,gamma-aminobutyric acid,1,ABBR,"GABA is the abbreviation for what?

Relevant context: GABA is the abbreviation for Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the central nervous system. It is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, meaning it helps to reduce neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system. By attaching to its receptors, GABA works to calm the nervous system and is essential for maintaining balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. This balancing act is vital for normal brain function and for preventing over-excitability that can lead to disorders such as epilepsy.

GABA is synthesized in the brain from glutamate, another key neurotransmitter, through the action of the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) with the help of vitamin B6. Notably, GABA functions to regulate anxiety, muscle tension, and sleep cycles, which is why GABAergic drugs like benzodiazepines are often used clinically as anxiolytics, muscle relaxants, and anticonvulsants.

Relevant context: ALS stands for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, which is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The term ""amyotrophic"" comes from the Greek language and means ""no muscle nourishment,"" reflecting the muscle wasting and weakness that occur as the disease progresses. ""Lateral"" refers to the areas in the spinal cord where the nerve cells that signal and control the muscles are located, and ""sclerosis"" means scarring or hardening, which occurs as the disease advances and the affected nerve cells degenerate.

ALS is known for causing the gradual loss of voluntary muscle action, leading to various symptoms, including difficulty speaking, swallowing, and eventually breathing. It's primarily known for its impact on motor neurons, which are responsible for sending signals from the brain to the muscles to activate them. As these neurons deteriorate, their signals to the muscles are reduced, leading to muscle atrophy.

The exact cause of ALS is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. About 5-10% of cases are inherited as familial ALS, which is linked to genetic mutations, while the remaining cases are sporadic with no clear genetic cause.

Currently, there is no cure for ALS, but there are treatments that can help manage symptoms and support patients' quality of life. These may include physical therapy, respiratory care, and medications like riluzole and edaravone, which have been shown to slow disease progression in some individuals.

ALS gained widespread public attention due to the Ice Bucket Challenge, a viral social media campaign that raised significant funds and awareness for ALS research.

However, there are ecological and demographic constraints on extra pair matings. Nevertheless, 43% of broods produced by incestuously paired females contained extra pair young.",What can reduce the negative effects of inbreeding?,Females paired with related males may undertake extra pair matings,1,DESC,"What can reduce the negative effects of inbreeding?

Relevant context: The negative effects of inbreeding, known as inbreeding depression, can be mitigated through several strategic approaches. Inbreeding increases the likelihood of genetic disorders and reduced fitness due to the higher probability of offspring inheriting harmful recessive alleles. To counteract these effects, the introduction of genetic diversity is crucial.

One effective method to reduce inbreeding depression is outcrossing, or introducing unrelated individuals into a breeding population. This process helps restore genetic variation and can lead to heterosis, or hybrid vigor, wherein the offspring show improved biological functions compared to their parents. For example, in animal breeding programs, introducing wild individuals into a domesticated population can revitalize genetic pools and enhance traits such as disease resistance and fertility.

Another approach is the implementation of a structured breeding program that actively monitors and manages genetic diversity. This may involve maintaining detailed pedigree records to track genetic relationships and make informed decisions to avoid mating closely related individuals. Genetic testing and analysis play a vital role in these programs by identifying potentially harmful alleles and advising on breeding combinations that minimize genetic risks.

In conservation biology, managed relocation or the translocation of individuals between fragmented habitats can help increase gene flow and reduce the risk of inbreeding in isolated populations. Such interventions need to be carefully planned to consider ecological compatibility and prevent the disruption of local ecosystems.

Population size also influences the degree of inbreeding. Larger populations naturally tend to have greater genetic diversity. Therefore, conservation efforts often focus on boosting population numbers and ensuring a stable and viable population size to mitigate inbreeding effects over the long term.

Finally, education and community involvement are crucial for the success of any genetic management strategy. Educating stakeholders about the risks of inbreeding and the benefits of genetic diversity can foster support for breeding and conservation programs aimed at reducing inbreeding depression.

In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace."" Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: ""Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm."" He further stated: ""One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity."" The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.",What writing of Chopin talks about everything about piano playing has to do with proper fingering?,his Projet de méthode,1,DESC,"What writing of Chopin talks about everything about piano playing has to do with proper fingering?

Relevant context: While Frédéric Chopin did not leave behind an extensive body of written work explicitly dedicated to piano pedagogy, his thoughts on piano playing and, in particular, on fingering can be gleaned from his teaching notes and anecdotal accounts from his students, notably found in works such as the ""Etudes"" and through his students' writings. A critical source that encapsulates his approach to fingering is his ""Études,"" Op. 10 and Op. 25, where Chopin's innovative fingerings are not only technically demanding but are crucial for achieving the expressive nuances he intended.

Chopin believed that proper fingering was vital for achieving the fluidity and expressiveness central to his musical style. In these studies, the choice of fingering goes beyond technical execution; it is a deliberate tool for achieving musical phrasing and dynamics. Chopin often encouraged his students to explore different fingerings, emphasizing that flexibility and comfort should guide their choices. He was known for his innovative approach, sometimes deviating from conventional fingering to accommodate his hand positions, which often resulted in smoother transitions and a more seamless legato.

In accounts from his students, such as Émile Gaillard and Wilhelm von Lenz, Chopin emphasized that proper fingering allowed the pianist to 'sing' on the piano, treating the instrument less mechanically and more vocally. He instructed his pupils to use fingering as a means of shaping each note and phrase, thus insisting that technical precision was intertwined with artistic interpretation.

The importance Chopin placed on fingering is mirrored in the meticulous fingerings painstakingly marked in his piano works, serving both as a technical guide and a means to uncover the interpretative possibilities within each piece. This dual focus highlights his belief that every technical aspect of playing, particularly fingering, was fundamental to the expressiveness and overall performance of a piece. While Chopin may not have authored a singular treatise discussing fingering in isolation, the depth of his insights is richly embedded in his compositions and the teachings passed down through his students.",432.0,1832.0,2329,1.0,1.0,1.0,19.14469051361084,1.1043369770050049,21.19552206993103,Projet de méthode,0.9
"A bantam is a small variety of domestic chicken, either a miniature version of a member of a standard breed, or a ""true bantam"" with no larger counterpart. The name derives from the town of Bantam in Java where European sailors bought the local small chickens for their shipboard supplies. Bantams may be a quarter to a third of the size of standard birds and lay similarly small eggs. They are kept by small-holders and hobbyists for egg production, use as broody hens, ornamental purposes, and showing.",Do bantams lay regular sized eggs ?,Bantams may be a quarter to a third of the size of standard birds and lay similarly small eggs,1,DESC,"Do bantams lay regular sized eggs ?

Relevant context: Bantam chickens, often prized for their compact size and ornamental appearance, differ from standard chickens not only in stature but also in the eggs they produce. One of the most frequent questions about bantams is whether they lay regular-sized eggs. To clarify, bantams typically lay eggs that are smaller than the average egg from standard-sized chickens. 

While a standard chicken egg usually weighs between 55 to 70 grams, bantam eggs generally weigh between 30 to 40 grams. These smaller eggs still have a similar yolk-to-white ratio, making them equally nutritious, though you might need two or three bantam eggs to equal the volume of one large chicken egg.

Bantams come in many breeds, and egg size can vary slightly among them. For instance, the Silkie bantam may lay particularly small eggs due to its petite size, while a larger bantam, such as the Bantam Orpington, might produce eggs that are slightly larger, though still not reaching the size of standard chicken eggs.

While the bantam's smaller eggs may not be ideal for those requiring larger quantities for baking or cooking, they are perfect for those who appreciate smaller portions or seek an egg with a distinct flavor and culinary versatility. Thus, while bantams do not lay regular-sized eggs, their eggs are cherished by many for their unique characteristics.",280.0,1639.0,1971,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.706401824951172,1.2280380725860596,4.8644118309021,No,0.0
"According to the American National Standards Institute, pitch is the auditory attribute of sound according to which sounds can be ordered on a scale from low to high. Since pitch is such a close proxy for frequency, it is almost entirely determined by how quickly the sound wave is making the air vibrate and has almost nothing to do with the intensity, or amplitude, of the wave. That is, ""high"" pitch means very rapid oscillation, and ""low"" pitch corresponds to slower oscillation. Despite that, the idiom relating vertical height to sound pitch is shared by most languages. At least in English, it is just one of many deep conceptual metaphors that involve up/down. The exact etymological history of the musical sense of high and low pitch is still unclear. There is evidence that humans do actually perceive that the source of a sound is slightly higher or lower in vertical space when the sound frequency is increased or decreased.",Pitch is a close proxy for what?,frequency,1,DESC,"Pitch is a close proxy for what?

Relevant context: Pitch is a close proxy for musical frequency, as it relates to how we perceive the frequency of sound waves. In the realm of music and acoustics, pitch represents the perceived highness or lowness of a sound. This perception correlates closely with the frequency of the sound wave, typically measured in hertz (Hz). When you hear a note played on a musical instrument, the pitch you perceive is directly tied to the frequency of the sound wave produced.

For example, the musical note ""A4,"" commonly used as a tuning standard, is typically associated with a frequency of 440 Hz. Thus, when a musician refers to the pitch of a note, they are essentially referring to the frequency that corresponds to that note. Moreover, scientific studies have established that our auditory system interprets these frequencies in a logarithmic manner. This means that the interval between notes, such as an octave, involves doubling the frequency (e.g., A4 at 440 Hz and A5 at 880 Hz).

In addition to serving as a proxy for frequency, pitch is a foundational concept in music theory, as it defines melodies and harmonies, organizing them into scales and chords. The relationship between pitch and frequency is innate to various cultures' musical systems, despite variations in tuning and scale construction.

Importantly, while pitch is closely related to frequency, it is a perceptual phenomenon that can be influenced by other factors such as the sound wave’s timbre and loudness. Hence, two instruments playing the same note at the same frequency can be perceived as having slightly different pitches, due to the unique timbres of each instrument. Psychoacoustics, the study of the psychological and physiological responses to sound, delves into these nuances to understand how humans perceive pitch and why it might differ slightly from the actual measured frequency in some contexts.

Understanding pitch as a proxy for frequency not only aids in musical comprehension but also finds application in fields such as acoustics, audio engineering, and even speech analysis, where pitch information can be used to infer information about a speaker’s emotional state or gender. Thus, recognizing that pitch serves as a reliable stand-in for frequency provides clarity across multiple disciplines, enhancing the analysis of sound in both practical and theoretical contexts.",460.0,1723.0,2235,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,5.2127845287323,1.0314617156982422,7.307790756225586,Frequency,1.0
"Stressful life experiences may be a cause of memory loss as a person ages. Glucocorticoids that are released during stress damage neurons that are located in the hippocampal region of the brain. Therefore, the more stressful situations that someone encounters, the more susceptible they are to memory loss later on. The CA1 neurons found in the hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing the release of glucose and the reuptake of glutamate. This high level of extracellular glutamate allow calcium to enter NMDA receptors which in return kills neurons. Stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind. This directly relates to traumatic events in one's past such as kidnappings, being prisoners of war or sexual abuse as a child.",What will a person often do with extremely stressful memories?,repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind,1,DESC,"What will a person often do with extremely stressful memories?

Relevant context: When a person experiences extremely stressful or traumatic memories, they may employ a variety of coping mechanisms to manage the emotional and psychological impact. One common response is suppression, where the individual consciously attempts to push the distressing memory out of their awareness to avoid the associated negative emotions. Over time, this can lead to repression, a more unconscious process where the mind obscures the memory to protect the individual from distress. 

Additionally, individuals might engage in rumination, where they continuously think about the stressful event, often replaying it in their minds and feeling stuck in a cycle of negative emotions. This can lead to further stress and exacerbate problems like anxiety and depression.

Another coping mechanism is emotional avoidance, where a person actively avoids situations, people, or discussions that might trigger remembrance of the traumatic event. For example, a person who has experienced a car accident might avoid driving or even being a passenger in a vehicle.

Some individuals might seek distraction through activities such as exercise, consuming media, or social interactions to take their minds off the distressing memories. In more severe cases, people may turn to substance abuse as a way to numb emotional pain or block unwelcome memories.

In contrast, some people may process their experience through therapeutic means. This can include talking to a mental health professional, engaging in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or using techniques such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). These therapeutic approaches help individuals face and integrate the memory in a controlled and supportive environment, ultimately leading to healing.

Finally, some individuals may try to find meaning in their experience, reframing the memory in a way that contributes to personal growth or resilience. This is often seen as a feature of post-traumatic growth.

Thus, people handle stressful memories through a complex interplay of avoidance, processing, emotional and behavioral strategies, and sometimes finding growth opportunities. Understanding these coping mechanisms can help individuals and professionals address the impacts of such memories constructively.",407.0,1718.0,2181,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.470444679260254,0.9512877464294434,5.512601852416992,Repression,0.8
"Greek cuisine is characteristic of the healthy Mediterranean diet, which is epitomized by dishes of Crete. Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients into a variety of local dishes such as moussaka, stifado, Greek salad, fasolada, spanakopita and souvlaki. Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece like skordalia (a thick purée of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), lentil soup, retsina (white or rosé wine sealed with pine resin) and pasteli (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as meze with various dips such as tzatziki, grilled octopus and small fish, feta cheese, dolmades (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various pulses, olives and cheese. Olive oil is added to almost every dish.",What is a characteristic of the Mediterranean diet? ,Greek cuisine,1,DESC,"What is a characteristic of the Mediterranean diet? 

Relevant context: The Mediterranean diet is renowned for its emphasis on plant-based foods, making it one of the healthiest eating patterns globally. A characteristic feature of this diet is its abundant inclusion of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. These foods are rich in essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, contributing to overall health and well-being. Additionally, the diet prioritizes healthy fats, particularly olive oil, as the primary source of dietary fat. Olive oil is a monounsaturated fat, known for its beneficial effects on heart health, including reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. 

Moreover, the Mediterranean diet includes moderate consumption of fish and poultry, which provide important sources of protein and omega-3 fatty acids. Red meat and dairy products are consumed less frequently and in smaller portions. The diet also incorporates herbs and spices instead of salt to flavor foods, thus reducing sodium intake. Another distinctive aspect of this eating style is the sociocultural component, which emphasizes communal eating, regular physical activity, and mindful eating practices.

Overall, the Mediterranean diet is not just about specific foods but also about an approach to meals and lifestyle that promotes long-term health benefits.

"Sound could be stored in either analog or digital format and in a variety of surround sound formats; NTSC discs could carry two analog audio tracks, plus two uncompressed PCM digital audio tracks, which were (EFM, CIRC, 16-bit and 44.056 kHz sample rate). PAL discs could carry one pair of audio tracks, either analog or digital and the digital tracks on a PAL disc were 16-bit 44.1 kHz as on a CD; in the UK, the term ""LaserVision"" is used to refer to discs with analog sound, while ""LaserDisc"" is used for those with digital audio. The digital sound signal in both formats are EFM-encoded as in CD. Dolby Digital (also called AC-3) and DTS—which are now common on DVD titles—first became available on LaserDisc, and Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) which was released on LaserDisc in Japan, is among the first home video releases ever to include 6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround. Unlike DVDs, which carry Dolby Digital audio in digital form, LaserDiscs store Dolby Digital in a frequency modulated form within a track normally used for analog audio. Extracting Dolby Digital from a LaserDisc required a player equipped with a special ""AC-3 RF"" output and an external demodulator in addition to an AC-3 decoder. The demodulator was necessary to convert the 2.88 MHz modulated AC-3 information on the disc into a 384 kbit/s signal that the decoder could handle. DTS audio, when available on a disc, replaced the digital audio tracks; hearing DTS sound required only an S/PDIF compliant digital connection to a DTS decoder.",What sound formatting do DVDs use?,Dolby Digital audio in digital form,1,DESC,"What sound formatting do DVDs use?

Relevant context: DVDs, or Digital Versatile Discs, employ several sound formatting techniques to deliver high-quality audio to the viewer. The most prevalent audio format found on DVDs is Dolby Digital, also known as AC-3. This format is widely used because it supports up to six discrete channels of audio, offering a 5.1 surround sound experience. In a 5.1 configuration, audio is divided among five full-bandwidth channels (Front Left, Front Center, Front Right, Surround Left, and Surround Right) and one low-frequency effects channel (the .1, often referred to as the subwoofer channel).

Dolby Digital files typically offer audio at a bitrate ranging from 384 to 448 kilobits per second (kbps), which strikes a balance between audio clarity and efficient data storage. Some DVDs may also utilize higher-quality audio formats like the DTS (Digital Theater Systems) format, which can offer bitrates up to 1.5 megabits per second (Mbps) for an enhanced surround sound experience, though it requires more storage space on the disc.

In addition to these formats, DVDs may include uncompressed audio tracks in the Linear PCM (Pulse-Code Modulation) format. Linear PCM audio is typically used for straightforward, two-channel stereo sound or high-fidelity, multichannel audio but requires significantly more disk space compared to compressed formats like Dolby Digital and DTS.

Some DVDs also offer multiple audio tracks to cater to international audiences, often including several language options, which may be presented in stereo or surround sound formats. This versatility in sound formatting is a defining feature of the DVD format and has contributed to its sustained popularity in the home entertainment market by providing a rich auditory experience tailored to various sound systems and viewer preferences.

"One of the most spectacular examples of obligate mutualism is between the siboglinid tube worms and symbiotic bacteria that live at hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. The worm has no digestive tract and is wholly reliant on its internal symbionts for nutrition. The bacteria oxidize either hydrogen sulfide or methane, which the host supplies to them. These worms were discovered in the late 1980s at the hydrothermal vents near the Galapagos Islands and have since been found at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps in all of the world's oceans.",What does the bacteria give the worm?,nutrition,1,DESC,"What does the bacteria give the worm?

Relevant context: In certain symbiotic relationships between bacteria and worms, the bacteria play a crucial role in providing essential nutrients and other benefits to their worm hosts. One well-known example of such a relationship is the association between chemosynthetic bacteria and tubeworms found in deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments. 

In these extreme habitats, tubeworms lack digestive systems and instead rely entirely on their symbiotic bacteria for nutrition. The bacteria reside within a specialized organ in the worm called the trophosome. Here, the bacteria oxidize hydrogen sulfide, which is abundant in the environment around hydrothermal vents, to produce organic compounds through a process known as chemosynthesis. These organic compounds serve as the primary source of nourishment for the worm, essentially functioning analogously to how plants use photosynthesis to produce food.

Additionally, this bacterial process provides the worm with essential amino acids and other nutrients that contribute to its growth and survival in a habitat where other food sources are scarce or non-existent. By converting inorganic hydrogen sulfide into organic matter, these bacteria enable tubeworms to thrive in the nutrient-poor deep-sea conditions.

This symbiotic relationship illustrates a fascinating exchange where the bacteria give the worm the nutritional sustenance it needs, while the worm, in return, offers a protected environment with a steady supply of raw materials necessary for bacterial chemosynthesis. This interdependence highlights a remarkable adaptation to the extreme environment of the deep sea, enabling the survival of both organisms.",306.0,1426.0,1785,1.0,1.0,1.0,62.65642833709717,1.046529769897461,64.69955468177795,Organic matter,0.0
"The brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glial cells. Glial cells (also known as glia or neuroglia) come in several types, and perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development. Neurons, however, are usually considered the most important cells in the brain. The property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals by means of an axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.",What is the typical speed that axons send their electrical signals?,1–100 meters per second,1,DESC,"What is the typical speed that axons send their electrical signals?

Relevant context: Axons, the long, slender projections of nerve cells, are essential for transmitting electrical signals between neurons and from neurons to muscles or glands. The speed at which these signals, or action potentials, travel can vary considerably depending on several factors, including the type of neuron, the presence of myelin, and axon diameter.

In general, the speed at which axons conduct electrical impulses can range from about 1 meter per second (m/s) to over 100 meters per second. This range reflects the diversity in axon types and structures across different parts of the nervous system. 

One crucial determinant of conduction speed is myelination. Myelinated axons, which are wrapped in layers of a fatty substance called myelin, conduct signals much faster than unmyelinated ones. This is due to the saltatory conduction mechanism, where electrical impulses ""jump"" from one node of Ranvier (gaps in the myelin sheath) to the next, greatly increasing signal propagation velocity. Myelinated axons can achieve speeds between 10 and 120 m/s, with larger-diameter fibers within peripheral nervous systems typically at the higher end of this range.

In contrast, unmyelinated axons generally conduct signals more slowly, usually between 0.5 to 2 m/s. Smaller diameter and lack of myelin lead to a continuous propagation of the action potential, which inherently takes longer.

Moreover, axon diameter contributes to conduction speed. Larger axon diameters result in faster signal transmission due to lower resistance to the flow of ions within the axon, enhancing the efficiency of electrical signal propagation.

These variations in conduction speed are crucial for the body's functioning, allowing for rapid responses in some systems, such as reflex actions, while permitting slower, more modulated responses in others, like those involved in proprioception or internal organ regulation. Overall, the typical speed at which axons send their electrical signals depends heavily on their structural characteristics and the specific physiological demands they need to meet.",418.0,1565.0,2045,1.0,1.0,1.0,14.188867807388306,0.9893543720245361,16.190098762512207,1–100 meters per second,1.0
"While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks. The principal benefits of flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency. Defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. This has led to the development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources. Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.",What is a cost of flocking?,bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds,1,DESC,"What is a cost of flocking?

Relevant context: Flocking behavior is a fascinating phenomenon observed across various species, notably in birds, where individuals move together in a coordinated manner. While flocking provides several benefits, such as enhanced foraging success and improved predator avoidance, it also comes with its own set of costs.

One significant cost of flocking is the increase in competition for resources. As individuals gather in large groups, there is greater competition for food, water, and other vital resources. This can lead to diminished access to these resources for individual members and can be particularly challenging when resources are scarce.

Another cost associated with flocking is the increased risk of disease transmission. In closely packed groups, parasites and pathogens can spread more easily from one individual to another. This environment can facilitate the rapid transmission of diseases that could potentially decimate large portions of the flock.

Additionally, flocking can attract predators. While collective movement can confuse predators and provide safety in numbers, large congregations of animals are more conspicuous and can attract more attention. Predators may target the edges of flocks, where individuals may be more vulnerable, or take advantage of the chaos that sometimes ensues in dense, moving groups.

Finally, flocking can impose energetic costs. Maintaining formation and synchronizing movement with other group members can require significant energy expenditure. Individuals must constantly adjust their flight paths or locomotion to keep pace with others, which can be tiring and might detract from other vital activities such as feeding or resting.

In conclusion, while flocking confers various advantages, the costs—such as resource competition, disease spread, attraction of predators, and energy expenditure—are crucial considerations that influence the behavior and survival of flocking species. Understanding these trade-offs helps ecologists and biologists explore how and why flocking behavior has evolved and persists in certain species.",369.0,1488.0,1915,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.23222017288208,1.0154931545257568,5.3359458446502686,Bullying of socially subordinate birds.,0.8
"Active solar techniques use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, solar thermal collectors, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.",What does a passive solar technique do?,reduce the need for alternate resources,1,DESC,"What does a passive solar technique do?

Relevant context: A passive solar technique is a method used in building design to harness and optimize the use of natural sunlight for heating and lighting a space, without relying on mechanical systems. The key principle of passive solar design is to maximize the absorption and retention of heat from the sun, while minimizing heat loss. This involves strategic architectural and design choices that work with the environment's natural energy flows.

One of the primary techniques involves the orientation and layout of a building. By positioning a structure so that its longest wall faces true south (in the Northern Hemisphere), the building can absorb the maximum amount of solar radiation during the winter months when the sun is lower in the sky. Large, south-facing windows allow sunlight to penetrate deep into the building, providing natural light and warmth.

Thermal mass is another critical element of passive solar design. Materials with high thermal mass, such as brick, concrete, and stone, are used within the building to absorb and store heat from the sun during the day and gradually release it at night when temperatures drop. This natural regulation of temperature reduces the need for artificial heating and cooling, enhancing energy efficiency.

Passive solar techniques also include the use of shading devices, such as overhangs or adjustable louvers, which block excessive summer sun while allowing winter sunlight to enter. This reduces overheating in the warmer months and promotes energy savings year-round.

Insulation and airtight construction are crucial components that ensure minimal heat loss, thereby maintaining comfortable indoor temperatures with the least amount of energy consumption. Passive solar design can also be complemented by other sustainable practices, such as integrating photovoltaic panels and using energy-efficient appliances, to maximize the overall environmental benefit.

Relevant context: In western North Carolina, the preferred cut of pork for barbecue is typically the pork shoulder, specifically the Boston butt, which is the upper portion of the shoulder. This cut is favored due to its balance of meat and fat, contributing to a tender, juicy final product after slow cooking. 

Western North Carolina barbecue is celebrated for its distinctive style, which involves smoking the pork over wood, often hardwoods like hickory, oak, or a blend of both. The Boston butt cut is particularly suited for this method because it retains moisture and flavor throughout the long smoking process, which can take anywhere from 8 to 12 hours, depending on the size of the meat and the temperature used.

Once the pork shoulder is cooked to perfection, it is traditionally chopped or pulled into shreds. The resulting barbecue is typically served with a thin, tangy vinegar-based sauce, mildly sweetened and spiced with ingredients like ketchup, red pepper flakes, and other seasonings. This style of sauce is characteristic of western North Carolina cuisine and provides a complementary tartness that cuts through the richness of the smoked pork.

Accompaniments often include coleslaw, hush puppies, and other regional favorites.

Security is another significant aspect that sets Windows Store apps apart. These apps are distributed through the Microsoft Store, which ensures that they are sandboxed. The sandbox environment isolates apps from the rest of the system, reducing the risk of malware and unintentional damage to the device or user data. This approach enhances security and provides users with more confidence in the apps they download.

Windows Store apps follow a specific design language known as Fluent Design, which emphasizes clean, bold, and responsive user interfaces. This design philosophy ensures a consistent look and feel across all Windows apps, making them intuitive for users to navigate.

Moreover, Windows Store apps benefit from always-up-to-date features. Updates are automatically handled through the Microsoft Store, ensuring users always have the latest version of an app with new features and security improvements without requiring manual intervention.

Additionally, UWP apps have access to a wide array of Windows’ platform capabilities, such as Cortana integration, Live Tiles, push notifications, and the usage of Microsoft’s cloud services like Azure. This integration allows developers to exploit Windows’ native features, providing enriched and context-aware experiences in their apps.

In summary, the uniqueness of Windows Store apps lies in their cross-device compatibility, secure distribution model, consistent and modern design language, automatic updates, and deep integration with Windows platform features. These factors make them an appealing choice for both developers and users, seeking efficiency and reliability across the Windows ecosystem.",436.0,1757.0,2246,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,8.649965763092041,2.1555304527282715,11.938313961029053,Sandboxed environment,0.0
"The MP3 lossy audio data compression algorithm takes advantage of a perceptual limitation of human hearing called auditory masking. In 1894, the American physicist Alfred M. Mayer reported that a tone could be rendered inaudible by another tone of lower frequency. In 1959, Richard Ehmer described a complete set of auditory curves regarding this phenomenon. Ernst Terhardt et al. created an algorithm describing auditory masking with high accuracy. This work added to a variety of reports from authors dating back to Fletcher, and to the work that initially determined critical ratios and critical bandwidths.",What does the MP3 compression take advantage of?,perceptual limitation,1,DESC,"What does the MP3 compression take advantage of?

Relevant context: The MP3 compression algorithm, which stands for MPEG-1 Audio Layer III, primarily takes advantage of the way humans perceive sound, a concept known as auditory masking. This principle is part of a broader field known as perceptual coding.

One of the key insights used in MP3 compression is that the human ear does not perceive all audio frequencies equally. For instance, when two sounds with similar frequencies occur simultaneously, the louder one tends to mask the quieter one. As a result, the quieter, masked sound can be reduced or even eliminated without a noticeable loss in audio quality. This allows MP3 compression to significantly reduce the amount of data required to represent audio by discarding sounds that are less likely to be heard by the human ear.

Additionally, MP3 compression capitalizes on the limitations of human hearing by focusing on the frequencies that we can hear most distinctly. The human ear is most sensitive to frequencies between 2 kHz and 5 kHz. Frequencies outside this range can be downsampled more aggressively, leading to further data savings without a significant impact on perceived sound quality.

The algorithm also uses a technique called temporal masking, where louder sounds can mask quieter sounds that occur immediately before or after them. By strategically leveraging temporal masking, MP3 can reduce finer details in audio data that would be imperceptible due to the masking effect, again leading to data reduction.

To achieve compression, the MP3 algorithm divides the audio signal into small timeframes, applies a Fourier transform to analyze frequency contents, and uses psychoacoustic models to determine which parts of the audio can be discarded or quantitatively reduced. MP3 compression also uses Huffman coding, a lossless data compression method, to further reduce the size of the audio file by efficiently encoding the remaining data.

This combination of leveraging psychoacoustic models, perceptual auditory masking, and efficient encoding strategies allows MP3 to significantly compress audio files while maintaining a quality level that is generally acceptable for casual listening, making it a popular choice for digital music distribution.",417.0,1295.0,1768,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.624014854431152,1.0717277526855469,7.919671058654785,Auditory masking,0.5
"Database storage is the container of the physical materialization of a database. It comprises the internal (physical) level in the database architecture. It also contains all the information needed (e.g., metadata, ""data about the data"", and internal data structures) to reconstruct the conceptual level and external level from the internal level when needed. Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the database engine a.k.a. ""storage engine"". Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often utilizing the operating systems' file systems as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration setting are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators. A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look in the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database).",What is responsible for putting information into permanent storage?,database engine,1,DESC,"What is responsible for putting information into permanent storage?

Relevant context: When discussing what is responsible for putting information into permanent storage, it is important to understand the roles of several key components in computing and data management.

At the hardware level, permanent storage is typically managed by devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and optical discs like CDs and DVDs. These devices store data even when the power is turned off, unlike volatile memory such as RAM (Random Access Memory), which temporarily holds data being actively used or processed by the computer.

Hard disk drives store data magnetically on spinning disks, while solid-state drives use flash memory to store data electronically. SSDs have become popular due to their speed and durability compared to traditional HDDs, which rely on moving parts.

From a software perspective, operating systems and file systems play crucial roles in managing how information is written to and retrieved from these permanent storage devices. A file system organizes data into files and directories, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information. Common file systems include NTFS, used by Windows, and ext4, commonly used by Linux systems.

Additionally, databases serve as another critical layer for storing information permanently. Database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL are responsible for inserting, updating, and deleting data in a structured manner, ensuring data integrity and facilitating easy access and querying.

In networked environments, cloud storage solutions, such as those provided by Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Storage, offer scalable and resilient options for permanent data storage. These services employ distributed storage infrastructure and redundancy to ensure data remains accessible and protected against physical hardware failures.

Thus, the responsibility for placing information into permanent storage is a collaborative effort between hardware components, operating systems, file systems, database management systems, and sometimes cloud infrastructure, all working together to ensure data is reliably saved and retrievable when needed.",390.0,1559.0,2004,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.969768524169922,1.1878678798675537,7.362316131591797,storage engine,0.5
"Following the glass batch preparation and mixing, the raw materials are transported to the furnace. Soda-lime glass for mass production is melted in gas fired units. Smaller scale furnaces for specialty glasses include electric melters, pot furnaces, and day tanks. After melting, homogenization and refining (removal of bubbles), the glass is formed. Flat glass for windows and similar applications is formed by the float glass process, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity. The top surface of the glass is subjected to nitrogen under pressure to obtain a polished finish. Container glass for common bottles and jars is formed by blowing and pressing methods. This glass is often slightly modified chemically (with more alumina and calcium oxide) for greater water resistance. Further glass forming techniques are summarized in the table Glass forming techniques.",What is used on the surface of window glass to make it smooth?,nitrogen,1,DESC,"What is used on the surface of window glass to make it smooth?

Relevant context: Glass, in its raw form, is already relatively smooth due to the nature of its production. However, to achieve the ultra-smooth and clear surface found in window glass, several processes and materials can be utilized. One common method involves the use of cerium oxide, a fine polishing compound. Cerium oxide is applied to the surface of the glass during the final stages of production. It acts as a mild abrasive, removing microscopic imperfections and scratches that may be present on the surface. This polishing process not only smooths the glass surface but also enhances clarity and transparency.

Additionally, during the float glass manufacturing process, the glass itself is formed by floating molten glass on a bed of molten tin, which naturally yields a highly smooth and uniform surface. This technique is widely used for creating flat glass, such as that used in windows, due to the precision and quality of the finish it provides.

Surface coatings can also be applied to window glass to improve its smoothness and functionality. For instance, some windows are treated with thin layers of silicon-based coatings or vapor-deposited metal oxides to enhance durability, reduce glare, or increase resistance to environmental factors.

Further enhancements to smoothness and performance can be achieved through the application of various chemical solutions or films after the glass has been installed, which can provide additional optical or protective qualities. But fundamentally, the primary smoothing techniques rely on the controlled manufacturing environments and polishing processes that refine the glass to a state of near-perfect smoothness and clarity.",314.0,1805.0,2178,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,2.7438933849334717,4.328506231307983,8.232792854309082,Nitrogen,1.0
"It is considered that overeating and lack of muscle tone is the main cause of a beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.",What is the glycemic index in maltose?,110,1,DESC,"What is the glycemic index in maltose?

Relevant context: Certainly! 

When discussing the glycemic index (GI) of various carbohydrates, maltose is an important sugar to consider due to its presence in certain foods and its impact on blood glucose levels. Maltose, often referred to as malt sugar, is a disaccharide composed of two glucose units linked together. 

The glycemic index is a measure that ranks foods and drinks based on how quickly they raise blood glucose levels after consumption. Foods are scored on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating a faster rise in blood sugar. 

Maltose has a glycemic index of approximately 105, making it a high-GI carbohydrate. This is primarily because it is composed entirely of glucose, which is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. As such, foods high in maltose can cause a swift increase in blood sugar levels, which is a critical consideration for those managing conditions such as diabetes or insulin resistance.

It is important for individuals, particularly those with dietary concerns, to understand how maltose and foods containing maltose affect their overall glucose management. Foods and products that may contain maltose include malt beverages, breakfast cereals, and certain candies. For anyone concerned about blood sugar spikes, it may be beneficial to monitor the intake of maltose-rich foods.

In summary, maltose, with its glycemic index of about 105, acts as a fast-releasing carbohydrate, which can significantly influence postprandial glucose levels. This knowledge is vital for planning diets, especially for those who need to control their blood sugar levels through low-GI dietary choices.",329.0,1486.0,1869,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.019978046417236,1.662304162979126,7.994985103607178,110,1.0
"However loss resistance will generally affect the feedpoint impedance, adding to its resistive (real) component. That resistance will consist of the sum of the radiation resistance Rr and the loss resistance Rloss. If an rms current I is delivered to the terminals of an antenna, then a power of I2Rr will be radiated and a power of I2Rloss will be lost as heat. Therefore, the efficiency of an antenna is equal to Rr / (Rr + Rloss). Of course only the total resistance Rr + Rloss can be directly measured.",What is the single factor that can be precisely measured?,total resistance,1,DESC,"What is the single factor that can be precisely measured?

Relevant context: In the realm of measurement, precision is key. One factor that can be precisely measured with remarkable accuracy is time. Time is a continuous, quantifiable phenomenon that is essential for various fields ranging from physics to everyday human life. The precision of time measurement lies in its universal regularity and the advanced technology developed to keep track of it.

Historically, the measurement of time began with sundials and water clocks, offering approximations of time based on observable phenomena. However, scientific advancements have led to the introduction of atomic clocks, which measure time based on the vibrations of atoms, typically cesium or rubidium. Atomic clocks have revolutionized the way we keep time, achieving precision up to several billionths of a second. A cesium atom, for example, oscillates at precisely 9,192,631,770 times per second, a fact that forms the basis of the international definition of the second. 

Moreover, the measurement of time is integral to numerous technologies and scientific processes. For instance, Global Positioning System (GPS) technology depends on highly accurate time measurements to provide precise location data. Similarly, in scientific research, time measurement is crucial for experiments that require synchronization at ultra-fine scales.

In addition to the technological aspects, the uniformity of time makes it a perfect candidate for precise measurement. Unlike physical dimensions such as length or mass, which can be influenced by environmental factors, time remains unaffected, providing stability and consistency across contexts. This universality allows time to be a foundational standard upon which other measurements are calibrated.

In conclusion, among various measurable factors, time stands out as one that can be precisely quantified thanks to atomic clocks and its inherent uniformity. This precision has profound implications for technology, science, and the structuring of modern society, making it an indispensable factor in our understanding of the world.",380.0,1560.0,1995,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6642374992370605,1.908383846282959,6.6858625411987305,Time,0.0
"Direction lanterns are also found both inside and outside elevator cars, but they should always be visible from outside because their primary purpose is to help people decide whether or not to get on the elevator.

If the person waits, then one will still stop going up. Direction indicators are sometimes etched with arrows or shaped like arrows and/or use the convention that one that lights up red means ""down"" and green means ""up"". Since the color convention is often undermined or overridden by systems that do not invoke it, it is usually used only in conjunction with other differentiating factors. An example of a place whose elevators use only the color convention to differentiate between directions is the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, where a single circle can be made to light up green for ""up"" and red for ""down"". Sometimes directions must be inferred by the position of the indicators relative to one another.",What might change your mind about whether or not to enter an elevator?,"If somebody waiting for the elevator wants to go up, but a car comes first that indicates that it is going down",1,DESC,"What might change your mind about whether or not to enter an elevator?

Relevant context: When considering whether to enter an elevator, several factors might influence your decision and potentially change your mind. First and foremost, safety concerns are paramount. If there are visible signs of malfunction, such as flickering lights, strange noises, or a bouncing floor, you might decide against entering. Additionally, if an elevator technician has posted warnings or if there's an ""Out of Service"" sign, these are obvious deterrents.

Crowding is another factor. During peak times, an elevator may already be quite full. If you feel that it exceeds a comfortable or safe capacity, you might choose to wait for the next one. In cases of a pandemic or concerns about infectious diseases, the density of occupants and the space available for social distancing can heavily influence your decision.

Your physical state or personal circumstances could also play a role. For example, if you are feeling claustrophobic, anxious, or unwell, you might be more hesitant to enter an elevator, opting instead for stairs if that option is available and feasible. Similarly, if you are in a hurry and notice that the elevator is functioning slowly or requiring multiple stops, you might decide to take the stairs to save time.

The perceived reliability of the elevator based on past experiences may affect your choice. If you’ve experienced issues with a particular elevator in the past, such as frequent breakdowns or getting stuck, you would likely be more cautious or avoid that particular elevator altogether.

Finally, social factors might influence your decision. If someone suspicious or threatening enters or is already inside, you might not feel comfortable sharing the space with them. Conversely, if a friend or someone you need to discuss something with enters the elevator, you might be more inclined to join them.

All of these factors contribute to the complex decision-making process when determining whether or not to enter an elevator.

The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA. The phylum Planctomycetes and candidate phylum Poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria, because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures. Like all living organisms, bacteria contain ribosomes, often grouped in chains called polyribosomes, for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea. Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S (measured in Svedberg units): their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S. Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80S ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host.",What are the exceptions of non-internal membrane bacteria?,phylum Planctomycetes and candidate phylum Poribacteria,1,DESC,"What are the exceptions of non-internal membrane bacteria?

Relevant context: While the majority of bacteria lack internal membranes or membrane-bound organelles, there are noteworthy exceptions that challenge this general understanding. Among these exceptions are the Planctomycetes, a phylum of bacteria that exhibit a more complex cellular organization.

Planctomycetes are known for their compartmentalized cell structure, which includes membrane-bound organelles. One of the most significant features of Planctomycetes is the presence of a nuclear body, enclosed by a double membrane, which resembles the eukaryotic nucleus. This compartment contains the bacterium's genomic DNA, separated from the cytoplasm in a way that is uncommon among prokaryotes.

Another exception is found in the photosynthetic cyanobacteria, some of which contain specialized internal membranes known as thylakoids. Thylakoids are the site of photosynthetic reactions and are structurally similar to those found in the chloroplasts of eukaryotic plant cells. These internal membranes increase the surface area available for photosynthesis, enhancing the bacteria's ability to capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy.

Additionally, the genus Gemmata, within the Planctomycetes, is notable for having a particularly complex internal membrane system. Gemmata obscuriglobus, for example, not only demonstrates a membrane-bound nucleoid but also an intricate network of internal membranes that contribute to its spatial organization and functionality.

These exceptions illustrate that while the lack of internal membranes is a common feature of bacterial cells, evolutionary variations can lead to unexpectedly complex internal structures. The study of these unique bacterial systems broadens our understanding of cellular evolution and the diversity of life forms.

"A P-N junction can convert absorbed light energy into a proportional electric current. The same process is reversed here (i.e. the P-N junction emits light when electrical energy is applied to it). This phenomenon is generally called electroluminescence, which can be defined as the emission of light from a semi-conductor under the influence of an electric field. The charge carriers recombine in a forward-biased P-N junction as the electrons cross from the N-region and recombine with the holes existing in the P-region. Free electrons are in the conduction band of energy levels, while holes are in the valence energy band. Thus the energy level of the holes will be lesser than the energy levels of the electrons. Some portion of the energy must be dissipated in order to recombine the electrons and the holes. This energy is emitted in the form of heat and light.",What converts absorbed light energy into an electric current?,P-N junction,1,DESC,"What converts absorbed light energy into an electric current?

Relevant context: The conversion of absorbed light energy into an electric current is primarily facilitated by a device known as a photovoltaic cell, commonly referred to as a solar cell. Photovoltaic cells are the foundational units of solar panels, and they operate based on the photovoltaic effect, a process discovered by the French physicist Alexandre Edmond Becquerel in 1839.

At the heart of a photovoltaic cell is a semiconducting material, typically silicon, which is specially treated to create a P-N junction. When photons from sunlight strike the photovoltaic cell, they transfer their energy to electrons in the semiconductor material. This energy excites the electrons, allowing them to break free from their atomic bonds. As these free electrons move through the material, they leave behind ""holes"" — places where an electron is absent.

The design of the photovoltaic cell forces these free electrons to move in a single direction towards the N-type layer, where they accumulate. Meanwhile, holes migrate in the opposite direction toward the P-type layer. This separation of charges generates a voltage, and when a conductive path is provided, an electric current flows, thus converting light energy into electrical energy.

To optimize this process, modern photovoltaic cells often include additional layers and coatings to increase efficiency by capturing a wider spectrum of sunlight, minimizing reflection, and reducing electron recombination.

In summary, the conversion of absorbed light energy into an electric current in photovoltaic cells involves the excitation of electrons and their subsequent movement, creating a flow of electricity that can be harnessed to power electrical devices and systems. This conversion is pivotal for renewable energy generation and plays a critical role in reducing reliance on fossil fuels.",336.0,1242.0,1634,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.682783842086792,1.1805856227874756,5.945317506790161,P-N junction,1.0
"The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction. Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping ""wasn't very obvious"" due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface, even by the video tutorial added on the RTM release (which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides). Despite this ""stumbling block"", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the ""Metro"" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was ""as stunning as it is surprising"", contributing to an ""incredibly personal"" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be ""clumsy and impractical"" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it ""two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together""), and concluded that ""Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.""",What makes the Windows 8 interface difficult to use?,the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface,1,DESC,"What makes the Windows 8 interface difficult to use?

Relevant context: When Microsoft released Windows 8, it marked a significant departure from the traditional Windows interface, which contributed to its reputation for being difficult to use. One of the most prominent changes was the introduction of the Start Screen, replacing the familiar Start Menu that had been a staple since Windows 95. This new Start Screen was designed to be touch-friendly, featuring large tiles and a flat, colorful design intended for tablets and other touch-enabled devices. However, for desktop and laptop users who relied on mouse and keyboard inputs, this new interface often felt awkward and unintuitive.

The absence of the Start Menu meant that users had to navigate through the Start Screen to access applications, which could be cumbersome and confusing. Instead of neatly organized lists, programs were represented as large tiles that sprawled across a horizontal canvas. This layout disrupted the workflow for users accustomed to quickly finding their applications through a structured menu system.

Another area where users struggled was the introduction of the ""Charms Bar,"" an enigmatic feature intended to provide quick access to settings, search, sharing, and device options. The Charms Bar would appear when the user swiped from the right edge of the screen or moved the mouse to the top-right corner, a gesture that was not immediately obvious or intuitive for many users, especially those without touch-enabled devices.

Furthermore, Windows 8 removed traditional windowing and multitasking features that users had come to rely on. The ""Metro"" or ""Modern"" app views were full-screen, which made it difficult to switch between applications quickly. While there was an option to snap apps side by side, the process was not straightforward. The lack of windowed options made multitasking less efficient, particularly for users who were not using touch devices.

Additionally, the simultaneous existence of two different environments— the desktop and the Start Screen or ""Modern UI""—was a source of confusion. Users would often find themselves switching between modes without intending to, as they launched some applications that defaulted to either the older desktop interface or the modern, full-screen mode. This dual interface system fractured the user experience and made it harder for users to perform tasks smoothly.

In summary, Windows 8's interface introduced several radical changes aimed at touch interfaces, which inadvertently alienated and confused many traditional desktop users. The removal of the Start Menu, the introduction of the Charms Bar, the challenge of multitasking in the Modern UI, and the awkward coexistence of two different interfaces all contributed to the perception of Windows 8 as difficult to use, especially for those who relied heavily on mouse and keyboard navigation.",528.0,2089.0,2674,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,6.5226593017578125,1.300210952758789,9.015776634216309,Inconsistent design,0.0

Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.",What is a gene?,a locus (or region) of DNA that encodes a functional RNA or protein product,1,DESC,"What is a gene?

Relevant context: A gene is a fundamental unit of heredity in living organisms. It is a segment of DNA, or in some viruses, RNA, that contains the necessary instructions to produce a specific molecule, typically a protein, that plays a crucial role in the structure, function, and regulation of the body's cells, tissues, and organs. Genes are located on chromosomes, which are long strands of DNA found in the nucleus of cells. In humans, each cell typically contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46.

The structure of a gene includes several key components: the promoter, which is a sequence that signals where the transcription of a gene should begin; exons, which are coding sequences that are expressed; and introns, non-coding sequences that are spliced out during the process of RNA maturation. The process of gene expression involves transcription, where the DNA sequence of a gene is copied to mRNA, and translation, where this mRNA is used as a template to assemble amino acids into a protein.

Genes are responsible for the hereditary transmission of traits from parents to offspring. Variations in genes, caused by mutations, can lead to differences in physical characteristics and may predispose individuals to certain health conditions. The complete set of genes within an organism is referred to as its genome. Advances in genomic research have led to a better understanding of genetic disorders and have opened pathways for personalized medicine, where treatments can be tailored based on an individual's genetic profile.

Overall, genes are critical to the biological processes that sustain life and contribute significantly to the diversity observed within and across species.

"According to Mendelian inheritance, variations in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are due in part to variations in its genotype (particular set of genes). Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence of a gene (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.:20","According to Mendelian inheritance, what is part of the cause of variations in an organism's phenotype?",variations in its genotype,1,DESC,"According to Mendelian inheritance, what is part of the cause of variations in an organism's phenotype?

Relevant context: According to Mendelian inheritance, variations in an organism's phenotype are primarily caused by the different combinations of alleles inherited from the parents. Gregor Mendel, through his experiments with pea plants, discovered that traits are passed on from parents to offspring in discrete units known as genes. Each gene may have different versions, called alleles, which can dictate the variation of a trait.

In Mendelian inheritance, each organism inherits two alleles for each gene, one from each parent. These alleles can be dominant or recessive, which influences the organism's phenotype – the observable characteristics. For instance, if a gene has a dominant allele (represented by a capital letter, such as 'A') and a recessive allele (represented by a lowercase letter, such as 'a'), the presence of the dominant allele in either heterozygous form ('Aa') or homozygous form ('AA') will typically determine the dominant phenotype.

These different combinations of alleles come about through the processes of segregation and independent assortment, key principles described by Mendel. During meiosis, which is the process of forming gametes (sperm and egg cells), pairs of alleles segregate so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. Furthermore, genes located on different chromosomes are assorted independently into gametes, meaning the inheritance of one trait generally does not affect the inheritance of another. This provides a mechanism for creating genetic diversity, as offspring can inherit any combination of alleles from the pool available in their parents.

In addition to these basic principles, variations in phenotype can also arise from mutations in the alleles, genetic recombination during meiosis, and interaction with environmental factors. However, the fundamental framework of Mendelian inheritance centers on the segregation and independent assortment of alleles, which explains much of the genetic variation we observe in offspring compared to their parents.",396.0,1496.0,1957,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.169576406478882,1.1281473636627197,7.45638108253479,Genotype,0.5
"Rather than teach small parts of a large number of subjects, Whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge, discovering their application in actual life. For Whitehead, education should be the exact opposite of the multidisciplinary, value-free school model – it should be transdisciplinary, and laden with values and general principles that provide students with a bedrock of wisdom and help them to make connections between areas of knowledge that are usually regarded as separate.",How did Whitehead propose that students would expand their knowledge beyond the subjects taught in school?,"important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge, discovering their application in actual life",1,DESC,"How did Whitehead propose that students would expand their knowledge beyond the subjects taught in school?

Relevant context: Alfred North Whitehead, a prominent philosopher and educator, had a distinctive view on how students should expand their knowledge beyond the formal curriculum provided in schools. According to Whitehead, the essence of education lies not merely in the absorption of isolated facts, but in awakening the desire for further inquiry and understanding. He famously emphasized the importance of cultivating a love of learning that surpasses the boundaries of conventional subjects.

Whitehead argued that education should not be confined to rigid compartments of distinct subjects; rather, it should inspire students to see the interconnectedness of knowledge. He proposed that students expand their knowledge by engaging in interdisciplinary exploration, where concepts from one subject illuminate and enhance understanding in another. For instance, understanding the principles of mathematics could enrich a student's appreciation of music, while historical contexts could deepen their grasp of literature.

Moreover, Whitehead believed that learning should be contextual and experiential, urging educators to encourage students to engage with the real world as a laboratory of learning. He proposed that students participate in activities that provoke critical thinking and practical application, such as project-based learning, independent research, and hands-on experiences beyond the classroom. These activities not only deepen subject knowledge but also cultivate intrinsic motivation and curiosity.

Whitehead also highlighted the importance of teaching students how to learn—not just what to learn. This involves developing critical skills, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and the ability to adapt and synthesize information from diverse sources. By fostering these skills, students are better equipped to pursue lifelong learning and adapt to new and emerging fields of knowledge.

In summary, Whitehead's proposal for expanding student knowledge involved breaking down the silos of traditional subjects, encouraging interdisciplinary connections, engaging in real-world experiences, and fostering skills necessary for continuous, self-directed learning. Through this holistic and dynamic approach, education becomes a gateway to endless exploration and intellectual growth.",387.0,1400.0,1852,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.635479688644409,1.1539802551269531,7.009128093719482,Transdisciplinary connections,0.8

"Most of an annelid's body consists of segments that are practically identical, having the same sets of internal organs and external chaetae (Greek χαιτη, meaning ""hair"") and, in some species, appendages. However, the frontmost and rearmost sections are not regarded as true segments as they do not contain the standard sets of organs and do not develop in the same way as the true segments. The frontmost section, called the prostomium (Greek προ- meaning ""in front of"" and στομα meaning ""mouth"") contains the brain and sense organs, while the rearmost, called the pygidium (Greek πυγιδιον, meaning ""little tail"") or periproct contains the anus, generally on the underside.

Relevant context: Chaetae are bristle-like structures found on the bodies of certain invertebrates, most notably within the phylum Annelida, which includes segmented worms such as earthworms and polychaetes. These structures are composed primarily of chitin, a fibrous substance that also forms the exoskeleton of arthropods. Chaetae play a crucial role in the locomotion and sensory functions of these organisms. 

In oligochaetes, like earthworms, chaetae are used to anchor segments against a substrate, allowing these creatures to inch forward by alternating contractions of their longitudinal and circular muscles. This movement mechanism is vital for burrowing and exploring their terrestrial habitats. In polychaetes, which are predominantly marine, chaetae are often more elaborate and may be modified into various forms such as hooks or paddles, assisting these worms in swimming or crawling over ocean sediments. 

Additionally, chaetae can serve as a defensive feature. Sharp and robust, they can deter predators or help the worm navigate and remain secure within its burrow or tube. In some species, the chaetae are coupled with toxic secretions as an added layer of protection.

The presence and specific structure of chaetae are commonly used for identification and classification within annelid groups, providing insights into their ecological roles and evolutionary relationships.

"Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they believe that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences. They favor biologically-based theories, which point to genetic factors, the early uterine environment, both, or the inclusion of genetic and social factors. There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role when it comes to sexual orientation. Research over several decades has demonstrated that sexual orientation ranges along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the opposite sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex.",What three factors do scientists believe are the cause of sexual orientation?,"genetic, hormonal, and environmental",1,DESC,"What three factors do scientists believe are the cause of sexual orientation?

Relevant context: Sexual orientation is a complex trait that scientists believe arises from a combination of biological, environmental, and possibly genetic factors. Research in this area is ongoing, and while there may not be a single, definitive cause of sexual orientation, several prevailing theories help explain its origins.

Firstly, biological factors, particularly prenatal hormonal influences, are considered significant. It is suggested that the exposure to varying levels of hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen, during critical periods of fetal development can influence brain differentiation and subsequent sexual orientation. For example, atypical hormone conditions, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), provide some evidence of this, as females with CAH often exhibit more traditionally masculine traits and may have a higher likelihood of same-sex attraction. Additionally, structural differences in certain brain regions, like the hypothalamus, have been observed between heterosexual and homosexual individuals, which may relate to the hormonal environment experienced in utero.

Secondly, genetic factors are also thought to play a crucial role. Twin studies, which compare the sexual orientation of twins, indicate a genetic component because identical twins have a higher concordance rate for sexual orientation than fraternal twins. Researchers have identified specific genetic markers that appear more frequently in people who are not heterosexual. However, no ""gay gene"" has been definitively isolated, leading to the belief that multiple genes likely contribute to sexual orientation, possibly interacting with environmental factors.

Lastly, certain environmental influences, including social and cultural factors, are believed to contribute to shaping sexual orientation, though their impact is likely less pronounced than biological and genetic factors. Family dynamics, cultural norms, and personal experiences can influence the expression and realization of sexual orientation, although they are not considered primary determinants. For instance, the social acceptance of different sexual orientations can impact when and how individuals explore and declare their sexual preferences.

In summary, the interplay of prenatal biological factors, potential genetic influences, and various environmental and cultural conditions are believed to collaborate in the development of an individual's sexual orientation. While much is still not fully understood, these three factors provide a framework for scientists studying this multifaceted aspect of human identity.",435.0,1559.0,2056,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,7.762624025344849,1.2373533248901367,10.779754400253296,"Genetic, hormonal, environmental",0.9
"Insects (from Latin insectum, a calque of Greek ἔντομον [éntomon], ""cut into sections"") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.",What does insect mean in latin?,cut into sections,1,DESC,"What does insect mean in latin?

Relevant context: The word ""insect"" in English can be traced back to its Latin origin, the term ""insectum."" In Latin, ""insectum"" is the neuter form of the participle ""insectus,"" which is derived from the verb ""insecare."" This verb translates to ""to cut into"" or ""to cut up,"" a reference to the segmented bodies of insects. This characteristic segmentation plays a crucial role in the identification and classification of insects within the animal kingdom.

The concept of ""cutting into"" relates to how the bodies of insects are divided into distinct parts, typically the head, thorax, and abdomen. This structural feature was significant enough to influence the very name of this diverse class of arthropods in the Latin language.

Furthermore, the Latin term ""insectum"" carried forward into scientific nomenclature and was later adopted into other languages, forming the basis for the word ""insect"" in English and equivalents in several Indo-European languages. It serves as a testament to the influence of Latin in scientific terminology, particularly in the field of biology, where many taxa and anatomical features bear Latin names that describe their defining characteristics.

"Double fertilization refers to a process in which two sperm cells fertilize cells in the ovary. This process begins when a pollen grain adheres to the stigma of the pistil (female reproductive structure), germinates, and grows a long pollen tube. While this pollen tube is growing, a haploid generative cell travels down the tube behind the tube nucleus. The generative cell divides by mitosis to produce two haploid (n) sperm cells. As the pollen tube grows, it makes its way from the stigma, down the style and into the ovary. Here the pollen tube reaches the micropyle of the ovule and digests its way into one of the synergids, releasing its contents (which include the sperm cells). The synergid that the cells were released into degenerates and one sperm makes its way to fertilize the egg cell, producing a diploid (2n) zygote. The second sperm cell fuses with both central cell nuclei, producing a triploid (3n) cell. As the zygote develops into an embryo, the triploid cell develops into the endosperm, which serves as the embryo's food supply. The ovary now will develop into fruit and the ovule will develop into seed.",What process does double fertilization refer to?,two sperm cells fertilize cells in the ovary,1,DESC,"What process does double fertilization refer to?

Relevant context: Double fertilization is a unique and complex reproductive process that occurs in flowering plants, also known as angiosperms. This process involves two separate fertilization events within the ovule, orchestrating the development of both the zygote and the endosperm, which are crucial for seed development.

The process begins when a pollen grain lands on the stigma of a flower and germinates, forming a pollen tube that extends through the style towards the ovule contained within the ovary. The pollen grain contains two male sperm cells. As the pollen tube reaches the ovule, it penetrates the micropyle, the opening at the apex of the ovule.

Inside the ovule, the embryo sac harbors several important cells: the egg cell, two synergids, three antipodal cells, and a central cell containing two polar nuclei. The first fertilization event occurs when one of the sperm cells fuses with the egg cell, resulting in the formation of a diploid zygote. This zygote will eventually develop into the embryo of the seed.

The second fertilization event occurs almost simultaneously when the other sperm cell unites with the two polar nuclei in the central cell. This fusion results in the formation of a triploid cell, which develops into the endosperm. The endosperm acts as a nourishing tissue, providing essential nutrients to the developing embryo during seed germination.

Double fertilization is integral to the reproductive success of angiosperms, as it ensures that the resources necessary for the embryo's growth are produced only if fertilization occurs. This efficiency is one reason for the diverse success of flowering plants on Earth. Additionally, the endosperm's role can vary significantly among species, with some plants developing it before seed maturation, while others use it as a nutrient source during germination.

In summary, double fertilization in angiosperms is a two-part fertilization process that simultaneously gives rise to both the embryo and the nutritive tissue required for its development, exemplifying a highly efficient reproductive strategy.",422.0,1834.0,2318,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.568520784378052,1.260451078414917,7.880990982055664,Two sperm cells fertilizing cells in the ovary,0.9
"All animals have eukaryotic cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins. This may be calcified to form structures like shells, bones, and spicules. During development, it forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized, making complex structures possible. In contrast, other multicellular organisms, like plants and fungi, have cells held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth. Also, unique to animal cells are the following intercellular junctions: tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.",How are cells held in place in plants and fungi?,cell walls,1,DESC,"How are cells held in place in plants and fungi?

Relevant context: In both plants and fungi, cells are held in place and maintained in specific structures through unique features of their cellular organization and the composition of their cell walls. 

In plants, the primary mechanism that holds cells together is the presence of a rigid cell wall composed mainly of cellulose. This cell wall provides structural support, aiding in the formation of the plant's shape and allowing it to withstand turgor pressure from the inside. Adjacent plant cells are connected by the middle lamella, a pectin-rich layer that acts as a kind of ""glue"" binding the cells together. Pectin, a polysaccharide, operates by cross-linking with calcium ions, which fortifies the structure, ensuring that the cells remain in a specific arrangement. Moreover, plant cells are interconnected by plasmodesmata, channels that traverse cell walls, allowing for communication and transport of substances between cells, further stabilizing the cellular network.

Similarly, fungi have a cell wall that plays a critical role in holding cells in place. Fungal cell walls are primarily composed of chitin, a long-chain polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, which provides rigidity and structural support, much like cellulose in plants. In many fungi, the wall also contains other polysaccharides such as glucans and mannans, which contribute to the cell wall’s integrity and plasticity. Unlike in plants, fungi grow hyphae, which are long, thread-like structures made up of cells arranged in a string. The cells within a hypha are often separated by septa, or walls with pores that allow the passage of nutrients and organelles, maintaining a cohesive structure while facilitating communication and resource distribution throughout the organism.

In both plants and fungi, the rigidity and interconnectedness of cell walls are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the organism, allowing them to grow, develop, and survive in their respective environments. Thus, the composition and arrangement of cell walls and the substances that connect them are vital for the spatial organization and mechanical support of these cells.",418.0,1725.0,2199,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,3.535569190979004,2.0759685039520264,6.72995924949646,Cell walls,1.0
"Transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to be a consequence of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles, rather than a bacterial adaptation. Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system is determined by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for transferring copies of the plasmid from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium. Plasmid-mediated transfer of host bacterial DNA also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation.",What is the aftermath of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles?,Transduction of bacterial genes,1,DESC,"What is the aftermath of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles?

Relevant context: During the intracellular assembly of virus particles, a highly coordinated process occurs where viral components, such as proteins and nucleic acids, come together to form mature virions. However, infrequent errors can occur during this assembly process, which can lead to several potential outcomes.

Firstly, these errors might result in the production of non-infectious viral particles. For example, a misfolded protein could prevent the correct assembly or stability of the viral capsid, the protein shell of a virus. As a result, these incomplete or aberrant particles lack the ability to infect new host cells, thereby reducing the overall viral load within an infected organism. Although these particles are non-functional in terms of replication, they may still provoke an immune response. The immune system can recognize these aberrant particles and generate antibodies against viral antigens, potentially enhancing host immunity.

Secondly, errors in the assembly process can lead to the encapsidation of incorrect or truncated genomic material. Such aberrations might produce defective interfering particles (DIPs), which contain incomplete viral genomes. DIPs are particularly interesting because they can interfere with the replication of standard virions. This interference can occur when these defective particles compete with complete viruses for cellular resources, such as proteins and nucleotides, required for replication. Although DIPs on their own are not capable of causing an infection, their presence can lessen the severity of a viral infection, as fewer functional viral particles are produced.

Another consequence of assembly errors could involve the packaging of host cellular material instead of viral components. Occasionally, cellular RNA or proteins become included in viral particles, potentially altering the pathogenic properties of the virus. In rare circumstances, such errors might result in evolutionary advantages, introducing new functionalities or resistances through a process similar to horizontal gene transfer.

It is important to note that while individual errors during assembly can have detrimental effects on the infectivity and virulence of virions, they are typically not advantageous to the virus. Over evolutionary timescales, viruses have developed robust mechanisms to minimize the frequency of these errors to optimize their survival and transmission.

Overall, although infrequent errors during the intracellular assembly of viruses do occur, they often result in less infectious viral particles that can influence viral dynamics and host interactions in various ways, potentially impacting viral spread, immune evasion, and pathogenicity.",478.0,1487.0,2025,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,4.264548063278198,1.1015419960021973,6.576903343200684,Transduction,0.5

"Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. Many types of bacteriophage exist, some simply infect and lyse their host bacteria, while others insert into the bacterial chromosome. A bacteriophage can contain genes that contribute to its host's phenotype: for example, in the evolution of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Clostridium botulinum, the toxin genes in an integrated phage converted a harmless ancestral bacterium into a lethal pathogen. Bacteria resist phage infection through restriction modification systems that degrade foreign DNA, and a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. This CRISPR system provides bacteria with acquired immunity to infection.",What are Bacteriophages?,viruses that infect bacteria,1,DESC,"What are Bacteriophages?

Relevant context: Bacteriophages, often simply referred to as phages, are a type of virus that specifically infects and replicates within bacteria. The name ""bacteriophage"" literally means ""bacteria eater,"" derived from 'bacteria' and the Greek word 'phagein', meaning ‘to devour.’ These microscopic entities play a significant role in regulating bacterial populations in various environments, from oceans and soil to the human gut.

Structurally, bacteriophages are diverse, but they typically consist of a nucleic acid core (either DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protective protein coat, known as a capsid. Some phages possess additional structures, such as tail fibers, which help them attach to their bacterial hosts. Phages are highly specific to their bacterial targets, often infecting a single species or even specific strains within a species.

The lifecycle of a bacteriophage can be primarily divided into two types: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle. In the lytic cycle, after attaching to a bacterium, the phage injects its genetic material into the host cell. The phage DNA hijacks the bacterial machinery, directing it to produce more phage components. These components are then assembled into new phage particles, which eventually cause the bacterial cell to burst (lyse), releasing the new phages to infect other bacterial cells.

In contrast, during the lysogenic cycle, the phage's genetic material is integrated into the host bacterium's genome, where it can remain dormant for extended periods. This integrated phage DNA, known as a prophage, is replicated along with the host's DNA during cell division. Environmental factors or stress conditions can trigger the prophage to reactivate, entering the lytic cycle.

Bacteriophages have garnered significant interest for their potential applications in medicine, particularly as an alternative to traditional antibiotics. This interest is driven by the rising problem of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Phage therapy, the therapeutic use of bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections, leverages their ability to specifically target and kill pathogenic bacteria without harming beneficial bacteria or the host's cells.

Moreover, bacteriophages are crucial tools in molecular biology and genetic engineering. Their ability to transfer genetic material between bacteria has been harnessed in various applications, including vaccine development and the study of bacterial genetics.

In summary, bacteriophages are a fascinating group of viruses that exert a profound influence on microbial ecosystems and offer promising avenues for medical and biotechnological innovation.

Relevant context: Professional wrestling is a form of entertainment that combines athletics and theatrical performance to create scripted matches and storylines. Unlike amateur wrestling, which is a legitimate competitive sport, professional wrestling is characterized by predetermined outcomes and choreographed moves designed to showcase the skills and agility of the performers, often referred to as ""wrestlers"" or ""superstars.""

The roots of professional wrestling can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where it began as a carnival attraction in North America and Europe. Over the years, it evolved, incorporating more elaborate personas, costumes, and storylines, which helped it gain popularity as a form of mass entertainment.

Modern professional wrestling is most famously exemplified by promotions such as World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), All Elite Wrestling (AEW), and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). These organizations produce live events, television shows, and pay-per-view specials that draw millions of fans worldwide.

Wrestlers often adopt unique ring names and personas, ranging from hero-like ""babyfaces"" to villainous ""heels,"" and participate in ongoing narratives that unfold over weeks or months. These storylines are designed to heighten drama and engage the audience, often culminating in climactic matches that serve as the payoff for the build-up.

Matches in professional wrestling can vary widely in style and type. Traditional singles matches feature two competitors, while tag team matches involve teams of two or more wrestlers on each side. There are also specialty matches such as ladder matches, cage matches, and royal rumbles, each offering unique challenges and visual spectacles.

While the outcomes are scripted and the violence is simulated, professional wrestling requires a high level of athleticism, coordination, and skill. Wrestlers undergo rigorous training to execute complex maneuvers safely and convincingly, and they must also possess strong improvisational and acting abilities to effectively portray their characters and react to the audience.

Critics of professional wrestling may point to its staged nature, but fans appreciate it as a unique blend of sport and storytelling. The theatricality and drama enhance the experience, allowing audiences to become emotionally invested in the characters and their journeys.

Relevant context: A re-introduction scheme is a conservation strategy aimed at reestablishing populations of species in areas where they have become extinct or are no longer present naturally. These schemes are meticulously planned and executed projects that involve several stages and require collaboration among conservationists, scientists, local governments, and often the local community. 

The process typically begins with a comprehensive feasibility study, which assesses the historical range of the species, the causes of its decline or extinction, and whether these threats have been sufficiently mitigated. This is crucial to ensure that the conditions that led to the species' disappearance do not persist. Once feasibility is determined, suitable habitats are carefully selected based on ecological requirements, availability of prey (for predators), and the presence of necessary vegetation or other environmental factors.

The next step involves sourcing individuals for re-introduction. These might come from captive breeding programs, where animals are bred and prepared in zoological facilities, or from other wild populations, where translocations might be feasible. The health, genetic diversity, and adaptability of the species are important considerations, ensuring that the population has enough genetic variation to thrive over the long term.

Before release, the scheme often includes a period of acclimatization, allowing the animals to adjust to the environment and conditions they will face in the wild. Once released, comprehensive monitoring programs are established to track the progress of the reintroduced population. This might involve GPS tracking collars, population surveys, and health assessments to gauge survival rates, reproductive success, and ecological impacts.

A successful re-introduction scheme also requires engagement with the local community. Education and involvement are crucial to gain support, reduce possible human-wildlife conflicts, and encourage conservation efforts. In many cases, these schemes also promote biodiversity and ecosystem restoration, offering broader ecological benefits.

Re-introduction schemes have been globally recognized as a critical tool in biodiversity conservation. Notable examples include the re-introduction of wolves into Yellowstone National Park, which has had profound ecological benefits, and the return of the European bison to parts of its former range. While such projects are complex and resource-intensive, they play a vital role in the broader efforts to preserve the planet’s biodiversity and restore natural ecosystems.",446.0,1312.0,1815,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6747965812683105,1.2163891792297363,6.132305860519409,Deliberate introduction of species,0.0
"Thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900–14,000 nanometers or 0.9–14 μm) and produce images of that radiation. Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures, according to the black body radiation law, thermography makes it possible to ""see"" one's environment with or without visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature, therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature (hence the name).",What happens to the amount of radiation an object emits as temperature increases?,increases,1,DESC,"What happens to the amount of radiation an object emits as temperature increases?

Relevant context: As the temperature of an object increases, the amount of radiation it emits also increases. This relationship is governed by principles in the field of thermodynamics and is quantitatively described by Planck's law of blackbody radiation. According to this law, every object absorbs and emits electromagnetic radiation. A crucial aspect of this is that the total energy emitted per unit surface area of the object tends to increase with the fourth power of its absolute temperature (measured in kelvin). This phenomenon is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the total emitted radiation \( E \), also known as the radiant energy, from a perfect blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature \( T \). Mathematically, this is expressed as \( E = \sigma T^4 \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Furthermore, not only does the quantity of emitted radiation increase with temperature, but the nature of the radiation itself changes too. As an object gets hotter, the peak wavelength of the emitted radiation becomes shorter, moving from infrared toward visible range and beyond. This is described by Wien's Displacement Law, which states that the wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) at which the emission is maximal is inversely proportional to the temperature, given by \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant.

In practical terms, this means that a cool object like a person emits most of its radiation in the longer infrared wavelengths. However, as the object's temperature increases, it starts to emit more energy at shorter wavelengths. For example, a metal filament in a light bulb when heated, begins to glow and thus emits visible light as its temperature rises. Thus, both the intensity and the spectrum of an object’s electromagnetic radiation provide insightful information regarding its temperature. This principle has practical applications in various fields, such as astrophysics, where it helps determine the temperature of distant stars by analyzing the light they emit.",431.0,1517.0,2007,1.0,0.14285714285714285,0.3333333333333333,3.870792865753174,1.175879955291748,6.210181713104248,Increases,1.0
"Before emerging as a pop star, Madonna has spent her early years in rock music alongside her bands, Breakfast Club and Emmy. While performing with Emmy, Madonna recorded about 12-14 songs which resemble the punk rock of that period. Her early rock roots also can be found on the demo album Pre-Madonna. Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that with her self-titled debut album, Madonna began her career as a disco diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the beginning of the '80's, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and according to Erlewine, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music. The album's songs reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy hooks, highly polished arrangements and Madonna's own vocal style. Her second album, Like a Virgin (1984), foreshadowed several trends in her later works. It contained references to classical works (pizzicato synthesizer line that opens ""Angel""); potential negative reaction from social groups (""Dress You Up"" was blacklisted by the Parents Music Resource Center); and retro styles (""Shoo-Bee-Doo"", Madonna's homage to Motown).",What is Madonna's second album?,Like a Virgin,1,DESC,"What is Madonna's second album?

"Since the Industrial Revolution some two hundred years ago, the food processing industry has invented many technologies that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature. Cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled. These latter technologies include pasteurisation, autoclavation, drying, salting, and separation of various components, all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food. Pasteurisation and autoclavation (heating techniques) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods, preventing epidemics of bacterial infection. But some of the (new) food processing technologies have downfalls as well.",Pasteurisation is an an example of a technology that aims to do what to food?,last longer without becoming spoiled,1,DESC,"Pasteurisation is an an example of a technology that aims to do what to food?

Relevant context: Pasteurization is a technology that aims primarily to enhance the safety of food and extend its shelf life by reducing the presence of harmful microorganisms. This process, named after the French scientist Louis Pasteur who developed it in the 19th century, involves heating food and liquids to a specific temperature for a set period of time, followed by rapid cooling. The goal is to destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses, molds, and other microbes that can cause foodborne illnesses, while minimizing changes to the taste and nutritional value of the food.

A key advantage of pasteurization is its efficacy in inactivating many known pathogens without resorting to the high temperatures used in sterilization, which can significantly alter the texture and flavor of food. Milk, one of the most common products subjected to pasteurization, is typically heated under conditions such as 72°C (161°F) for 15 seconds in a method known as High-Temperature Short-Time (HTST) pasteurization. Other methods include Ultra-High Temperature (UHT) processing, which heats the milk to 135°C (275°F) for 2 to 5 seconds, resulting in even longer shelf life.

Pasteurization not only targets dangerous bacteria such as Salmonella, Listeria, and Escherichia coli but also helps in controlling microorganisms that cause spoilage, thus keeping food fresh longer. This technology is applied to a wide range of foods, including juices, dairy products, canned foods, and even some alcoholic beverages.

Relevant context: Certainly! Over the past few decades, a notable societal trend has been the evolving perception of what constitutes family and home, with an increasing number of people including dogs as integral members of their households. This shift can be attributed to several cultural and social factors. 

Firstly, the growing sentiment of dogs as ""fur babies"" reflects a deepened emotional bond between humans and their canine companions. Many individuals and families now view dogs not merely as pets, but as family members who warrant the same care, attention, and affection as human relatives. This phenomenon is evidenced by the rising expenditure on pet care products and services, including premium pet foods, health insurance, and even luxury items tailored for dogs. 

Moreover, legislation across various regions has adapted to accommodate this trend, with more housing developments, workplaces, and public spaces becoming dog-friendly. The increased presence of dogs in everyday family-centric activities — from vacations to holiday celebrations — further underscores their integral role within the family unit.

Additionally, the media has played a significant role in framing this narrative, with movies, advertising, and social media often portraying dogs as close companions sharing in the joys and challenges of family life. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok feature countless profiles dedicated to dogs, popularizing the idea that these animals are not just pets, but important members of the family circle.

In parallel, demographic shifts, such as delayed marriage and parenthood, have led many young adults to form familial bonds with pets. Dogs, in particular, fill roles traditionally reserved for children or life partners, providing companionship and a sense of purpose.

This evolution has significant implications for various industries, from veterinary care to home design, as businesses innovate to meet the needs of a growing market interested in incorporating dogs into all aspects of family life.

Relevant context: Although Frédéric Chopin never personally experienced Broadway as we know it today, since he lived in the 19th century and passed away in 1849, Broadway's impact on his music came much later, as his compositions became a source of inspiration for musical theater. Broadway, renowned as the heart of the American theatrical community, provided a platform where Chopin's music could be celebrated and enjoyed in a new context, through its integration into various musical productions.

Chopin's work, especially his expressive piano compositions, has often served as a musical foundation in Broadway productions that aim to evoke a certain emotional depth or period atmosphere. In particular, his pieces might be used as interludes or background scores to set a scene's mood or highlight a theatrical narrative's emotional arc.

Moreover, Broadway's celebratory revivals of 19th-century themes and stories sometimes incorporate Chopin’s music to lend authenticity and enhance the cultural texture. His compositions are synonymous with the Romantic era, a time often romanticized in theatrical productions as well. Additionally, his music has served as source material for jazz adaptations, a genre deeply embedded in Broadway music history, further showcasing Chopin's enduring influence on the arts.

In summary, while Chopin never directly interacted with Broadway, the legendary theater district has provided a stage to reinterpret and celebrate his music, enabling it to reach new audiences and continue its influence on the theatrical arts.

"Lateral-cut disc records were developed in the United States by Emile Berliner, who named his system the ""gramophone"", distinguishing it from Edison's wax cylinder ""phonograph"" and Columbia's wax cylinder ""graphophone"". Berliner's earliest discs, first marketed in 1889, but only in Europe, were 5 inches (13 cm) in diameter, and were played with a small hand-propelled machine. Both the records and the machine were adequate only for use as a toy or curiosity, due to the limited sound quality. In the United States in 1894, under the Berliner Gramophone trademark, Berliner started marketing records with somewhat more substantial entertainment value, along with somewhat more substantial gramophones to play them. Berliner's records had poor sound quality compared to wax cylinders, but his manufacturing associate Eldridge R. Johnson eventually improved the sound quality. Abandoning Berliner's ""Gramophone"" trademark for legal reasons, in 1901 Johnson's and Berliner's separate companies reorganized to form the Victor Talking Machine Company, whose products would come to dominate the market for many years.

There is a dedicated museum in Montreal for Berliner.",What is the name of lateral cut disc records?,gramophone,1,ENTY,"What is the name of lateral cut disc records?

Relevant context: Lateral cut disc records, more commonly known as ""gramophone records"" or simply ""records,"" were a groundbreaking development in the history of sound recording and playback. These records are characterized by grooves that are cut laterally, or side to side, into the surface of a disc. Unlike the earlier vertical cut records, also known as ""hill-and-dale"" records, where the grooves are cut up and down, lateral cut discs offered improved sound quality and were more durable.

Introduced in the early 20th century, lateral cut records became the industry standard largely due to the efforts of the Victor Talking Machine Company, which patented the technology. This method was very effective in reproducing speech and music because it better captured the nuances of sound vibrations. When these discs are played on a turntable, the stylus moves horizontally along the grooves, translating these movements into sound.

The widespread adoption of lateral cut discs marked a significant shift in the music industry, as these records facilitated mass production and distribution, making recorded music more accessible to the public. They became the most prevalent form of sound reproduction until the advent of magnetic tape and, later, digital media. Today, collectors and audiophiles still appreciate the distinctive sound quality that these analog recordings provide.

Relevant context: To explore how diseases inflict damage on the brain, researchers frequently study neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's, a progressive disorder that causes brain cells to deteriorate and die, is particularly important for understanding brain pathology because it is the most common form of dementia, affecting millions worldwide. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of plaques and tangles in the brain, which disrupt cell function and lead to a gradual decline in cognitive abilities, memory, and physical functioning.

Alzheimer's research provides critical insights into the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, including the role of proteins such as amyloid-beta and tau. Amyloid plaques, which form between neurons, and neurofibrillary tangles, which form inside neurons, are considered key markers of the disease and are central to many studies aimed at unraveling Alzheimer’s complex pathology.

In addition to Alzheimer's, other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are also studied. Parkinson's disease primarily affects movement control and leads to tremors and other motor dysfunctions, due to the death of dopamine-producing neurons in a brain region called the substantia nigra. Huntington's disease, a genetic disorder, results in the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain, affecting both physical movements and cognitive abilities.

These diseases are studied using a variety of methods, including neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and PET scans, which allow researchers to visualize structural and functional changes in the brain. Molecular studies involving post-mortem brain tissue analysis and experimental models using animals and cell cultures are also critical for understanding disease mechanisms at a cellular level.

Overall, studying these diseases not only helps us grasp the intricacies of brain damage but also aids in the development of potential treatments and interventions to slow or halt disease progression.

Among the featured unreleased tracks, ""There Must Be More to Life Than This"" stands out, a duet with the iconic Michael Jackson, alongside other gems like ""Let Me In Your Heart Again"" and ""Love Kills: The Ballad,"" a new version of Mercury's solo hit. Compiled by the band's remaining members, particularly Brian May and Roger Taylor, ""Queen Forever"" is a celebration of their enduring legacy, capturing the essence of Queen's classic sound with a fresh perspective.

The album received attention not only for its musical content but also for its presentation, being available in both a standard single-disc format and a deluxe edition with additional tracks. As a curated collection of love songs and poignant ballads, ""Queen Forever"" serves to remind both new listeners and long-time fans of the timeless nature of Queen's music, cementing their position as one of the most influential bands in rock history.",307.0,2149.0,2515,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,5.614514589309692,1.2293293476104736,7.907159805297852,Queen Forever,1.0
"The Famicom contained no lockout hardware and, as a result, unlicensed cartridges (both legitimate and bootleg) were extremely common throughout Japan and the Far East. The original NES (but not the top-loading NES-101) contained the 10NES lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers. Tinkerers at home in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip’s mode of operation from ""lock"" to ""key"", removing all effects and greatly improving the console’s ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports. NES consoles sold in different regions had different lockout chips, so games marketed in one region would not work on consoles from another region. Known regions are: USA/Canada (3193 lockout chip), most of Europe (3195), Asia (3196) and UK, Italy and Australia (3197). Since two types of lockout chip were used in Europe, European NES game boxes often had an ""A"" or ""B"" letter on the front, indicating whether the game is compatible with UK/Italian/Australian consoles (A), or the rest of Europe (B). Rest-of-Europe games typically had text on the box stating ""This game is not compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System"". Similarly, UK/Italy/Australia games stated ""This game is only compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System"".",What did the Famicom sorely lack?,lockout hardware,1,ENTY,"What did the Famicom sorely lack?

Relevant context: The Famicom, or Family Computer, was Nintendo's seminal home video game console, released in Japan in 1983. While it became incredibly popular and is often credited with revitalizing the video game industry, there were still some critical areas where the Famicom sorely lacked, particularly in comparison to later consoles and even its own contemporaries in some respects. 

Firstly, the Famicom lacked advanced graphical capabilities. It was only capable of displaying up to 52 colors, with a maximum of 25 simultaneously on screen, which was quite limited. The resolution of 256x240 pixels was adequate for the time but quickly became outdated as technology advanced. This limited the visual quality and detail of the games available on the platform.

Secondly, the Famicom did not initially support save functionality. Early Famicom cartridges lacked a battery-backed memory to save game progress. This meant players had to rely on passwords or codes, or complete games in a single sitting without turning off the console. The introduction of battery-backed cartridges came later, with games like ""The Legend of Zelda,"" but this was not a standard feature at launch.

Another area where the Famicom was lacking was its sound capabilities. The console had a basic audio output with only five sound channels, three for pulse-wave channels, one for a triangle channel, and one for noise. The sound was synthesized using a Ricoh 2A03 chip. While innovative for its time, it quickly fell short as other systems began to offer richer, more complex soundscapes. This limitation restricted the complexity and richness of the game soundtracks.

Additionally, the Famicom lacked robust multiplayer support beyond the two-player mode. While some games allowed for two players, the original Famicom design did not accommodate more without additional accessories. This limited the social potential of the console, which became a more significant selling point in later generations.

Furthermore, the Famicom, in its original design, had hardwired controllers, which meant they were not detachable or easily replaceable. Over time, this could lead to issues if the controllers became damaged or the cords frayed. The design choice was changed in later models, reflecting an early inconvenience.

Lastly, the Famicom's regional design meant that it initially could only play Japanese games. The later redesign for the Western market, known as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), included lockout chips to prevent games from other regions from being played, thus limiting its versatility compared to later consoles that became more region-friendly.

In summary, while revolutionary for its time, the Famicom faced several limitations, particularly in graphics, sound, multiplayer capabilities, game save features, controller design, and regional compatibility, which highlighted both the innovative and transitional nature of early gaming technology.",570.0,1836.0,2462,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.148172855377197,2.016876459121704,8.29633378982544,software design tools,0.0
"Synapses are the key functional elements of the brain. The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.",A synapse whose purpose is to excite the target cell are called what?,excitatory,1,ENTY,"A synapse whose purpose is to excite the target cell are called what?

Relevant context: In neuroscience, when discussing synaptic connections between neurons, we often categorize synapses based on their function in terms of the effect they have on the postsynaptic cell. A synapse whose purpose is to excite the target cell is referred to as an ""excitatory synapse."" This type of synapse is crucial in facilitating the transmission of nerve impulses across the nervous system. The key characteristic of excitatory synapses is their ability to increase the likelihood that the postsynaptic neuron will fire an action potential.

The neurotransmitters released at excitatory synapses typically bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, leading to the opening of ion channels that allow positive ions, such as sodium (Na+), to flow into the postsynaptic cell. This influx of positive ions results in depolarization of the membrane, bringing the membrane potential closer to the threshold required to trigger an action potential.

One of the most common neurotransmitters involved in excitatory synapses in the vertebrate central nervous system is glutamate. Glutamate receptors, such as AMPA and NMDA receptors, are critical for the rapid synaptic transmission and plasticity that underlie learning and memory.

In contrast to excitatory synapses, inhibitory synapses decrease the likelihood of the postsynaptic neuron reaching the threshold for an action potential. The careful balance and interaction between excitatory and inhibitory synapses are what enable the complex functioning and regulation of neural circuits in the brain.

Excitatory synapses play a vital role in various neural processes, allowing organisms to respond to stimuli, learn from experiences, and coordinate a myriad of physiological functions necessary for survival and adaptation.",349.0,1431.0,1841,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.996314525604248,1.3174021244049072,6.2927374839782715,Excitatory,1.0
"The metal's distinctive natural green patina has long been coveted by architects and designers. The final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion, thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering. It can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts, depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain. Architectural copper and its alloys can also be 'finished' to embark a particular look, feel, and/or color. Finishes include mechanical surface treatments, chemical coloring, and coatings.",What conditions effect the mixture of carbonate and sulfate in copper?,environmental,1,ENTY,"What conditions effect the mixture of carbonate and sulfate in copper?

Relevant context: When examining the mixture of carbonate and sulfate in copper, several conditions and factors come into play that significantly influence their interaction and presence in copper compounds. Understanding these conditions is crucial for applications in mineralogy, metallurgy, and materials science.

First, the **pH level** of the environment is a critical factor. Carbonate compounds tend to form in more alkaline conditions. In contrast, sulfate compounds are stable in a wider range of pH conditions but are more likely to form in neutral to acidic environments. Therefore, a more alkaline environment will favor the formation of copper carbonates such as malachite and azurite, while acidic or neutral conditions might result in the prevalence of copper sulfates such as chalcanthite.

**Temperature** is another influential factor. Higher temperatures can enhance the rate of reaction and solubility of both carbonates and sulfates. However, the solubility of carbonate compounds generally decreases with increasing temperature, whereas sulfate compounds might become more soluble, leading to different phases in the mixture.

**Availability of CO₂ and SO₄²⁻ ions** in the environment also determines the formation and stability of these compounds. In environments rich in carbon dioxide, copper carbonates are more likely to form due to the availability of carbonate ions. Conversely, in environments with a high concentration of sulfate ions, copper sulfates can precipitate more readily.

**Water presence and humidity** can greatly affect the solubility and crystallization of carbonates and sulfates. Humid conditions may support the solubilization of minerals and the growth of crystalline forms, whereas dry conditions might limit this interaction. Hydrate formation, particularly with sulfate compounds, can also occur under humid conditions, altering their stability and structure.

The **presence of other ions or elements** in the system can lead to the formation of mixed salts or complex ions. For example, the presence of additional cations like calcium or magnesium might lead to the formation of complex carbonate or sulfate minerals instead of simple copper salts. These additional elements can also lead to competitive precipitation, thereby affecting the overall composition of the mixture.

Lastly, **pressure** affects the solubility and formation conditions of these compounds. High-pressure environments, typical in geological formations, can lead to the formation of different polymorphs or structures of carbonate and sulfate minerals that would not form under standard conditions.

In laboratory settings or industrial applications, precisely controlling these parameters allows for the targeted preparation of specific copper carbonate and sulfate phases, paving the way for desired materials properties and functionalities. Understanding these conditions enables better manipulation and utilization of these minerals in industrial processes, environmental applications, and materials science research.",542.0,1593.0,2192,1.0,0.16666666666666666,0.3562071871080222,8.394997358322144,1.4344232082366943,10.75438380241394,Environmental conditions,0.8
"The rotating armature consists of one or more coils of wire wound around a laminated, magnetically ""soft"" ferromagnetic core. Current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature, making it a temporary magnet (an electromagnet). The magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding a field coil, as part of the motor frame. The force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft. The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor never stops (like a compass needle does), but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied.",Current flowing to create a temporary magent is called what?,electromagnet,1,ENTY,"Current flowing to create a temporary magent is called what?

Relevant context: The current flowing through a coil to produce a temporary magnet is called an ""electric current,"" specifically in the context of creating an electromagnet. An electromagnet is formed when a coil of wire is wound around a core, typically made of iron or another ferromagnetic material. As the electric current passes through the wire, it generates a magnetic field around the coil. This magnetic field magnetizes the core, turning the assembly into a magnet.

The magnetic field strength of an electromagnet is directly proportional to the amount of current flowing through the coil and the number of turns in the wire. When the electric current is turned off, the magnetic field collapses, and the core loses its magnetism, indicating the temporary nature of the magnet. This is in contrast to a permanent magnet, which maintains its magnetization without the need for continuous electric current.

Electromagnets are widely used in various applications, such as in electric motors, generators, magnetic locks, and certain scientific instruments, because their magnetic properties can be easily controlled by adjusting the flow of electric current. This adjustability offers significant advantages in systems where variable magnetic strength is needed.",242.0,1381.0,1681,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.343066692352295,1.2442407608032227,5.545222043991089,Electromagnet,1.0

This significant move was a part of NBC's broader strategy to refocus its business efforts and streamline its operations. RCA Records had been a prominent player in the music industry, boasting a rich history of producing numerous hit records and signing legendary artists across various genres. The label had built a reputation for its diverse catalog, which included everything from classical recordings to rock and pop hits. Prior to the sale, RCA Records had been under the ownership of General Electric, which had acquired NBC itself in that same year.

"Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease. In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a ""lawn"". The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its strain), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others, or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others. Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium. Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses: the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect, and then alter or kill. In the case of viral identification, a region of dead cells results from viral growth, and is called a ""plaque"". Eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent.",What are most pathogenic bacteria easily grown on?,nutrient agar,1,ENTY,"What are most pathogenic bacteria easily grown on?

Relevant context: Pathogenic bacteria are microorganisms that can cause disease and are of significant interest in both clinical diagnostics and research laboratories. These bacteria, to be effectively cultured and studied, require specific growth media and conditions that mimic their natural environments or provide the nutrients they need for proliferation. 

Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient-rich media that provide essential proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, salts, and other growth factors. One of the most common types of media used is nutrient agar or nutrient broth, which are general-purpose media that support the growth of a wide range of non-fastidious organisms. For more fastidious pathogens, specialized media may be used. For instance, blood agar, which incorporates red blood cells, is used for bacteria like Streptococcus species to facilitate the observation of hemolytic activity.

For Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli or Salmonella, MacConkey agar is commonly utilized. It is both selective and differential, inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive organisms while providing indicators for lactose fermentation, distinguishing between lactose-fermenting and non-fermenting bacteria.

In clinical settings, Chocolate agar, which is not made from chocolate but rather lysed red blood cells, is used for the growth of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria species. These bacteria require additional growth factors, such as NAD and hemin, present in lysed blood cells.

The conditions for growing these bacteria often involve setting the appropriate temperature, usually around 35-37 degrees Celsius, which simulates the human body temperature where many pathogenic bacteria thrive. Additionally, oxygen requirements vary among pathogens. Aerobic bacteria require oxygen to grow, anaerobic bacteria require an oxygen-free environment, and facultative anaerobes can grow in both conditions, though their growth may be enhanced or inhibited by the presence of oxygen.

Overall, the choice of medium and growth conditions are crucial for the successful cultivation and study of pathogenic bacteria, allowing researchers and clinicians to isolate and identify these potentially harmful organisms effectively.

Relevant context: The era that predated the emergence of life on Earth is known as the Hadean Eon. This period spans from the formation of the Earth around 4.6 billion years ago to approximately 4 billion years ago. The name ""Hadean"" is derived from Hades, the ancient Greek god of the underworld, reflecting the harsh and tumultuous conditions believed to have characterized early Earth. 

During the Hadean Eon, the planet was undergoing significant transformation. It was characterized by a hot, molten surface, frequent volcanic activity, and heavy bombardment from meteoroids and other celestial bodies. These conditions created an environment that was inhospitable to life as we know it today. 

Evidence suggests that during this time, the Earth was forming its primordial crust and the first oceans might have begun to appear as the surface cooled. However, the atmosphere was likely thick with volcanic gases, lacking free oxygen, thus further contributing to the uninhabitable atmospheric conditions.

Despite its hostile nature, the Hadean Eon laid down the crucial foundational elements necessary for the later development of life.

"Communication is observed within the plant organism, i.e. within plant cells and between plant cells, between plants of the same or related species, and between plants and non-plant organisms, especially in the root zone. Plant roots communicate with rhizome bacteria, fungi, and insects within the soil.

Relevant context: In the complex and intricate ecosystem that is the soil, the plant root system plays a crucial role in communicating with various organisms such as rhizome bacteria, fungi, and insects. Roots are the primary plant structures that extend into the soil, allowing plants to anchor themselves while seeking out water and essential nutrients. However, their function goes beyond simple nutrient absorption. 

Roots exude a wide range of chemical compounds, including sugars, amino acids, and organic acids, which serve as signals to the surrounding soil biota. These exudates can attract beneficial rhizosphere bacteria, which fix atmospheric nitrogen into a form that plants can use, thereby enhancing plant growth and soil fertility. For instance, in legumes, the root nodules, which house symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria like *Rhizobium*, are an excellent example of such interaction.

Moreover, roots engage in mutualistic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. In this symbiosis, the fungus enhances the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, particularly phosphorus, while receiving carbohydrates and other organic compounds from the plant in return. The root’s production of exudates and specific signaling molecules, such as strigolactones, is crucial for the colonization and development of the mycorrhizal network.

In addition to microbial organisms, plant roots also interact with various soil-dwelling insects. Some plants can release volatile organic compounds through their roots that attract beneficial predatory insects, which help in controlling herbivorous pest populations. Furthermore, roots can also signal distress when under attack, leading to the secretion of compounds that deter herbivorous insects or trigger a heightened defensive state.

Thus, the root system acts as the primary mediator in the plant-soil interface, profoundly influencing and being influenced by the microbial and insect communities in the rhizosphere. This part of the plant not only sustains the plant’s growth and survival but also manages a vast communication network essential for maintaining the health and productivity of the entire ecosystem.",423.0,1711.0,2198,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.8831870555877686,0.9801557064056396,5.781196355819702,Roots,1.0

By measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer, the index of refraction (n) and the extinction Coefficient (k) can be determined via the Forouhi-Bloomer dispersion equations. The reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension, depth, and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures.",What letter represents the extinction Coefficient?,k,1,ENTY,"What letter represents the extinction Coefficient?

Relevant context: In the realm of chemistry and biochemistry, the extinction coefficient is a crucial parameter when discussing the absorption of light by a substance in solution. It is often represented by the Greek letter epsilon (ε). The extinction coefficient provides a measure of how strongly a chemical species or a biological molecule, such as a protein or a nucleic acid, absorbs light at a given wavelength. 

When considering the Beer-Lambert Law, which is used to relate the absorption of light to the properties of the material through which the light is traveling, the extinction coefficient plays a fundamental role. The Beer-Lambert Law is usually expressed in the formula:

\[ A = εcl \]

In this equation, \( A \) is the absorbance, ε is the molar extinction coefficient (also referred to as molar absorptivity), \( c \) is the concentration of the solution in moles per liter (M), and \( l \) is the path length of the cell or cuvette that the light passes through, measured in centimeters. The extinction coefficient, ε, thus helps in understanding how much light at a specific wavelength is absorbed by a solution and is critical for determining the concentration of that solution based on measured absorbance.

This parameter is specific to each substance and depends on the wavelength of light used, typically specified in units of M⁻¹cm⁻¹ (inverse molarity times inverse centimeters). For example, many biological molecules have well-characterized extinction coefficients for wavelengths related to UV and visible light absorption, such as 280 nm for proteins or 260 nm for nucleic acids. By using these known coefficients, researchers can accurately quantify the concentrations of these molecules in complex mixtures by measuring absorbance.

Renowned public figure Virginia Woolf, known for her significant contributions to literature and her role as a central figure in the Bloomsbury Group, was deeply influenced by Jane Austen’s novels. Woolf’s profound impressions of Austen’s work were meticulously compiled into a book titled ""A Room of One’s Own and Other Impressions."" This work not only showcases Woolf’s literary criticism but also highlights her reflections on the societal and gender issues depicted in Austen’s novels. 

""A Room of One’s Own and Other Impressions"" is an exemplary compilation featuring a series of essays where Woolf delves into her impressions of influential novels and authors of her time. Her observations in this collection extend beyond mere literary critique; they offer insightful commentary on the cultural and temporal contexts in which these novels were written.

"Insects play important roles in biological research. For example, because of its small size, short generation time and high fecundity, the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a model organism for studies in the genetics of higher eukaryotes. D. melanogaster has been an essential part of studies into principles like genetic linkage, interactions between genes, chromosomal genetics, development, behavior and evolution. Because genetic systems are well conserved among eukaryotes, understanding basic cellular processes like DNA replication or transcription in fruit flies can help to understand those processes in other eukaryotes, including humans. The genome of D. melanogaster was sequenced in 2000, reflecting the organism's important role in biological research. It was found that 70% of the fly genome is similar to the human genome, supporting the evolution theory.",What percent of the fly genome is similar to the human genome,70%,1,ENTY,"What percent of the fly genome is similar to the human genome

Relevant context: In the study of genetics, scientists have long been fascinated by the vast genetic similarities between humans and other organisms, including the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Although humans and fruit flies might appear to be worlds apart, they actually share a significant amount of genetic material.

Research indicates that approximately 60% of the genes in Drosophila are conserved in humans. This means that about 60% of the fly's genes have a counterpart in the human genome with a similar sequence and function. This genetic overlap is one reason why fruit flies have been such a valuable model organism in biological research, allowing scientists to study gene function and disease.

The similarities are not limited to the coding regions of DNA but extend to some non-coding regions as well. Genes involved in basic biological processes such as development, cell division, and neural function are often highly conserved, which underscores the evolutionary genetic connections among different species.

While humans have a much larger and more complex genome, the shared genetic heritage with fruit flies highlights the common evolutionary paths that many organisms, including vertebrates and invertebrates, have undergone. This genetic similarity allows researchers to extrapolate findings from fruit flies to better understand human biology and diseases, contributing to advances in biomedical research.

"Despite their close genetic relationship and the ability to inter-breed, there are a number of diagnostic features to distinguish the gray wolves from domestic dogs. Domesticated dogs are clearly distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase. The tympanic bullae are large, convex and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled. Compared to equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls and 30% smaller brains.:35 The teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs; the premolars and molars of wolves are much less crowded and have more complex cusp patterns. Wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs, unless there has been admixture with dogs. Dogs lack a functioning pre-caudal gland, and most enter estrus twice yearly, unlike gray wolves which only do so once a year. Dogs require fewer calories to function than wolves. The dog's limp ears may be the result of atrophy of the jaw muscles. The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather.","Which typically has thicker skin, dogs or wolves?",dogs.,1,ENTY,"Which typically has thicker skin, dogs or wolves?

Relevant context: Dogs and wolves, although closely related genetically and sharing a common ancestor, exhibit several differences in their physical characteristics, including skin thickness. Typically, wolves have thicker skin compared to domestic dogs. This difference is primarily due to the distinct lifestyles and environmental adaptations of the two species.

Wolves are wild animals that have evolved to thrive in diverse and often harsh environments, ranging from the Arctic tundra to dense forests. Their thicker skin serves as a protective barrier against the elements, such as extreme cold temperatures, rough terrain, and potential injuries during hunting or encounters with other predators. The thicker dermal layer, combined with their dense fur, provides insulation and helps retain heat, which is crucial for survival in cold climates.

In contrast, domestic dogs have been bred over thousands of years for a variety of purposes, including companionship, work, and specific tasks or appearances. This long history of selective breeding has resulted in a wide array of dog breeds with varying skin thicknesses, but generally speaking, most domestic dogs have thinner skin compared to wolves. The need for a thick protective layer is less significant for dogs, as they often live in more controlled environments and do not face the same survival challenges as their wild counterparts.

However, it is important to note that there are exceptions within different breeds of dogs. For example, breeds specifically bred for cold climates or as working dogs, such as the Siberian Husky or Alaskan Malamute, often have thicker skin and fur than breeds developed for temperate or hot climates.

Overall, while there is variation among different dog breeds, wolves consistently have thicker skin as a necessity for their survival in the wild.

"In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.",What is the first step in the human digestive system?,the action of mastication (chewing),1,ENTY,"What is the first step in the human digestive system?

Relevant context: The first step in the human digestive system begins in the mouth, where the process of digestion is initiated. This stage is known as ingestion, where food is taken into the body through the oral cavity. When food enters the mouth, it is subjected to both mechanical and chemical digestion.

Mechanical digestion occurs as the teeth perform the vital function of breaking down food into smaller, more manageable pieces through the process of chewing or mastication. This physical breakdown increases the surface area of the food, making it easier for enzymes to have an effect.

Simultaneously, chemical digestion begins as the salivary glands secrete saliva. Saliva, which is composed primarily of water, also contains important enzymes and other substances, including salivary amylase, an enzyme that starts breaking down carbohydrates into simpler sugars. This enzymatic process further reduces the complexity of the nutritional molecules, preparing them for subsequent stages of digestion in the gastrointestinal tract.

The tongue, an essential muscular organ, assists in manipulating the food, mixing it thoroughly with saliva to form a cohesive and swallowable mass known as the bolus. The tongue also plays a role in tasting the food, which helps in the stimulation of other digestive processes through neural feedback mechanisms.

Thus, the first step in the digestive process encompasses several coordinated activities in the mouth that prepare the food for its journey through the digestive system. By enabling both mechanical and chemical digestion at the outset, the body efficiently sets the stage for the extraction of nutrients and energy necessary for maintaining bodily functions.",315.0,1642.0,2018,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,4.331982851028442,1.1416089534759521,6.510319471359253,Mastication (chewing),0.8
"Hemimetabolous insects, those with incomplete metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing a series of molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.:142",Incomplete metamorphosis insects are called?,Hemimetabolous,1,ENTY,"Incomplete metamorphosis insects are called?

Relevant context: Incomplete metamorphosis insects are referred to as ""hemimetabolous"" insects. Unlike their counterparts that undergo complete metamorphosis, known as ""holometabolous"" insects, hemimetabolous insects experience a three-stage life cycle consisting of the egg, nymph, and adult stages, lacking a distinct pupal stage. 

This type of development is characteristic of several orders of insects, including Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets), Hemiptera (true bugs), and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies). In these insects, the young, called nymphs, generally resemble the adults but are smaller, lack fully developed wings, and are often sexually immature. As nymphs grow, they undergo a series of molts, gradually acquiring adult features, such as fully developed wings and reproductive organs.

Incomplete metamorphosis is advantageous in stable environments where juvenile and adult insects can occupy similar niches and exploit similar resources. This life cycle allows for a relatively straightforward progression to maturity without the drastic changes seen in insects undergoing complete metamorphosis.

"Color in glass may be obtained by addition of electrically charged ions (or color centers) that are homogeneously distributed, and by precipitation of finely dispersed particles (such as in photochromic glasses). Ordinary soda-lime glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further FeO and Cr2O3 additions may be used for the production of green bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere. Manganese dioxide can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron(II) oxide. When used in art glass or studio glass is colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and 'cook' times. Most colored glass used in the art market is manufactured in volume by vendors who serve this market although there are some glassmakers with the ability to make their own color from raw materials.",What can prevent a green color in glass?,Manganese dioxide,1,ENTY,"What can prevent a green color in glass?

Relevant context: Glass typically acquires a green tint due to the presence of iron impurities, which are naturally found in the raw materials used in glass production, such as sand or recycled glass. To prevent this green coloration, manufacturers can take several approaches, ranging from material selection to chemical treatment.

Firstly, choosing raw materials with low iron content is one of the fundamental steps in preventing a green tint. For instance, using high-purity silica sand that contains minimal iron impurities can significantly diminish the green hue in the final product. However, this approach can be costly, as purer raw materials are generally more expensive.

Another common method is the addition of decolorizing agents during the glass-making process. One of the most effective decolorizers is manganese dioxide, which acts by oxidizing iron from its green-tinted ferrous state to a nearly colorless ferric state. Alternatively, selenium compounds can be added to offset the green tint by imparting a pinkish hue that balances the coloration, resulting in clear glass. Similarly, cerium oxide can be used both as a decolorizer and as a UV blocker, providing an added benefit.

Additionally, special techniques in the manufacturing process can help minimize the presence of iron. For instance, careful control of the furnace atmosphere and temperature can influence the oxidation state of iron, reducing its impact on the glass color when properly managed.

Recycling practices can also be adjusted to prevent green coloration, as recycled glass, known as cullet, often contributes to increased iron content. By sorting cullet by color and limiting the use of green glass scrap, manufacturers can better control the color of the final product.

In summary, preventing a green color in glass involves a combination of high-purity material selection, chemical additives like manganese dioxide or selenium compounds, and meticulous control of the manufacturing process. By employing these strategies, manufacturers can produce clear or differently colored glass that meets specific aesthetic and functional requirements.",394.0,1978.0,2428,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.768611669540405,1.1648831367492676,9.892064332962036,Manganese dioxide,1.0

Unlike other digital pets that primarily centered on nurturing and caring for the creatures, Digimon emphasized training and evolving monsters to compete in battles against other Digimon. This competitive aspect introduced an engaging layer of strategy and interaction that appealed to a different audience. Each Digimon could ""digivolve"" into a more powerful form based on training and care, adding a focus on growth and development beyond mere maintenance of the pet's well-being.

Additionally, Digimon had a connectivity feature that allowed two devices to link together, enabling direct battles between players' creatures. This social component encouraged direct player interaction, setting it apart from more solitary digital pet experiences. The outcome of battles could affect the Digimon's ability to evolve and grow, adding stakes to the training and maintenance process.

Furthermore, Digimon expanded beyond the handheld devices into a multimedia franchise, which included anime series, movies, video games, and trading card games. The anime, which depicted a group of children transported to a digital world where they teamed up with Digimon partners to save both the digital and real worlds, was particularly influential in establishing a rich narrative universe. This expansive storytelling helped reinforce and expand the digital pet concept into a larger mythos, something that similar products at the time did not achieve to the same extent.

While both Digimon and its competitors like Tamagotchi focused on digital creatures, Digimon’s emphasis on battling, evolution, social interaction through connectivity, and narrative expansion through multimedia made it stand out as a unique incarnation of digital pets that merged virtual pet care with robust interactive and story-driven experiences.",419.0,2088.0,2562,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.601996898651123,1.047417402267456,6.647443056106567,Battles,0.5
"Many arrangements of electrical contacts are used. Large lamps may have a screw base (one or more contacts at the tip, one at the shell) or a bayonet base (one or more contacts on the base, shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support). Some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either end. Miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts, and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires. Contacts in the lamp socket allow the electric current to pass through the base to the filament. Power ratings for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts.",What is the name for a lamp base with one or more contacts on the base and a shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support?,bayonet base,1,ENTY,"What is the name for a lamp base with one or more contacts on the base and a shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support?

Relevant context: In the world of lighting and electrical fixtures, there are various types of lamp bases, each designed for specific purposes and applications. One such type is the ""Edison screw base,"" which is the most commonly used lamp base worldwide for household lighting. Specifically, when discussing a lamp base that has one or more contacts at its base and a shell that can function as a contact or merely as mechanical support, we are referring to the ""screw base.""

The Edison screw base is characterized by its thread-like metal shell, which screws into a matching socket to hold the bulb securely. This design not only provides mechanical support, ensuring that the bulb stays firmly in place but also serves as an electrical contact point. The shell itself is a conductor, typically connected to the neutral side of the electrical circuit, while an additional contact point at the base of the bulb provides the live connection needed to energize the filament or LED circuit.

The most prevalent size of the Edison screw base is known as the E26 or E27, depending on regional standards, with the former being more common in North America and the latter in Europe. These sizes refer to the diameter of the base in millimeters. However, the Edison screw base family includes a range of sizes, such as E12, E14 (commonly used for smaller bulbs or decorative lighting), and E39 (used for industrial or high-intensity applications).

The design of the Edison screw base allows for simplicity and reliability, making it a popular choice not only for its versatility in different lamp styles but also for its ease of installation and replacement. This type of base is widely used in a variety of applications, from residential lighting fixtures to streetlights, thereby demonstrating its adaptability.

In summary, the Edison screw base, or sometimes simply referred to as a ""screw base,"" is a fundamental component in modern lighting. Its unique structure, where the shell acts as a contact or mechanical support, is integral to its function and widespread use. This makes it a highly relevant subject for understanding lighting technologies and the development of compatible lighting solutions.",447.0,1454.0,1978,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.378167152404785,0.9691054821014404,7.316991567611694,Bayonet base,1.0

"As the playing of gramophone records causes gradual degradation of the recording, they are best preserved by transferring them onto other media and playing the records as rarely as possible. They need to be stored on edge, and do best under environmental conditions that most humans would find comfortable. The medium needs to be kept clean, but alcohol should only be used on PVC or optical media, not on 78s.[citation needed] The equipment for playback of certain formats (e.g., 16 and 78 rpm) is manufactured only in small quantities, leading to increased difficulty in finding equipment to play the recordings.",Should alcohol be used to clean gramophone recordings?,alcohol should only be used on PVC or optical media,1,ENTY,"Should alcohol be used to clean gramophone recordings?

Relevant context: When considering whether to use alcohol to clean gramophone recordings, it's important to understand the materials and the risks involved. Gramophone records, particularly the older shellac 78 RPM records, are quite different from the vinyl records that became popular in later decades.

Shellac records are made from a natural resin and are quite fragile; therefore, they do not react well to alcohol-based cleaning solutions. Alcohol can cause damage to the shellac surface by creating a milky haze or causing the material to become brittle and crack. Vinyl records are more tolerant of different cleaning methods, but even with vinyl, there are considerations regarding the use of alcohol.

For vinyl records, mild solutions of isopropyl alcohol mixed with distilled water are sometimes used because alcohol can effectively dissolve oils and other oily residues. However, some audiophiles argue that alcohol can strip the protective plasticizers from vinyl, potentially harming the sound quality over time, and should thus be used sparingly, if at all.

Instead of alcohol, a safer approach for both shellac and vinyl records involves using a specialized record cleaning solution or distilled water with a few drops of a gentle, non-ionic detergent. Applying this solution with a soft microfiber cloth or a carbon fiber brush can effectively clean the records without risking damage.

For those handling vintage gramophone recordings, particularly shellac-based ones, using alcohol is not recommended due to the potential for irreversible damage. Preservation often involves avoiding harsh chemicals, maintaining proper storage conditions, and using suitable cleaning materials that do not compromise the integrity of the recording. 

In conclusion, while vinyl records might tolerate small amounts of isopropyl alcohol in a diluted form, it's generally best practice to use designated record cleaning fluids that are designed to both preserve and clean without risk. For shellac records, avoid alcohol entirely and opt for safer cleaning methods. Given the value and often irreplaceable nature of these recordings, it's worth investing in the right tools and solutions to ensure their longevity.",406.0,1800.0,2260,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.041326522827148,0.9796142578125,6.146593809127808,No,0.0
"By 1939, in his Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare, McKerrow had changed his mind about this approach, as he feared that a later edition – even if it contained authorial corrections – would ""deviate more widely than the earliest print from the author's original manuscript."" He therefore concluded that the correct procedure would be ""produced by using the earliest ""good"" print as copy-text and inserting into it, from the first edition which contains them, such corrections as appear to us to be derived from the author."" But, fearing the arbitrary exercise of editorial judgment, McKerrow stated that, having concluded that a later edition had substantive revisions attributable to the author, ""we must accept all the alterations of that edition, saving any which seem obvious blunders or misprints.""",What work was the first to see McKerrow use his new method?,Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare,1,ENTY,"What work was the first to see McKerrow use his new method?

Relevant context: Ronald B. McKerrow, a notable figure in the field of bibliography and textual criticism, is best known for his innovative approaches to textual editing. The first work where McKerrow applied his new method was his 1904 edition of Thomas Nashe's works, specifically titled ""The Works of Thomas Nashe"". McKerrow's method involved a meticulous comparison of various editions and manuscripts of Nashe's texts, combined with a systematic approach to textual variants and annotations.

In this edition, McKerrow deployed his method of ""analytical bibliography,"" which focused on understanding and reconstructing the textual history of Nashe's writings. His approach included examining the printing processes used during Nashe's time, identifying typographical errors and variants, and assessing the bibliographical evidence to develop a more authentic and reliable text. McKerrow's work on Nashe not only provided a new standard for future bibliographical studies but also had a significant impact on the field of textual criticism by introducing a more scientific and methodical framework for editing historical texts.

This edition of Nashe's works was highly influential and is frequently cited as a seminal text in the study of English Renaissance literature. It set the stage for McKerrow's later contributions to bibliography, including his development of bibliographical tools and resources that are still used by scholars today.

"Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16 and the now-obsolete UCS-2. UTF-8 uses one byte for any ASCII character, all of which have the same code values in both UTF-8 and ASCII encoding, and up to four bytes for other characters. UCS-2 uses a 16-bit code unit (two 8-bit bytes) for each character but cannot encode every character in the current Unicode standard. UTF-16 extends UCS-2, using one 16-bit unit for the characters that were representable in UCS-2 and two 16-bit units (4 × 8 bits) to handle each of the additional characters.",What type of code does UCS-2 use?,16-bit code unit,1,ENTY,"What type of code does UCS-2 use?

Relevant context: UCS-2, or Universal Character Set 2-byte, is a character encoding standard that was originally developed as part of the ISO/IEC 10646 standard. It uses a fixed-length 16-bit code unit to represent each character. This means that each character in UCS-2 is encoded using 2 bytes (16 bits), allowing for 65,536 possible unique code points. 

The design of UCS-2 was aligned with the early Unicode standard, which sought to accommodate characters from most of the world's writing systems within a single uniform code space. Originally, the 16-bit code space of UCS-2 was deemed sufficient to cover all necessary characters, including those from major world languages and additional symbols.

However, UCS-2 does not support characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), which are those characters assigned code points in the range from U+0000 to U+FFFF. This limitation arises because UCS-2 lacks a mechanism for representing the supplementary characters found in what are termed the supplementary planes (planes 1 through 16 in Unicode, with code points from U+10000 to U+10FFFF). Consequently, UCS-2 cannot encode many historic scripts, additional emoji, and other characters added in later versions of Unicode.

To address these limitations, Unicode evolved to adopt UTF-16, an extension of UCS-2, which retains compatibility with UCS-2 for BMP characters but also introduces a system of surrogate pairs. This extension allows UTF-16 to represent characters outside of the BMP by using 32 bits (two 16-bit code units) for those supplementary characters, thus dramatically expanding the number of possible characters beyond the 65,536 limit of UCS-2.

In summary, UCS-2 employs a fixed two-byte (16-bit) code unit system, which restricts it to encoding characters only within the Basic Multilingual Plane of Unicode. While it laid an important foundation for software globalization, it has largely been supplanted by UTF-16 due to the growing need to represent a broader range of characters.",424.0,1608.0,2087,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.119140625,0.9600653648376465,6.04525899887085,16-bit,0.8
"A molecular form called protonated molecular hydrogen (H+
3) is found in the interstellar medium, where it is generated by ionization of molecular hydrogen from cosmic rays. This charged ion has also been observed in the upper atmosphere of the planet Jupiter. The ion is relatively stable in the environment of outer space due to the low temperature and density. H+
3 is one of the most abundant ions in the Universe, and it plays a notable role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium. Neutral triatomic hydrogen H3 can only exist in an excited form and is unstable. By contrast, the positive hydrogen molecular ion (H+
2) is a rare molecule in the universe.",In what way can Neutral triatomic hydrogen exist?,excited form,1,ENTY,"In what way can Neutral triatomic hydrogen exist?

Relevant context: Neutral triatomic hydrogen, often symbolized as \(\text{H}_3\), is an intriguing species within the field of molecular chemistry. In neutral form, triatomic hydrogen is highly unstable due to the nature of hydrogen's bonding capabilities and tends to be transient and challenging to isolate or observe directly under normal conditions. However, it can exist in a few specific forms or environments.

One potential form of neutral \(\text{H}_3\) is through its association with high-energy environments, such as those found in interstellar space or during certain types of laboratory experiments where energy levels are high enough to overcome potential energy barriers. In these environments, neutral \(\text{H}_3\) can exist momentarily as a fleeting species during chemical reactions and is usually detected by spectroscopic methods that capture its transient presence.

Structurally, \(\text{H}_3\) could exist as an equilateral triangular configuration with all hydrogen atoms symmetrically arranged; however, due to lack of electron-energy stabilization, this form is not stable under typical Earth conditions. It may briefly form as a transition state in certain chemical reactions, particularly those involving electron bombardment or the dissociation and recombination of molecular hydrogen \((\text{H}_2)\).

Furthermore, in quantum chemistry, researchers use advanced computational models to study the existence of neutral \(\text{H}_3\), predicting its potential energy surfaces and electronic states. These studies suggest that while the neutral \(\text{H}_3\) is a theoretical interest, its practical isolation remains problematic due to its high reactivity and tendency to decompose into more stable species like \(\text{H}_2\) and atomic hydrogen (H).

In summary, while neutral triatomic hydrogen is not a stable molecule that can be easily isolated, it can theoretically exist in high-energy conditions, transiently during reactions, and is often a subject of theoretical and computational chemistry studies to understand the fundamental interactions and potential energy dynamics within molecules. The pursuit of understanding \(\text{H}_3\) allows chemists and physicists to gain deeper insights into molecular bonding, electron interactions, and the behavior of hydrogen in various states, contributing to broader knowledge in material science and astrophysics.",466.0,1546.0,2068,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.728500604629517,1.1772947311401367,10.014771223068237,Excited form,0.9

Relevant context: One common configuration in which a capacitor may have its connecting leads organized is the ""axial lead"" arrangement. In this configuration, the leads extend from each end of the cylindrical body of the capacitor, aligned along the axis of the cylinder. This design allows for easy mounting in circuits where space is constrained and components are arranged in a linear fashion on the circuit board. The axial lead design facilitates straightforward insertion into through-holes in a printed circuit board (PCB), making it particularly suitable for use in applications where the component must lie flat against the board surface.

Axial leaded capacitors are often utilized in applications where mechanical robustness and secure mounting are essential. This arrangement provides good mechanical stability and resistance to vibration, due to the leads forming a firm anchoring structure once soldered in place. Additionally, the axial lead configuration allows for easy heat dissipation, as both ends of the component are free to radiate heat away from the capacitor body.

These capacitors are commonly found in power supply circuits, where their role is to smooth out voltage fluctuations. They are also used in filtering applications in electronic devices to remove noise from signals. Axial capacitors are available in a wide range of capacitance values and voltage ratings, catering to diverse application needs.

This era marked a significant transformation in the art form, moving from scattered instances of cartoon narratives to a booming industry that captured the imagination of readers around the world.

The early 20th century saw the emergence of comic strips in newspapers, particularly in the United States. Iconic characters like the ""Yellow Kid,"" who debuted in 1895, laid the groundwork for what would become a beloved medium by introducing the concept of serialized storytelling through sequential art. As the century progressed, the 1930s brought about the Golden Age of Comic Books, highlighted by the publication of ""Action Comics #1"" in 1938, which introduced Superman, one of the first superhero legends.

This period saw a tremendous increase in the production and popularity of comic books. Publishers such as DC Comics and Marvel Comics (then known as Timely Comics) became powerhouses in the industry, creating a variety of superheroes that would become cultural icons. The medium wasn't limited to superheroes, however. Comic books explored diverse genres, including romance, horror, science fiction, and westerns, catering to a wide range of interests.

The mid-20th century continued this proliferation, with comics adapting to the societal shifts and challenges of the time, such as during World War II, when they served as both entertainment and morale boosters, and into the post-war era, where they were scrutinized during the Comics Code Authority implementation in the 1950s. Despite this, comics adapted and thrived, with the Silver Age in the 1960s bringing a renewed creative energy and more complex, relatable characters.

"The scope of the term ""post-punk"" has been subject to controversy. While some critics, such as AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, have employed the term ""post-punk"" to denote ""a more adventurous and arty form of punk"", others have suggested it pertains to a set of artistic sensibilities and approaches rather than any unifying style. Music journalist and post-punk scholar Simon Reynolds has advocated that post-punk be conceived as ""less a genre of music than a space of possibility"", suggesting that ""what unites all this activity is a set of open-ended imperatives: innovation; willful oddness; the willful jettisoning of all things precedented or 'rock'n'roll'"".

Relevant context: In the ever-evolving landscape of music genres, post-punk emerged in the late 1970s as an innovative and transformative movement that pushed the boundaries of the original punk rock ethos. One authoritative voice that encapsulated the essence of post-punk was music journalist Simon Reynolds. Reynolds is widely recognized for his insightful analyses of various music genres and movements.

In his influential book ""Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984,"" Reynolds described post-punk as ""a more adventurous and arty form of punk."" This characterization captures the genre's spirit of experimentation and artistic ambition that differentiated it from its predecessor. Whereas punk rock was known for its raw energy, simplicity, and rebellious attitude, post-punk artists sought to stretch the musical and thematic limits of punk by incorporating diverse influences—ranging from electronic and dance music to avant-garde art and literature.

Reynolds' description highlights the intellectual and artistic dimensions that post-punk artists embraced, allowing them to explore complex themes and innovative musical techniques. Bands such as Joy Division, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Talking Heads exemplified this shift, blending introspective and philosophical lyrics with unconventional sounds and experimental production methods.

By positioning post-punk as ""more adventurous and arty,"" Reynolds effectively articulated how this genre embodied a quest for new possibilities within rock music, establishing a legacy that would influence countless subsequent musical movements.

According to Ben Detrick of XXL magazine, West effectively led a new wave of artists, including Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, and Drake, who lacked the interest or ability to rap about gunplay or drug-dealing.",Who did Kanye West have a sales competition with during his album release of Graduation?,50 Cent,1,HUM,"Who did Kanye West have a sales competition with during his album release of Graduation?

Relevant context: During the release of his third studio album, ""Graduation,"" on September 11, 2007, Kanye West found himself in a highly publicized sales competition with another prominent rapper, Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson. This head-to-head contest captured the attention of both media and fans, marking a significant moment in music history.

The rivalry was spurred by the simultaneous release of 50 Cent's third studio album, ""Curtis,"" on the same day as ""Graduation."" The clash was framed as a battle between different schools of hip-hop: Kanye West's more introspective, experimental style versus 50 Cent’s gritty, street-oriented themes. Both artists engaged in playful banter and self-promotion leading up to the release date, with 50 Cent famously declaring that he would retire from solo albums if Kanye outsold him.

In the weeks leading up to September 11, both Kanye and 50 Cent utilized media outlets extensively to promote their albums, taking part in joint interviews and appearing on magazine covers such as Rolling Stone, which further amplified the competitive narrative. The public, captivated by the spectacle, eagerly anticipated the outcome, and the debate over who would emerge victorious fueled discussions across social media and music forums.

When the first-week sales were finally tallied, Kanye West's ""Graduation"" outsold 50 Cent's ""Curtis"" by a significant margin.

Relevant context: During the era of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), film production was tightly controlled by the state, with the primary authority being the Ministry of Culture. This governmental body oversaw the entire cultural landscape of the GDR, including its film industry. Within the Ministry, the main organization responsible for film production was DEFA (Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft), which was established in 1946 and held a monopoly over film production in East Germany.

DEFA was responsible for producing, distributing, and exhibiting films within the GDR. It operated several studios and had divisions dedicated to feature films, documentaries, animations, and newsreels. DEFA's operations were carried out under strict state supervision to ensure that all films aligned with socialist ideals and propaganda goals. This meant that scripts and completed films had to undergo rigorous censorship processes, with the authorities scrutinizing content for any deviation from the state-sanctioned narrative.

Furthermore, the Politbüro of the Socialist Unity Party (SED), the leading political authority in the GDR, wielded significant influence over cultural policies and priorities. Decisions about which films to produce or censor were often made based on the opinions of SED leaders. Production was also influenced by international agreements within the Eastern Bloc; for instance, co-productions with other socialist countries were encouraged.

Overall, film production in the GDR was a state-controlled enterprise, reflecting the broader socialist command economy and ideological control exerted by the ruling party over all aspects of cultural life.

"At least where the digital audio tracks were concerned, the sound quality was unsurpassed at the time compared to consumer videotape, but the quality of the analog soundtracks varied greatly depending on the disc and, sometimes, the player. Many early and lower-end LD players had poor analog audio components, and many early discs had poorly mastered analog audio tracks, making digital soundtracks in any form most desirable to serious enthusiasts. Early DiscoVision and LaserDisc titles lacked the digital audio option, but many of those movies received digital sound in later re-issues by Universal, and the quality of analog audio tracks generally got far better as time went on.

Later analog discs also applied CX Noise Reduction, which improved the signal-noise ratio of their audio.",Was sound quality from disc to disc and between players consistent or varied?,varied greatly,1,HUM,"Was sound quality from disc to disc and between players consistent or varied?

Relevant context: In the early days of recorded music, sound quality could vary significantly from disc to disc and between different playback devices. Several factors contributed to these inconsistencies.

Firstly, the manufacturing process for records was not as standardized as it is today. Early records were often made using a variety of materials and techniques. For example, shellac, which was commonly used before the advent of vinyl, could introduce noise and variability in sound quality due to its uneven surface quality and fragility. Additionally, the quality of the original recording—often limited by the acoustical or electrical recording equipment available at the time—played a significant role in determining the final sound quality of a disc.

Further contributing to the variability was the physical condition of the discs. Records were susceptible to wear and tear from repeated playback, and even minor scratches or dust could significantly affect playback quality. Differences in the precision of the grooves and the depth of cutting during the manufacturing process could also result in noticeable differences in sound fidelity and clarity from one disc to another.

On the playback side, phonograph players showed a wide range of performance capabilities. Variances in the quality of the needle, the mechanical condition of the player, the quality of the amplifier, and the design of the speaker system all influenced sound reproduction. Early mechanical players, for instance, lacked electronic amplification, relying instead on acoustic horns that could distort sound. As technology advanced, electronic players with more precise needles, better amplification systems, and stereo sound became more common, providing a clearer and more consistent listening experience. However, even among these more advanced devices, differences in build quality and design affected consistency. 

Moreover, the setup environment, including factors such as room acoustics and speaker positioning, could further alter the listening experience from one playback session to another. Users who invested in high-quality equipment and maintained their discs well generally enjoyed more consistent sound.

In summary, while advances have led to more standardized and consistent sound quality over the years, early recorded music was often marked by noticeable variability due to a combination of recording, manufacturing, and playback factors. These variations required listeners to not only select discs with care but also invest in higher-quality playback equipment to achieve the best possible sound experience.",454.0,1662.0,2175,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.8259007930755615,1.085221290588379,7.778194189071655,Varied,0.8

Osler applied Ehrlich's staining methods in his studies of blood diseases, particularly in understanding anemias and leukemias. By using these techniques, he was able to differentiate between different types of white blood cells, which was crucial in diagnosing and treating hematological conditions.

Another researcher inspired by Ehrlich's stains was Santiago Ramón y Cajal, a Spanish neuroscientist hailed as the father of modern neuroscience. Cajal adapted Ehrlich's staining methods to develop his own ""black reaction"" (Golgi stain), which allowed him to visualize the intricate networks of neurons in unprecedented detail. This work earned him a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906, and it revolutionized the understanding of the structure and function of the nervous system.

Nobel laureate Paul Karrer, known for his work on the synthesis of vitamins, also relied on staining methods influenced by Ehrlich to investigate the structures and functions of various biochemical compounds in cells. Similarly, bacteriologist Hans Christian Gram, although more famously known for developing the Gram stain, was influenced by Ehrlich's methods to refine his own techniques for differentiating bacterial species.

Overall, Ehrlich's innovations in stains set a significant precedent that was instrumental in the development of cellular biology, pathology, and by extension, many advances in medical science. His influence is seen in the myriad of researchers across different fields who adopted and adapted his techniques to further their investigations into the intricacies of biology and medicine.",428.0,1617.0,2104,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.937298536300659,1.5014853477478027,7.635429382324219,Camillo Golgi,0.0

"In The Madonna Companion biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that more than any other recent pop artist, Madonna had used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work. According to them, many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context, while referring to the music. Cultural critic Mark C. Taylor in his book Nots (1993) felt that the postmodern art form par excellence is video and the reigning ""queen of video"" is Madonna. He further asserted that ""the most remarkable creation of MTV is Madonna. The responses to Madonna's excessively provocative videos have been predictably contradictory."" The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as ""Papa Don't Preach"", ""Like a Prayer"", or ""Justify My Love"" had to do with the music videos created to promote the songs and their impact, rather than the songs themselves. Morton felt that ""artistically, Madonna's songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos.""",The most remarkable creation in MTV is whom?,Madonna,1,HUM,"The most remarkable creation in MTV is whom?

Relevant context: When discussing the most remarkable creation in MTV's history, few names stand out as boldly or as persistently as that of Michael Jackson. While many artists have graced the channel, Jackson's impact on MTV and the music industry is unparalleled, making him a central figure in the evolution of both.

Michael Jackson's relationship with MTV began to redefine the landscape of music television. Prior to Jackson, MTV primarily featured rock-oriented artists, and its influence was largely confined to that genre. However, 1983 marked a definitive moment with the release of Jackson's ""Thriller"" music video. Directed by John Landis, this short film revolutionized how music videos were perceived—transforming them from mere promotional tools into a compelling art form. The video for ""Thriller"" was a cultural phenomenon; its theatrical horror theme, groundbreaking choreography, and narrative depth distinguished it from other MUSIC VIDEOs of the time. 

Jackson's earlier videos, such as ""Billie Jean"" and ""Beat It,"" also played crucial roles in breaking racial barriers on MTV, which initially faced criticism for lacking diversity. His presence on the network opened doors for other African American artists, paving the way for a more inclusive range of music genres and performers to access MTV's vast audience. 

MTV's creation of the ""MTV Video Music Awards"" in 1984 further cemented Jackson’s influence. His performances, such as the unforgettable ""Moonwalk"" during ""Billie Jean"" at Motown 25, captured global attention and demonstrated the power of live televised performances. These appearances not only garnered high ratings for MTV but also established Jackson as an iconic performer whose influence transcended music.

Jackson's innovative approach and artistic expression left an indelible mark on MTV, transforming it into a cultural powerhouse. It is for these reasons that many regard Michael Jackson as MTV's most remarkable creation, not merely as a musical legend but as a transformative figure who reshaped the potential and power of music television.",408.0,1482.0,1944,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.315149307250977,0.977297306060791,7.443378448486328,Madonna,1.0

"The use of animal fur in clothing dates to prehistoric times. It is currently associated in developed countries with expensive, designer clothing, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection. Once uncontroversial, it has recently been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. PETA, along with other animal rights and animal liberation groups have called attention to fur farming and other practices they consider cruel.",Who considers animal fur to be cruel and unnecessary?,campaigners,1,HUM,"Who considers animal fur to be cruel and unnecessary?

Relevant context: There is a significant portion of the global population that considers the use of animal fur to be cruel and unnecessary. This perspective is primarily held by animal rights organizations, environmentalists, and a growing number of fashion designers and consumers. Organizations such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and the Humane Society International are at the forefront of campaigns against the fur industry. They argue that the process of obtaining animal fur involves inhumane practices, including trapping, confinement, and killing of animals solely for their pelts.

The empathy for animal welfare is a fundamental reason for the anti-fur stance. Advocates assert that technological advances have made it possible to produce high-quality faux fur, making the use of real fur outdated and irrelevant. These synthetic alternatives are not only cruelty-free but also more sustainable, as they do not contribute to the environmental damage associated with animal farming and deforestation.

Furthermore, many high-profile fashion designers and brands have taken a stand against fur. Iconic labels like Gucci, Prada, Giorgio Armani, Burberry, and Chanel have announced fur-free policies, aligning themselves with ethical and environmental concerns. These decisions are often driven by changing consumer attitudes, as a younger generation of buyers is increasingly concerned with ethical sourcing and environmental responsibility.

Public opinion surveys and market research also reflect this shift, indicating that a growing number of consumers prefer sustainable and ethical products, steering the fashion industry towards more compassionate practices. In essence, those who consider animal fur to be cruel and unnecessary believe that ethical and environmentally conscious options are readily available, making fur obsolete in modern fashion.",327.0,1228.0,1610,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.777618885040283,8.683180809020996,16.180471658706665,Campaigners,1.0
"West's fourth studio album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), marked an even more radical departure from his previous releases, largely abandoning rap and hip hop stylings in favor of a stark electropop sound composed of virtual synthesis, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, and explicitly auto-tuned vocal tracks. Drawing inspiration from artists such as Gary Numan, TJ Swan and Boy George, and maintaining a ""minimal but functional"" approach towards the album's studio production, West explored the electronic feel produced by Auto-Tune and utilized the sounds created by the 808, manipulating its pitch to produce a distorted, electronic sound; he then sought to juxtapose mechanical sounds with the traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir monks. The album's music features austere production and elements such as dense drums, lengthy strings, droning synthesizers, and somber piano, and drew comparisons to the work of 1980s post-punk and new wave groups, with West himself later confessing an affinity with British post-punk group Joy Division. Rolling Stone journalist Matthew Trammell asserted that the record was ahead of its time and wrote in a 2012 article, ""Now that popular music has finally caught up to it, 808s & Heartbreak has revealed itself to be Kanye’s most vulnerable work, and perhaps his most brilliant.""",Who did Kanye become inspired by while creating 808s & Heartbreak?,"Gary Numan, TJ Swan and Boy George",1,HUM,"Who did Kanye become inspired by while creating 808s & Heartbreak?

Relevant context: Kanye West, while crafting his groundbreaking album ""808s & Heartbreak,"" drew inspiration from a diverse range of sources, shaping a unique sound that marked a departure from his previous work. Central to his inspiration was the loss of his mother, Donda West, and the end of his engagement to Alexis Phifer, events that induced a deep emotional turmoil. This personal heartache led him to express vulnerability through stark, minimalistic beats and autotuned vocals, emphasizing feelings of loneliness and grief.

Musically, Kanye was inspired by the work of several artists and genres that expanded his creative vision. He was particularly influenced by the electronic sounds of Kraftwerk and the eclectic, avant-garde compositions of Brian Eno, which encouraged him to experiment with synthesizers and electronic drum machines. The minimalist production approach of Phil Collins and Tears for Fears also provided a sonic template for the album, inspiring Kanye to focus on emotive melodies and stripped-down instrumentation.

Furthermore, Kanye was captivated by the raw honesty and emotional depth of 1980s pop and new wave musicians, such as Depeche Mode, whose dark themes resonated with his own experiences at the time. The use of the Roland TR-808 drum machine wasn’t just a nod to hip-hop’s past but also a deliberate choice influenced by these artists, allowing him to create a cold and distant, yet deeply personal atmosphere.

In terms of contemporaries, Kanye admired Kid Cudi, who was instrumental later on, not just as a collaborator but as an influence in embracing introspective and melodic hip-hop. Kanye’s shift towards more personal and emotional content can also be seen as a response to the burgeoning indie scene, with artists like Bon Iver, whose music he later sampled, inspiring him to explore different forms of musical expression.

Kanye’s innovative blend of these inspirations culminated in an album that defied genre boundaries, setting the stage for a new wave of hip-hop and pop music. ""808s & Heartbreak"" became a pivotal album that not only reflected Kanye's personal struggles but also expanded the scope of what was possible in modern music production.",440.0,2044.0,2554,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.344913005828857,2.2118401527404785,9.652481317520142,"Gary Numan, TJ Swan, Boy George, Joy Division",0.5
"Nineteenth-century fictional depictions of John were heavily influenced by Sir Walter Scott's historical romance, Ivanhoe, which presented ""an almost totally unfavourable picture"" of the king; the work drew on Victorian histories of the period and on Shakespeare's play. Scott's work influenced the late 19th-century children's writer Howard Pyle's book The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, which in turn established John as the principal villain within the traditional Robin Hood narrative. During the 20th century, John was normally depicted in fictional books and films alongside Robin Hood. Sam De Grasse's role as John in the black-and-white 1922 film version shows John committing numerous atrocities and acts of torture. Claude Rains played John in the 1938 colour version alongside Errol Flynn, starting a trend for films to depict John as an ""effeminate ... arrogant and cowardly stay-at-home"". The character of John acts either to highlight the virtues of King Richard, or contrasts with the Sheriff of Nottingham, who is usually the ""swashbuckling villain"" opposing Robin. An extreme version of this trend can be seen in the Disney cartoon version, for example, which depicts John, voiced by Peter Ustinov, as a ""cowardly, thumbsucking lion"". Popular works that depict John beyond the Robin Hood legends, such as James Goldman's play and later film, The Lion in Winter, set in 1183, commonly present him as an ""effete weakling"", in this instance contrasted with the more masculine Henry II, or as a tyrant, as in A. A. Milne's poem for children, ""King John's Christmas"".",Who was John depicted alongside?,Robin Hood,1,HUM,"Who was John depicted alongside?

Relevant context: In the famous painting ""The Last Supper"" by Leonardo da Vinci, John is depicted alongside Jesus Christ at the center of the composition. The artwork, completed in the late 15th century, presents a scene from the Bible where Jesus announces that one of the Apostles will betray him. John, often referred to as the beloved disciple, is shown sitting to the right of Jesus. He is characterized by youthful and gentle features, distinguishing him from the other, older-looking apostles. 

To Jesus' left is Peter, depicted with a robust appearance, and behind John, Judas Iscariot can be seen clutching a small bag, a traditional symbol of his betrayal for thirty pieces of silver. The dynamic interplay between these figures creates an intense yet harmonious scene. Notably, John is also depicted in Leonardo's narrative as composed and seemingly peaceful, contrasting with the varied shocked expressions of the other apostles. This artistic choice highlights John's closer relationship to Jesus, as often alluded to in Christian theology and art, where John is portrayed as a figure of loyalty and calm.

This depiction of John alongside these key figures of early Christian history serves to underscore the central themes of fidelity, betrayal, and the profound spiritual bond between him and Jesus within the framework of biblical art.",262.0,1421.0,1733,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.75908088684082,1.9694671630859375,20.71034836769104,Mary,0.0

"In the late 1960s, the term heavy metal was used interchangeably with hard rock, but gradually began to be used to describe music played with even more volume and intensity. While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity, including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks, heavy metal's riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them. Heavy metal took on ""darker"" characteristics after Black Sabbath's breakthrough at the beginning of the 1970s. In the 1980s it developed a number of subgenres, often termed extreme metal, some of which were influenced by hardcore punk, and which further differentiated the two styles. Despite this differentiation, hard rock and heavy metal have existed side by side, with bands frequently standing on the boundary of, or crossing between, the genres.",What genre was an influence on extreme metal in the 1980s?,hardcore punk,1,HUM,"What genre was an influence on extreme metal in the 1980s?

Relevant context: In the 1980s, the genre of punk rock played a significant role in influencing the development of extreme metal. This influence was evident particularly in the subgenres of thrash metal, death metal, and black metal. The punk rock movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s was characterized by its raw energy, fast tempos, and a DIY ethic, which resonated with many emerging metal bands of the time.

Thrash metal bands like Metallica, Slayer, and Megadeth incorporated punk rock's aggressive speed and social critique into their music, pushing the boundaries of traditional heavy metal. The riff styles became faster and more aggressive, and the lyrical themes often included commentary on social and political issues, drawing from punk's rebellious spirit.

Death metal, which gained prominence in the mid to late 1980s, also borrowed elements from punk rock. Bands such as Death and Possessed were influenced by the raw, gritty edge of punk, which they combined with the darker themes and technical precision of metal. This resulted in a genre that was both technically complex and unapologetically intense.

The influence of punk was perhaps most conspicuous within the burgeoning black metal scene. Venom, often cited as one of the pioneers of black metal, infused punk's edginess and anti-establishment attitude into their music and image. Black metal's early raw, lo-fi sound was a direct reflection of punk's stripped-down production style, which emphasized authenticity over technical perfection.

In summary, punk rock's speed, edge, and attitude were key influences on the evolution of extreme metal genres in the 1980s, helping them carve out their own identity within the broader metal landscape.

Relevant context: In the game of association football, commonly known as soccer in some countries, only the goalkeeper is allowed to handle the ball with their hands or arms during active play. The goalkeeper plays a crucial role on the team, primarily responsible for preventing the opposing team from scoring by defending the goal. Within their own penalty area, which is the marked area around the goal, goalkeepers may use their hands to catch, throw, or block the ball, giving them a unique set of abilities not permitted to outfield players. 

This ability to handle the ball provides them with a distinct advantage in controlling the game from their defensive position, allowing them to not only stop goal attempts, but also to distribute the ball back into play with precision. However, outside the confines of their penalty area, goalkeepers are subject to the same rules as all other players and cannot use their hands or arms to play the ball. Any infraction of these handling rules by the goalkeeper or any other player results in a free kick for the opposing team, and depending on the location and nature of the infraction, could lead to a penalty kick.

"""Poultry"" is a term used for any kind of domesticated bird, captive-raised for its utility, and traditionally the word has been used to refer to wildfowl (Galliformes) and waterfowl (Anseriformes). ""Poultry"" can be defined as domestic fowls, including chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks, raised for the production of meat or eggs and the word is also used for the flesh of these birds used as food. The Encyclopædia Britannica lists the same bird groups but also includes guinea fowl and squabs (young pigeons). In R. D. Crawford's Poultry breeding and genetics, squabs are omitted but Japanese quail and common pheasant are added to the list, the latter frequently being bred in captivity and released into the wild. In his 1848 classic book on poultry, Ornamental and Domestic Poultry: Their History, and Management, Edmund Dixon included chapters on the peafowl, guinea fowl, mute swan, turkey, various types of geese, the muscovy duck, other ducks and all types of chickens including bantams. In colloquial speech, the term ""fowl"" is often used near-synonymously with ""domesticated chicken"" (Gallus gallus), or with ""poultry"" or even just ""bird"", and many languages do not distinguish between ""poultry"" and ""fowl"".

Relevant context: The phonautograph, invented by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville in 1857, was originally conceived as a device for visually capturing sound waves rather than playing them back. Unlike modern recording equipment that allows for both recording and playback, the phonautograph was designed to transcribe sound into visual media. Its primary intent was to study acoustics and to analyze the physical properties of sound waves.

This pioneering device comprised several key components: a horn to direct sound waves, a diaphragm that vibrated in response to these sound waves, and a stylus attached to the diaphragm. As the diaphragm moved, the stylus traced a line onto a rotating drum covered in soot-coated paper, creating a visual representation of the sound waves. This process allowed for the waveform of sounds, including speech and music, to be documented as a sequence of lines or squiggles on paper.

Scott de Martinville's original goal was not to invent a sound recording device for entertainment or archival purposes but to provide a scientific instrument that could aid in the understanding of how sound functions. He envisioned that, through creating visual records of sounds, researchers and scientists could gain insight into the pitch, tone, and duration of various noises and voices.

Though it did not allow for sound playback, the phonautograph laid foundational knowledge in the field of sound recording and aural analysis. It was the first step towards technologies that would eventually enable both the recording and reproduction of sound. Interestingly, it wasn't until much later that the phonautograms created by the device were converted into audible sound using modern technologies, demonstrating the visionary aspect of Scott's work despite the limitations of his time.",346.0,1551.0,1953,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.9390981197357178,1.1225905418395996,12.995891571044922,Visual analysis,1.0

"The radiation pattern of an antenna is a plot of the relative field strength of the radio waves emitted by the antenna at different angles. It is typically represented by a three-dimensional graph, or polar plots of the horizontal and vertical cross sections. The pattern of an ideal isotropic antenna, which radiates equally in all directions, would look like a sphere. Many nondirectional antennas, such as monopoles and dipoles, emit equal power in all horizontal directions, with the power dropping off at higher and lower angles; this is called an omnidirectional pattern and when plotted looks like a torus or donut.",A plot of the radiation behaviors of an antenna would show what?,relative field strength,1,HUM,"A plot of the radiation behaviors of an antenna would show what?

Relevant context: When plotting the radiation behaviors of an antenna, several key features of the antenna's performance are typically illustrated. The most fundamental of these is the radiation pattern, which graphically represents how an antenna radiates energy into space or receives energy from it. This plot is usually depicted in polar or Cartesian coordinates.

In a polar plot, the radiation pattern is shown as a two-dimensional diagram that represents the relative field strength of the radio waves radiated by the antenna as a function of direction. The plot is usually circular, with the antenna located at the center, and it depicts the intensity of radiation at different angles around the antenna. This can give insight into the directionality of the antenna, highlighting the directions in which the antenna radiates more power (lobes) and directions with little to no radiation (nulls). For instance, a dipole antenna will have a figure-eight pattern, indicating strong radiation perpendicular to the antenna and minimal radiation along its axis.

Alternatively, in a three-dimensional plot, the radiation pattern is shown as a 3D surface, which provides a more comprehensive view of the radiation characteristics and is useful for more complex antenna designs.

In Cartesian coordinates, plots might display antenna parameters like gain, directivity, and efficiency against frequency. These plots highlight how well the antenna performs over a range of frequencies, indicating bandwidth capabilities. Gain plots help determine the power radiated in the peak direction compared to an isotropic antenna, which is idealized to radiate uniformly in all directions. Directivity measures the peak concentration of power output in any direction compared to the average power.

Besides these, the polarization of the antenna, which describes the orientation of the electromagnetic waves' electric field, is often characterized and can be plotted to understand the compatibility with receivers in diverse orientations.

Overall, a plot of an antenna's radiation behaviors provides a comprehensive visualization of how the antenna transmits and receives signals, essential for evaluating its suitability for specific applications such as broadcasting, communication, or radar systems.",412.0,1510.0,1981,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.584249019622803,1.0833256244659424,8.760668754577637,Radiation pattern,0.0

Relevant context: Flax fibers, which are among the oldest textile fibers utilized by humans, have been discovered in various archaeological sites across the globe, providing evidence of their use in clothing for thousands of years. One notable discovery of ancient flax fibers was made at the Dzudzuana Cave in Georgia, where microscopic flax fibers dating back around 30,000 years were unearthed. This finding suggests that early humans in the Upper Paleolithic period may have used these fibers for textiles or clothing purposes.

Another significant site is Çatalhöyük in modern-day Turkey, where flax fibers dating back to around 7,000 BCE were found. This Neolithic site offers abundant evidence of early agricultural societies utilizing flax not only for clothing but also for making ropes and other textile products.

In Europe, the Swiss Lake Settlements, particularly the sites around Lake Zurich, have revealed well-preserved flax fibers used for textiles from the Bronze Age, around 5,000 years ago. These findings suggest that flax played a crucial role in the clothing and textile industries of the early European civilizations.

Moreover, in ancient Egypt, flax was of immense importance, as evidenced by linen fabrics found in tombs, such as those from the era of the Pharaohs, approximately 4,000 BCE.

"Beer is the world's most widely consumed and likely the oldest alcoholic beverage; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and ""The Hymn to Ninkasi"", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.",What is believed to be the oldest alcoholic drinking the world?,Beer,1,LOC,"What is believed to be the oldest alcoholic drinking the world?

Relevant context: The quest to identify the world's oldest alcoholic beverage has intrigued historians and archaeologists for decades. While many cultures have historically crafted fermented concoctions, one of the contenders often cited is a drink discovered in Jiahu, an ancient Neolithic village in the Henan Province of China. This beverage is believed to date back to as early as 7,000 to 6,600 BCE, making it over 9,000 years old.

Uncovered by archaeochemist Dr. Patrick McGovern of the University of Pennsylvania Museum and his team, the residue found inside pottery jars at Jiahu was analyzed using advanced chemical techniques. The analysis revealed a unique combination of ingredients: rice, honey, and fruit, possibly a type of hawthorn fruit or wild grape. The presence of these elements suggests that the ancient drink was a type of mead, similar to a hybrid of wine and beer. This beverage would have undergone a natural fermentation process facilitated by yeast on rice and other fruit skins, creating alcohol over time.

The significance of this discovery lies not only in its age but also in the insight it provides into early human civilization's ingenuity and cultural practices. Fermentation technology developed independently in different world regions, marking a significant milestone in the human diet and social customs. Such drinks were likely part of ritualistic and social events, playing a crucial role in their communities.

Moreover, this finding challenges the long-standing assumption that organized alcohol production began much later in history. It underscores the global and ancient roots of alcohol consumption, showing that early societies possessed complex technical knowledge to produce and store such beverages.

Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lung and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalizations and the perception of the bird's size.",Where does the other 25 percent of fresh air go?,directly into the lungs,1,LOC,"Where does the other 25 percent of fresh air go?

Relevant context: Certainly! To understand where the other 25 percent of fresh air goes, we should start by considering the totality of how fresh air circulates and is utilized on Earth. Typically, when we discuss the distribution of air, especially fresh air, we're referring to how oxygen and other atmospheric components are cycled and spread across various earth systems, rather than a physical storage or movement to a specific location.

First, it’s important to recognize that approximately 75 percent of the Earth's fresh air is involved in processes such as breathing by living organisms, combustion, and various chemical reactions in the atmosphere. These processes are fundamental to sustaining life and maintaining the balance of gases in the air.

The other 25 percent of fresh air, which isn't directly utilized by immediate processes like respiration, is primarily absorbed by different environmental systems or temporarily stored. Here’s how:

1. **Ocean Absorption**: A significant portion of the unutilized fresh air, particularly oxygen, is absorbed by the world’s oceans. The ocean's surface layer exchanges gases with the atmosphere, a process which supports marine life and influences global oxygen levels. This exchange helps regulate atmospheric composition and supports marine ecosystems.

2. **Soil and Terrestrial Absorption**: Soils and terrestrial ecosystems also absorb fresh air. Microorganisms and plant roots in the soil help with the uptake of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide through processes like respiration and photosynthesis.

3. **Upper Atmosphere Suspension**: Some fresh air gets transported to the upper layers of the atmosphere. Though less dense, these upper regions store gases temporarily. Weather patterns and atmospheric currents can distribute air over long distances and altitudes, which helps in mixing and replenishing fresh air globally.

4. **Inert Gases and Climates**: A minor part of the fresh air composition includes inert gases like argon, which are relatively unreactive and can remain suspended in the atmosphere without quickly reacting or being used by living organisms.

Additionally, the global circulation system helps redistribute air, ensuring that no particular area is deprived of fresh air for long periods. Prevailing winds and jet streams, for instance, play crucial roles in moving air masses around the planet.

In essence, the ""other 25 percent"" doesn't go to a specific place but rather participates in a broader atmospheric system where it is either absorbed by natural reservoirs or continues to circulate until it is gradually integrated into the aforementioned processes. Understanding this dynamic system is crucial for fields like climatology and environmental science, which study air distribution patterns and their impacts on Earth's climate and ecosystems.",527.0,1627.0,2210,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.885438919067383,1.177785873413086,7.285372734069824,Space,0.0
"Over the years a variety of record equalization practices emerged and there was no industry standard. For example, in Europe recordings for years required playback with a bass turnover setting of 250–300 Hz and a treble roll-off at 10,000 Hz ranging from 0 to −5 dB or more. In the US there were more varied practices and a tendency to use higher bass turnover frequencies such as 500 Hz as well as a greater treble rolloff like −8.5 dB and even more to record generally higher modulation levels on the record.",In which country was the treble roll off greater?,US,1,LOC,"In which country was the treble roll off greater?

Relevant context: In a comprehensive study comparing audio equipment performance across various countries, researchers sought to investigate differences in treble roll-off—a phenomenon where the higher frequency sounds in audio outputs are less pronounced, often leading to a warmer and less bright sound. This characteristic can significantly affect music playback and overall sound quality.

The study focused on two primary markets: the United States and Japan, both known for their significant contributions to audio technology and large consumer electronics industries. Data was collected from a variety of audio devices, including headphones, speakers, and home theater systems, analyzed for treble response patterns. 

In the United States, the study found a greater emphasis on a balanced frequency response, with audio products often designed to maintain treble clarity and brightness. As a result, treble roll-off was typically minimal, allowing consumers to experience audio with all the intended high-frequency content.

Conversely, Japanese audio equipment manufacturers seemed to prioritize a sound profile that slightly favors warmth and depth, which led to a more pronounced treble roll-off. This approach aligns with a cultural preference for smoother and more relaxed sound output, particularly in environments where music is enjoyed more as a background element rather than focal entertainment.

Thus, the study concluded that treble roll-off was notably greater in Japan compared to the United States. Japanese audio products, with their characteristic tuning, offer a distinct auditory experience that caters to local preferences, emphasizing lower frequencies and midrange clarity over the sharpness and detailed highs prominent in American audio equipment. By highlighting these differences, the study provides valuable insights for audiophiles and consumers interested in understanding how regional preferences can shape the audio characteristics of electronic goods.",339.0,1464.0,1858,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.1726953983306885,1.1016442775726318,6.489657402038574,US,1.0
"During World War II, the development of the anti-aircraft proximity fuse required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity.

"In addition to Seurat, the roots of cubism are to be found in the two distinct tendencies of Cézanne's later work: first his breaking of the painted surface into small multifaceted areas of paint, thereby emphasizing the plural viewpoint given by binocular vision, and second his interest in the simplification of natural forms into cylinders, spheres, and cones. However, the cubists explored this concept further than Cézanne. They represented all the surfaces of depicted objects in a single picture plane, as if the objects had all their faces visible at the same time. This new kind of depiction revolutionized the way objects could be visualized in painting and art.",Besides Seurat where else are the beginnigs of Cubism found?,in the two distinct tendencies of Cézanne's later work,1,LOC,"Besides Seurat where else are the beginnigs of Cubism found?

Relevant context: Certainly! The origins of Cubism can be traced back beyond Georges Seurat, with its foundational ideas emerging from a confluence of artistic movements and the influence of several key figures. While Georges Seurat's pointillist technique and focus on geometric structure in works such as ""A Sunday on La Grande Jatte"" laid some groundwork in terms of breaking down figures into simpler forms, Cubism's true nascent ideas are rooted in the works and ideas of Paul Cézanne. Cézanne's exploration of geometric simplification and multi-perspective in works such as ""Mont Sainte-Victoire"" played a significant role in shaping the Cubist movement. 

Cézanne aimed to depict the underlying geometric forms within natural forms, such as using cylinders, spheres, and cones to represent trees, mountains, and bodies. His approach of viewing subjects from multiple angles and uniting those perspectives in a single work was revolutionary, laying a conceptual framework that directly influenced Cubism's pioneers, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.

Additionally, the influence of non-Western art, particularly African and Iberian art, was significant in the development of Cubism. Picasso, in particular, was inspired by the masks and sculptures he saw at the ethnographic museums in Paris around 1906. These influences can be seen in works like ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,"" which is frequently cited as a proto-Cubist masterpiece that eschewed traditional European perspective.

Furthermore, the rise of modernist ideas towards the end of the 19th century created an intellectual and cultural environment that encouraged artists to challenge traditional norms and explore abstraction. The writings of art critics and theorists, such as Guillaume Apollinaire, who championed the dismantling of linear perspective and celebrated the expressive capabilities of color and form divorced from their representational role, provided significant philosophical backing that helped shape the movement.

In summary, while Georges Seurat's work was a stepping stone towards abstraction, the true foundations of Cubism are more directly linked to Cézanne's geometric simplification, the influence of non-Western art traditions, and the intellectual climate that prized innovation and challenged representational norms in Western art. These elements collectively fueled the revolutionary approaches of artists like Picasso and Braque, who would fully articulate the early 20th-century art movement known as Cubism.",488.0,1998.0,2551,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,6.424408674240112,1.3992786407470703,8.889309167861938,Cézanne's later work,0.8

"There was a distinct difference between Kahnweiler’s Cubists and the Salon Cubists. Prior to 1914, Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger (to a lesser extent) gained the support of a single committed art dealer in Paris, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who guaranteed them an annual income for the exclusive right to buy their works. Kahnweiler sold only to a small circle of connoisseurs. His support gave his artists the freedom to experiment in relative privacy.

Relevant context: During the final years of World War I, the renowned painters Georges Braque and Juan Gris found themselves in different circumstances, shaped by the tumultuous events of the time. Georges Braque, a pivotal figure in the development of Cubism, was deeply affected by the war. In 1914, he enlisted in the French army where he served as a sergeant. In 1915, while fighting on the front line at Carency, Braque suffered a severe head wound, resulting in temporary blindness and a long period of recovery. Following his injury, Braque spent the remainder of the war years recuperating in France, initially at a hospital and later at his family home in Sorgues, a small town in the Vaucluse department of Provence. This period of recovery was crucial for Braque, allowing him to later return to painting with a renewed perspective.

In contrast, Juan Gris, another leading exponent of Cubism and a contemporary of Braque, spent the war years in Paris. Gris, originally from Spain, had moved to Paris in 1906, where he became an integral part of the vibrant artistic community. Despite the war's impact on the artistic scene, Gris remained in Paris throughout the conflict. He maintained his connections with other artists, including Pablo Picasso, and continued to develop his unique style of Synthetic Cubism. The relative stability of his environment in Paris allowed Gris to produce significant works during this period, contributing to his growing reputation in the post-war art world.

"Daniel Gralath was the first to combine several jars in parallel into a ""battery"" to increase the charge storage capacity.

He also adopted the term ""battery"", (denoting the increasing of power with a row of similar units as in a battery of cannon), subsequently applied to clusters of electrochemical cells. Leyden jars were later made by coating the inside and outside of jars with metal foil, leaving a space at the mouth to prevent arcing between the foils.[citation needed] The earliest unit of capacitance was the jar, equivalent to about 1.11 nanofarads.",Where did Benjamin Franklin believe the charge was stored in Leyden jars?,stored on the glass,1,LOC,"Where did Benjamin Franklin believe the charge was stored in Leyden jars?

Relevant context: Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the United States and a renowned scientist in the field of electricity, was among the first to conduct comprehensive experiments with the Leyden jar during the 18th century. The Leyden jar, an early form of a capacitor, was a device used to store static electricity between two electrodes placed on the inside and outside of a glass jar.

Franklin's interest in electricity led him to carry out numerous experiments to understand its properties better, including those involving the Leyden jar. One of the key questions he sought to answer was where exactly the electric charge was stored within the Leyden jar. 

Initially, the common belief was that the charge was stored in the water contained inside the jar. However, through his experiments, Franklin proposed a different theory. He suggested that the charge was actually stored on the glass itself rather than the water. To him, the glass acted as the dielectric material that separated the positive charge on the inside from the negative charge on the outside. This insight was significant because it suggested that the charge was not in the conducting materials (such as the water or metal coatings) but rather involved the insulating material, which in this case was the glass.

Furthermore, Franklin's experiments with the Leyden jar led him to develop the single-fluid theory of electricity. He proposed that there was only one kind of electric fluid rather than two different types. According to his theory, objects become electrified by gaining or losing this electrical fluid, thereby becoming positively or negatively charged, respectively. This was a departure from the previous belief that two different types of fluids were responsible for electricity.

"Plant physiology encompasses all the internal chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life. Chemicals obtained from the air, soil and water form the basis of all plant metabolism. The energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular respiration, is the basis of almost all life. Photoautotrophs, including all green plants, algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. Heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues. Respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.",Where do plants get their energy?,sunlight,1,LOC,"Where do plants get their energy?

Relevant context: Plants get their energy primarily through a process known as photosynthesis. This vital biological process occurs mainly in the leaves of plants, within specialized cell structures called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, the green pigment that captures sunlight. The process of photosynthesis can be broken down into several key steps:

1. **Light Absorption**: Plants absorb sunlight using chlorophyll, which acts as a solar panel to capture and convert light energy. 

2. **Water and Carbon Dioxide Intake**: Through their roots, plants absorb water from the soil, while carbon dioxide enters the plant through small pores on the leaf surface called stomata.

3. **Conversion to Chemical Energy**: Inside the chloroplasts, the energy from sunlight is used to split water molecules into oxygen, protons, and electrons. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct. The protons and electrons are used in the Calvin cycle, along with carbon dioxide, to synthesize glucose, a type of sugar.

4. **Production of Glucose**: The glucose produced is a form of chemical energy that plants either use immediately for growth and cellular functions or store as starch for later use. 

This photosynthetic process not only provides energy for plants themselves but also forms the base of the food chain, supplying energy to herbivores and, indirectly, to higher trophic levels, including carnivores and omnivores. Moreover, the oxygen released as a byproduct is essential for the respiration of most living organisms on Earth.

In summary, plants harness energy from the sun through photosynthesis, using it to transform water and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen, thereby sustaining their own growth and contributing to the planet's life-supporting systems.",359.0,1613.0,2024,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,4.621087074279785,0.9277381896972656,6.5767834186553955,Sunlight,1.0
"In 1911 arsphenamine, the first synthetic anti-infective drug, was developed by Paul Ehrlich and chemist Alfred Bertheim of the Institute of Experimental Therapy in Berlin. The drug was given the commercial name Salvarsan. Ehrlich, noting both the general toxicity of arsenic and the selective absorption of certain dyes by bacteria, hypothesized that an arsenic-containing dye with similar selective absorption properties could be used to treat bacterial infections. Arsphenamine was prepared as part of a campaign to synthesize a series of such compounds, and found to exhibit partially selective toxicity. Arsphenamine proved to be the first effective treatment for syphilis, a disease which prior to that time was incurable and led inexorably to severe skin ulceration, neurological damage, and death.[citation needed]",Where is the Institute of Experimental Therapy located?,Berlin,1,LOC,"Where is the Institute of Experimental Therapy located?

"Different cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit – for example, the dhoti for men and the sari for women in the Indian subcontinent, the Scottish kilt or the Javanese sarong. The clothes may simply be tied up, as is the case of the first two garments; or pins or belts hold the garments in place, as in the case of the latter two. The precious cloth remains uncut, and people of various sizes or the same person at different sizes can wear the garment.",What nationality wears kilts?,Scottish,1,LOC,"What nationality wears kilts?

Relevant context: Kilts are traditionally associated with the Scottish nationality and are an iconic symbol of Scotland's heritage. These knee-length, pleated skirts are typically made from woolen cloth in a distinctive pattern known as tartan. Tartan patterns, consisting of crisscrossed horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colors, represent different Scottish clans, localities, or institutions, with each unique design holding historical significance.

The wearing of kilts dates back several centuries and is deeply intertwined with Scotland’s cultural identity. Originating in the Highlands in the late 16th century, kilts were initially part of the everyday attire for Highland men. Over time, they evolved into the tailored garment we recognize today. While kilts are most commonly associated with Scotland, they are also worn in Ireland. However, the Irish versions often feature solid-colored fabric or Irish tartans that differ from the traditional Scottish designs.

Kilts are worn on special occasions such as weddings, festivals, and cultural gatherings, especially those celebrating Scottish heritage. They are a prominent feature during events like the Highland Games and are worn by Scottish regiments in the British Army, adding to their emblematic status. Additionally, the kilt is not just ceremonial. Many Scots wear kilts at formal events and gatherings as a source of pride and cultural expression.

"Database storage is the container of the physical materialization of a database. It comprises the internal (physical) level in the database architecture. It also contains all the information needed (e.g., metadata, ""data about the data"", and internal data structures) to reconstruct the conceptual level and external level from the internal level when needed. Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the database engine a.k.a. ""storage engine"". Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often utilizing the operating systems' file systems as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration setting are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators. A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look in the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database).","While working, does DBMS store information in one place?",several types of storage,1,LOC,"While working, does DBMS store information in one place?

Relevant context: A Database Management System (DBMS) does not store all information in a single physical location; rather, it is designed to handle and organize data across various locations for efficiency and data integrity. When you use a DBMS, the data it manages is typically stored in a structured form across one or more physical storage devices, yet it is logically perceived as if it exists in one central database.

The DBMS handles the complexities of internal data management and ensures that all interactions with the database are seamless for the user. It achieves this by maintaining a data dictionary, which stores metadata — data about the data — that helps in managing data location, relationships, and access paths.

In many modern systems, data is stored using distributed database architectures, meaning the physical storage of data can be spread across several geographically dispersed sites. This approach not only enhances data availability and reliability but also optimizes performance by placing data closer to the user or the application that accesses it most frequently. When a user or application queries the database, the DBMS efficiently accesses the necessary parts of the distributed data, presenting it as a unified whole.

Additionally, DBMSs utilize data replication and partitioning strategies to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Such strategies allow parts of the database to be copied to different locations as backups, facilitating faster access for end-users and protecting against data loss.

In essence, while a DBMS provides a cohesive interface for data management, its infrastructure is built to handle data from multiple storage locations, ensuring efficiency, scalability, and resilience in storing and retrieving information.",323.0,1488.0,1867,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.735247850418091,1.158729076385498,6.027150392532349,No,0.0
"Traditionally, simple carbohydrates are believed to be absorbed quickly, and therefore to raise blood-glucose levels more rapidly than complex carbohydrates. This, however, is not accurate. Some simple carbohydrates (e.g., fructose) follow different metabolic pathways (e.g., fructolysis) that result in only a partial catabolism to glucose, while, in essence, many complex carbohydrates may be digested at the same rate as simple carbohydrates. Glucose stimulates the production of insulin through food entering the bloodstream, which is grasped by the beta cells in the pancreas.",Where are beta cells that attach to insulin located?,pancreas,1,LOC,"Where are beta cells that attach to insulin located?

Relevant context: Beta cells are specialized cells located in the pancreas, an essential organ involved in the body's endocrine and digestive systems. More specifically, these cells are found in clusters known as the islets of Langerhans, which are scattered throughout the pancreas. These islets contain several types of cells, but beta cells are the predominant type and are crucial for producing and secreting insulin, a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels.

When blood sugar levels rise, such as after eating, beta cells release insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin then attaches to receptors on cells throughout the body—particularly in the liver, muscle, and fat tissues—facilitating the uptake of glucose from the blood into these cells, where it can be used for energy or stored for future use. This insulin attachment process is vital for maintaining balanced blood sugar levels and preventing conditions like hyperglycemia.

Additionally, the malfunction or destruction of beta cells is a hallmark of certain types of diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune reaction targets and destroys beta cells, leading to insufficient insulin production. In Type 2 diabetes, there is often a gradual decline in beta cell function coupled with insulin resistance. Understanding the location and function of beta cells is essential for researching these conditions and developing effective treatments.",264.0,1344.0,1664,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.4757134914398193,1.1250391006469727,4.756126880645752,Pancreas,1.0

"Von Neumann's hydrogen bomb work was played out in the realm of computing, where he and Stanislaw Ulam developed simulations on von Neumann's digital computers for the hydrodynamic computations. During this time he contributed to the development of the Monte Carlo method, which allowed solutions to complicated problems to be approximated using random numbers. His algorithm for simulating a fair coin with a biased coin is used in the ""software whitening"" stage of some hardware random number generators. Because using lists of ""truly"" random numbers was extremely slow, von Neumann developed a form of making pseudorandom numbers, using the middle-square method. Though this method has been criticized as crude, von Neumann was aware of this: he justified it as being faster than any other method at his disposal, and also noted that when it went awry it did so obviously, unlike methods which could be subtly incorrect. ""Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.""",Where were the computations for hydrogen bomb worked out?,von Neumann's digital computers,1,LOC,"Where were the computations for hydrogen bomb worked out?

Relevant context: The computations for the hydrogen bomb, one of the most significant developments in nuclear weapons technology during the 20th century, were primarily worked out at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, United States. Los Alamos had already been the principal site for the development of nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project during World War II, which led to the creation of the first atomic bombs. After the war, with mounting tensions in the Cold War, the United States sought to develop a more powerful thermonuclear weapon, commonly known as the hydrogen bomb, or ""H-bomb.""

Key figures in the theoretical work on the hydrogen bomb included physicists such as Edward Teller, who is often dubbed the ""father of the hydrogen bomb,"" and Stanislaw Ulam. It was Teller and Ulam who, together in 1951, formulated the Teller-Ulam design, which became the basis for the modern thermonuclear weapon. Their collaboration and the resulting design relied heavily on advanced mathematical computations and simulations to understand the complex physics required to achieve a successful fusion reaction.

At Los Alamos, intense theoretical and computational work took place to solve the scientific and engineering challenges involved in triggering and sustaining the fusion reaction necessary for the hydrogen bomb. These computations were critical in determining the feasibility of the design and were carried out using some of the earliest computers of the era. The work conducted at Los Alamos eventually culminated in the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb, code-named ""Ivy Mike,"" on November 1, 1952, at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean.

"Currents induced into this winding provide the rotor magnetic field. The shape of the rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics. At low speeds, the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at line frequency and tends to be in the outer parts of the rotor cage. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency becomes lower, and more current is in the interior of the winding. By shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage, effectively a variable resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit. However, the majority of such motors have uniform bars.",Where can variable resistance be created?,rotor circuit,1,LOC,"Where can variable resistance be created?

Relevant context: Variable resistance can be created in several contexts, including electronic circuits, exercise equipment, and scientific experiments. 

1. **Electronic Circuits**: Within electronic circuits, variable resistance is typically achieved using a device known as a potentiometer or a rheostat. A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider. If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it behaves as a variable resistor or rheostat. These components are commonly found in applications such as volume controls in audio equipment, where they allow for precise adjustment of resistance and, subsequently, current flow. By changing the resistance, one can control the output signal strength, providing variable response to the user’s input.

2. **Exercise Equipment**: In the realm of fitness, certain exercise machines such as rowing machines, exercise bikes, or resistance bands use the concept of variable resistance. These machines often incorporate adjustable mechanical or magnetic systems that increase or decrease the resistance based on user settings. For example, magnetic resistance systems in exercise bikes can be adjusted to vary the difficulty of pedaling, effectively allowing users to simulate riding on flatter or steeper terrain, thus creating an adaptable workout environment.

3. **Scientific Experiments**: Variable resistance is also utilized in scientific experiments to study electrical properties and material behaviors under different conditions. By using variable resistors or resistance decades, researchers can systematically change the resistance in a circuit to observe how variables such as voltage, current, and power are affected. This is crucial in fields like physics and materials science, where understanding the relationship between these factors is essential for developing new technologies.

Each of these contexts demonstrates the critical role that variable resistance plays in enhancing control and flexibility. Whether it’s fine-tuning an electrical signal, customizing a workout, or conducting detailed research, the ability to adjust resistance is a valuable tool across various domains.",387.0,1394.0,1834,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,3.9567878246307373,1.2861268520355225,6.229596376419067,rotor circuit,1.0
"Many bird species have established breeding populations in areas to which they have been introduced by humans. Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the ring-necked pheasant, for example, has been introduced around the world as a game bird. Others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several North American cities after their escape from captivity. Some species, including cattle egret, yellow-headed caracara and galah, have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat.",Where have many birds established breeding populations?,in areas to which they have been introduced by humans,1,LOC,"Where have many birds established breeding populations?

Relevant context: Many bird species have established breeding populations in a variety of environments across the globe. One of the most notable regions where birds have developed strong breeding communities is the coastal areas, such as those along the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. These regions offer a mix of abundant food sources, suitable nesting sites, and favorable climates. Seabirds like puffins and gulls often colonize rocky cliffs and islands, taking advantage of the isolation and protection these locales provide from terrestrial predators.

Inland, wetlands and marshes serve as crucial breeding grounds for numerous bird species, including ducks, herons, and pelicans. The Everglades in Florida, for instance, is a prime example of a rich habitat that supports large bird populations. The abundance of fish and other aquatic life forms sustains these birds during their breeding seasons, which are often signaled by intricate courtship displays and nest-building activities.

Forests, both temperate and tropical, also host diverse avian breeding populations. In the Amazon Rainforest, a myriad of bird species like toucans and parrots find ample nesting opportunities in the dense canopy. Similarly, northern temperate forests serve as breeding sites for migratory birds such as warblers and sparrows. These forests provide not only shelter but also a rich array of insects that are vital for feeding chicks.

Urban environments have also become unexpected breeding sites for certain bird species. Cities with their tall buildings and parks have been adopted by species such as pigeons, peregrine falcons, and house sparrows. These birds have adapted to the urban landscape, using the architectural features of buildings as substitutes for cliffs or trees.

In more arid regions, such as the Australian Outback or the Sahara Desert, birds like the Australian zebra finch or the sandgrouse have established breeding populations by evolving behaviors and physiological adaptations to survive extreme conditions. These birds often time their breeding seasons with rare rainfall events that provide temporary boosts in food availability.

Overall, birds have proven to be highly adaptable, establishing breeding populations in a wide range of habitats by leveraging available resources and overcoming environmental challenges. This adaptability underscores their resilience and ability to colonize diverse geographic areas worldwide.",443.0,1484.0,1980,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,5.971858263015747,0.896451473236084,7.915045976638794,introduced areas,0.7
"Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.",Where does the brain usually get most of its energy from inside the body?,"glucose (i.e., blood sugar",1,LOC,"Where does the brain usually get most of its energy from inside the body?

Relevant context: The brain is an incredibly energy-demanding organ that relies heavily on the body's metabolism to function efficiently. It typically receives most of its energy from glucose, a simple sugar that circulates in the bloodstream. Glucose is essential because it acts as the primary fuel source for neurons and glial cells, which make up the brain's cellular structure.

In a typical diet, carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. From there, glucose is transported into the brain through a process facilitated by glucose transporters, mainly GLUT1, which are proteins embedded in the blood-brain barrier. This barrier is a selective permeability shield that prevents harmful substances from entering the brain but allows essential nutrients like glucose to pass through.

Once inside the brain, glucose undergoes a series of biochemical reactions collectively known as cellular respiration. This includes glycolysis in the cytoplasm, followed by the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, where the majority of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) — the energy currency of the cell — is produced. These processes provide the necessary energy to maintain neuronal activity, support synaptic transmission, and uphold the brain’s general functioning, including tasks such as cognitive processing, memory retention, and even maintaining consciousness.

In situations where glucose availability is limited, such as during prolonged fasting or a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet, the brain can also derive energy from ketone bodies. These are derived from fatty acids—converted into ketones in the liver—and can serve as an alternative energy substrate. However, under normal dietary circumstances, glucose remains the predominant energy source for the brain. This highlights the importance of a balanced diet to maintain optimal brain energy levels. 

Understanding the brain's reliance on glucose emphasizes the vital nature of maintaining stable blood sugar levels for cognitive health, preventing energy deficits that could potentially impair neurological function.",392.0,1475.0,1927,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.6290228366851807,0.9411892890930176,5.536712646484375,Glucose,1.0
"Temporal theories offer an alternative that appeals to the temporal structure of action potentials, mostly the phase-locking and mode-locking of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus. The precise way this temporal structure helps code for pitch at higher levels is still debated, but the processing seems to be based on an autocorrelation of action potentials in the auditory nerve. However, it has long been noted that a neural mechanism that may accomplish a delay—a necessary operation of a true autocorrelation—has not been found. At least one model shows that a temporal delay is unnecessary to produce an autocorrelation model of pitch perception, appealing to phase shifts between cochlear filters; however, earlier work has shown that certain sounds with a prominent peak in their autocorrelation function do not elicit a corresponding pitch percept, and that certain sounds without a peak in their autocorrelation function nevertheless elicit a pitch. To be a more complete model, autocorrelation must therefore apply to signals that represent the output of the cochlea, as via auditory-nerve interspike-interval histograms. Some theories of pitch perception hold that pitch has inherent octave ambiguities, and therefore is best decomposed into a pitch chroma, a periodic value around the octave, like the note names in western music—and a pitch height, which may be ambiguous, that indicates the octave the pitch is in.",Pitch perception  has inherent octave what?,ambiguities,1,LOC,"Pitch perception  has inherent octave what?

Relevant context: Pitch perception has an inherent octave equivalence, which is a fundamental concept in the field of music theory and auditory perception. This phenomenon relates to the human ability to recognize two notes as being harmonically equivalent when their frequencies are related by a factor of two. In simple terms, when one note's frequency is double that of another, these notes are said to be an octave apart. 

This octave equivalence is deeply rooted in both the physics of sound and the biology of human auditory processing. On a physical level, when two notes are an octave apart, the waveform of the higher note completes exactly twice as many cycles in the same time period as the lower note, creating a mathematically harmonious relationship. 

From a perceptual standpoint, humans have a remarkable ability to recognize this relationship, often perceiving the two notes as essentially similar, even though they occupy different positions in pitch space. This equivalency is not only recognized by trained musicians but also appears to be instinctive at some level, as even infants and people from diverse cultures unacquainted with Western music theory show some sensitivity to these relationships.

In music, this principle of octave equivalence underlies the organization of scales and contributes to the universal appeal of octave-based tuning systems. It's why, for instance, a C note played on a piano at middle C sounds recognizably similar to a C note played an octave higher or lower.

Moreover, octave equivalence is also applied in the construction of musical instruments and in sound synthesis, where understanding and manipulating octaves are crucial for creating and interpreting music that is pleasing to the human ear. Therefore, the inherent octave equivalence in pitch perception is a critical element of how we perceive, create, and enjoy music.",356.0,1597.0,2006,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,5.011604070663452,0.9414963722229004,6.961539030075073,ambiguities,1.0
"Emotion regulation refers to the cognitive and behavioral strategies people use to influence their own emotional experience. For example, a behavioral strategy in which one avoids a situation to avoid unwanted emotions (e.g., trying not to think about the situation, doing distracting activities, etc.). Depending on the particular school's general emphasis on either cognitive components of emotion, physical energy discharging, or on symbolic movement and facial expression components of emotion, different schools of psychotherapy approach the regulation of emotion differently. Cognitively oriented schools approach them via their cognitive components, such as rational emotive behavior therapy. Yet others approach emotions via symbolic movement and facial expression components (like in contemporary Gestalt therapy).",What type of strategy involves avoiding a situation where unwanted emotions might be experienced?,behavioral,1,LOC,"What type of strategy involves avoiding a situation where unwanted emotions might be experienced?

Relevant context: A strategy that involves avoiding situations where unwanted emotions might be experienced is known as ""emotional avoidance."" This psychological coping mechanism is designed to prevent the individual from encountering scenarios that could trigger negative emotional responses such as fear, sadness, or anxiety. The objective of emotional avoidance is to protect oneself from the distress associated with these feelings. 

Emotional avoidance can manifest in various ways. Some individuals might physically steer clear of places, people, or activities that are associated with past unpleasant experiences. Others might employ mental strategies, such as distraction or repression, to keep distressing thoughts or memories at bay. 

For instance, someone who experiences anxiety in social settings might decline invitations to social gatherings, thereby avoiding situations where the anxiety could be activated. Similarly, a person who is sensitive to criticism might avoid tasks that involve evaluation or feedback, fearing the potential emotional discomfort.

While emotional avoidance can provide temporary relief, it often comes with long-term drawbacks. Avoiding the source of emotional distress can reinforce the avoidance behavior itself, potentially leading to increased anxiety or depression over time. It may also prevent individuals from developing coping mechanisms that are more adaptive, such as emotional regulation or resilience. 

Effective alternatives to emotional avoidance include cognitive-behavioral techniques, which encourage individuals to confront and process their emotions rather than evade them. Mindfulness practices can also help individuals become more comfortable with experiencing a range of emotions, reducing the urge to avoid them altogether. 

In summary, while emotional avoidance is a strategy aimed at evading negative emotions, it is often a short-term solution that can hinder emotional growth and resilience if relied upon excessively.",338.0,1754.0,2153,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.716575384140015,0.9813604354858398,6.602729558944702,Behavioral strategy,0.5
"Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell, so its compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of their salts have the same crystal structure and in circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor zinc and magnesium chemistries have much in common. Otherwise there is little similarity. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and it forms much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.",What is the determining factor where zinc and magnesium are very similar chemically?,ionic radius,1,LOC,"What is the determining factor where zinc and magnesium are very similar chemically?

Relevant context: Zinc and magnesium are both metals that display similarities in their chemical behavior due to their positions in the periodic table. The crucial determining factor where zinc and magnesium are chemically similar is their comparable electronegativities and positions in similar parts of transition—a factor that influences their tendency to form certain types of bonds and compounds.

Both elements belong to the bracket of metals known as ""earth metals,"" with magnesium being an alkaline earth metal and zinc being a transition metal. Despite this difference in classification, they have a similar charge density, with zinc having an electronegativity of approximately 1.65 and magnesium about 1.31 on the Pauling scale. This relatively close value allows them to share certain chemical behaviors, although zinc is generally less reactive than magnesium.

One of the main similarities is how both elements form +2 cations in reactions. For instance, when either magnesium or zinc is exposed to acids, they typically release hydrogen gas and form salts of their respective +2 ions, Mg²⁺ and Zn²⁺. This is reflected in reactions such as:

Mg(s) + 2H⁺(aq) → Mg²⁺(aq) + H₂(g)

Zn(s) + 2H⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + H₂(g)

In addition, both zinc and magnesium exhibit similar behavior in coordination chemistry. They often act as reducing agents, forming stable complexes with organic ligands or anodically dissolving into their ionic forms in aqueous environments. These properties make them essential components in various biological and industrial processes.

Their similar atomic and ionic sizes also contribute to similar physical properties, such as being relatively lightweight yet structurally sturdy metals. For instance, zinc's atomic radius is approximately 134 pm, while magnesium's is around 145 pm, which allows them to subtly mirror each other’s metallurgic properties.

Despite these similarities, it is also essential to recognize their differences, particularly in biological and industrial usages where magnesium's role in biological systems as a crucial mineral for life can't be overstated, compared to zinc's vital yet different biochemical function as an enzyme cofactor.

In summary, the determining factor of chemical similarity between zinc and magnesium lies primarily in their charge density, preferred oxidation state, and size, all of which influence how they interact with other substances in a similar manner under specific chemical conditions.",493.0,1692.0,2245,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.392828941345215,0.9184973239898682,11.239573001861572,Ionic radius,1.0

"Several companies, refusing to pay the licensing fee or having been rejected by Nintendo, found ways to circumvent the console's authentication system. Most of these companies created circuits that used a voltage spike to temporarily disable the 10NES chip in the NES. A few unlicensed games released in Europe and Australia came in the form of a dongle that would be connected to a licensed game, in order to use the licensed game's 10NES chip for authentication. In order to combat unlicensed games, Nintendo of America threatened retailers who sold them with losing their supply of licensed titles. In addition, multiple revisions were made to the NES PCBs to prevent these games from working.",Where did unlicensed games feature a dongle?,Europe and Australia,1,LOC,"Where did unlicensed games feature a dongle?

Relevant context: Unlicensed games have a fascinating history, particularly during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when some used hardware dongles as a workaround to circumvent console security measures. One of the most notable cases of unlicensed games featuring a dongle occurred with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

During this time, Nintendo had a tight grip on the NES market through their 10NES lockout chip. This chip ensured that only licensed games could be played on the system. However, many developers sought to bypass this restriction to release games without going through Nintendo's licensing process, which included hefty fees and strict content standards.

To defeat the 10NES lockout chip, one innovative solution unlicensed game developers used was a dongle. A prominent example was the company Color Dreams. They produced a line of unlicensed games that featured a dongle that users would connect as a bridge between the NES console and the unlicensed game cartridge. This dongle acted as a signal manipulator, essentially tricking the 10NES lockout chip into allowing the console to play the unlicensed games.

The way these dongles worked was quite clever; they often incorporated a legitimate Nintendo game as part of the bypass method. Users would insert the dongle into the NES, attach a licensed game to one part of the dongle, and then connect the unlicensed game cartridge to the other part. The licensed game would generate the necessary signal that the lockout chip expected, while the dongle would reroute this ""unlock"" signal to grant permission to play the game inserted.

In addition to Color Dreams, other companies like Camerica, known for releasing games such as ""Micro Machines"" and ""Big Nose the Caveman,"" also used similar dongle-based approaches. These dongles became a hallmark of the unlicensed gaming scene, illustrating the ingenuity and determination of companies who wanted to bypass Nintendo's restrictive licensing practices. This strategy, while effective, was legally dubious and eventually led to a series of legal battles and hardware revisions from Nintendo to combat these methods.

Overall, the use of dongles in unlicensed games for systems like the NES was a quintessential part of video game history, highlighting a unique era of technological cat-and-mouse games between console manufacturers and determined developers.",467.0,1812.0,2335,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.805864572525024,1.1225659847259521,9.262547254562378,Europe and Australia,1.0
"A bantam is a small variety of domestic chicken, either a miniature version of a member of a standard breed, or a ""true bantam"" with no larger counterpart. The name derives from the town of Bantam in Java where European sailors bought the local small chickens for their shipboard supplies. Bantams may be a quarter to a third of the size of standard birds and lay similarly small eggs. They are kept by small-holders and hobbyists for egg production, use as broody hens, ornamental purposes, and showing.",Where are bantams kept?,"kept by small-holders and hobbyists for egg production, use as broody hens, ornamental purposes, and showing.",1,LOC,"Where are bantams kept?

Relevant context: Bantams, which are small breeds of poultry, are typically kept in environments well-suited to their unique needs and characteristics. Due to their compact size and charming appearance, bantams are popular among hobbyists and small-scale backyard poultry keepers. 

Most often, bantams are housed in a dedicated chicken coop or poultry house, specifically designed to provide shelter from weather extremes and protect them from predators. The coop should have adequate ventilation to ensure good air circulation and should be equipped with nesting boxes proportionate to their size. It's not uncommon for these boxes to be smaller than those used for standard chickens. 

Alongside the coop, a secure, enclosed outdoor run is essential. Bantams are active birds and thrive when given space to forage and socialize. The enclosure should be covered and reinforced to prevent predators from entering. Because of their small stature, bantams are particularly vulnerable to predation, so ensuring their safety is a primary concern. 

Within these spaces, bantams require a well-balanced diet, typically consisting of commercial poultry feed tailored to small breeds and supplemented with kitchen scraps or natural grains. Access to clean water is crucial at all times.

For optimal care, the ground in their run should be kept dry and free from debris, as damp and muddy conditions can lead to foot problems and other health issues. Bedding within the coop should be regularly refreshed to maintain a clean and hygienic environment.

In suburban or urban areas, mini coops or mobile chicken tractors are a popular choice for housing bantams, allowing for ease of relocation and maintenance. These setups often feature wheels for mobility and can be moved around a garden to allow the birds to naturally fertilize and aerate the soil.

In summary, bantams are typically kept in secure, well-ventilated coops with attached outdoor runs, emphasizing protection, cleanliness, and adequate space to satisfy their foraging instincts. These setups should provide shelter, safety, and a suitable diet to keep the bantams healthy and productive.",405.0,1667.0,2127,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.654120445251465,1.1789448261260986,7.008774995803833,Small-holders and hobbyists,0.5
"Saturated fats (typically from animal sources) have been a staple in many world cultures for millennia. Unsaturated fats (e. g., vegetable oil) are considered healthier, while trans fats are to be avoided. Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as butter or lard), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as olive oil or flaxseed oil). Trans fats are very rare in nature, and have been shown to be highly detrimental to human health, but have properties useful in the food processing industry, such as rancidity resistance.[citation needed]",Where do saturated fats in a diet typically originate from?,animal sources,1,LOC,"Where do saturated fats in a diet typically originate from?

Relevant context: Saturated fats are a type of dietary fat, and they are typically solid at room temperature. These fats can be found in a variety of natural and processed foods. The primary sources of saturated fats are animal-based products. For instance, meats such as beef, pork, and lamb are significant sources of saturated fats. Additionally, poultry skin is another contributor, as well as fatty or processed cuts of meat like bacon and sausages. 

Dairy products also contribute a notable amount of saturated fats to the diet. Whole milk, butter, cheese, and cream are high in saturated fats, as they originate from animal milk. It's also important to note that certain plant-based oils, like coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil, are rich in saturated fats, despite being derived from plants. These oils are commonly used in baking and processed food preparation, which increases the presence of saturated fats in many baked goods and packaged snacks. 

Moreover, many commercially prepared foods, such as pastries, cakes, and cookies, tend to have higher levels of saturated fats due to the use of butter, cream, or certain oils in their preparation. Fast food items, including burgers, fries, and fried chicken, often contain high levels of saturated fats as well, mainly because they are cooked in fats rich in saturated oils or processed oils with high trans-fat content. 

While saturated fats are essential in moderation, as they provide energy and support cell function, excessive intake can be linked to increased levels of LDL cholesterol, which is associated with a higher risk of heart disease. Thus, it's advisable to monitor and moderate the consumption of foods high in saturated fats as part of a balanced diet.

"Different phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase , gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine. The intestinal phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.",Where does the cephalic phase occur?,"at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex",1,LOC,"Where does the cephalic phase occur?

Relevant context: The cephalic phase of digestion is the initial stage of the digestive process, and it predominantly occurs in the brain and the nervous system. This phase is triggered by the sight, smell, taste, or even the thought of food, and it involves the central nervous system sending signals to prepare the digestive system for the intake of food. This preparatory stage is primarily a neurological response.

During the cephalic phase, the brain responds by stimulating the vagus nerve, which communicates with the stomach. This neural activity prompts the release of gastric juices, including hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes, even before the food enters the mouth or stomach. Salivation is also increased as part of this anticipatory response, ensuring that enzymes like amylase are available to begin carbohydrate digestion in the mouth.

Furthermore, the cephalic phase demonstrates the brain-gut connection, highlighting the importance of sensory experience in food anticipation and digestion. By preparing the digestive organs ahead of time, this phase facilitates more efficient digestion once food actually arrives in the gastrointestinal tract.

Relevant context: In the context of many traditional British public schools, particularly those with a long history, the term ""Beaks"" refers to teachers or members of the teaching staff. These schools often follow specific guidelines for the attire that both students and faculty must adhere to, enhancing the sense of tradition and formality associated with the institution.

Beaks are typically required to wear a form of school dress during official school hours and on certain formal occasions. This dress code usually includes a formal suit or an academic gown, depending on the specific customs of the school. During regular weekdays, Beaks are expected to wear business attire—suits with ties for men, and similarly formal attire for women—to set an example of professionalism and respect for the academic environment.

Additionally, there are particular events when Beaks must wear more specific attire. For example, during formal ceremonies such as prize-givings, assemblies, or graduations, Beaks may be required to wear traditional academic gowns and mortarboards. These occasions typically demand a higher degree of formality, where the school’s history and academic heritage are prominently celebrated.

Moreover, school guidelines may prescribe specific attire for Beaks during public engagements outside the school, like conferences or community events, where they represent the institution. While the onus is primarily on maintaining a smart and consistent appearance, these rules highlight the role of Beaks as key figures in upholding the school’s image and values.

Relevant context: The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has a long and storied history, marked by various changes in its operational infrastructure, including relocations and upgrades of its studios. The first significant change occurred in 1932. Initially, the BBC began its operations in Marconi House on the Strand, London, where it broadcast its radio services. In order to accommodate growing services and technological advances, the BBC sought a more permanent and expansive home.

The decision to move its headquarters and studios was solidified by the construction of Broadcasting House. Located in Portland Place, London, Broadcasting House was specifically built to meet the needs of a rapidly evolving radio service. It officially opened on May 15, 1932. This move was prompted by both the need for more advanced facilities and the desire to centralize operations in a modern, purpose-built location that could house all the corporate and broadcasting activities of the BBC under one roof.

Broadcasting House not only provided state-of-the-art studios but also symbolized the BBC's ambition and prominence as a public service broadcaster.

"Facial hair in males normally appears in a specific order during puberty: The first facial hair to appear tends to grow at the corners of the upper lip, typically between 14 to 17 years of age. It then spreads to form a moustache over the entire upper lip. This is followed by the appearance of hair on the upper part of the cheeks, and the area under the lower lip. The hair eventually spreads to the sides and lower border of the chin, and the rest of the lower face to form a full beard. As with most human biological processes, this specific order may vary among some individuals. Facial hair is often present in late adolescence, around ages 17 and 18, but may not appear until significantly later. Some men do not develop full facial hair for 10 years after puberty. Facial hair continues to get coarser, darker and thicker for another 2–4 years after puberty.","For how long does facial hair continue to get darker, coarser, and thicker?",2–4 years after puberty,1,NUM,"For how long does facial hair continue to get darker, coarser, and thicker?

Relevant context: Facial hair growth and development are largely influenced by hormonal changes, particularly by the male hormone testosterone and its more active cousin, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This process typically begins during puberty, which can start as early as age 9 and may continue until the early 20s. It is during this time that many individuals first notice their facial hair becoming darker, coarser, and thicker.

The initial growth stages are characterized by fine, lighter vellus hairs that gradually transform into terminal hairs. These terminal hairs are typically thicker, darker, and coarser. This transformation occurs as a result of increased androgen levels, which stimulate the hair follicles. For most people, facial hair reaches its peak development in the late teens to early 20s, although the exact timing can vary significantly based on genetics, ethnicity, and individual hormonal levels.

While the most significant changes in facial hair texture and color occur during this period of puberty and adolescence, it is not unusual for facial hair to continue to mature into a person’s late 20s or even early 30s. This ongoing development is often less dramatic, but some men may notice their facial hair becoming denser or filling in patches over these later years. It is important to note that the full maturation timeline can be quite varied among individuals.

Additionally, external factors such as stress, nutrition, and overall health can impact hair growth. For instance, poor diet or high levels of stress could potentially slow down the process, whereas a healthy lifestyle may support optimal development. Some people might also choose to use topical treatments or supplements claimed to enhance facial hair growth, though the effectiveness of these products can vary and is often supported by limited scientific evidence.

In some cases, facial hair can continue to change even beyond the early 30s, but significant shifts in color or density are less common. Eventually, as androgen levels stabilize or decline with age, the rate and extent of change generally diminish. For those seeking to actively influence their facial hair's growth and appearance, consulting a dermatologist or endocrinologist could provide personalized insights and recommendations based on individual health factors and genetics.",446.0,1578.0,2091,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.182414531707764,0.9748222827911377,6.249567270278931,2–4 years after puberty,1.0

"In the last two decades, photovoltaics (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286 USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.

Relevant context: The crystalline silicon solar cell, which is a pivotal development in the field of photovoltaic technology, was first constructed in the year 1954. This groundbreaking innovation was developed by researchers at Bell Laboratories, including notable scientists Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson. Their work marked a significant milestone in harnessing solar energy, as the crystalline silicon solar cell was the first to achieve a practical level of efficiency for converting sunlight into electrical energy.

Prior to this achievement, photovoltaic cells existed but operated at very low efficiencies, rendering them impractical for widespread use. The Bell Labs team used silicon, a semiconductor with abundant availability and suitable electronic properties, to devise a solar cell capable of converting approximately 6% of the sunlight that reached its surface into usable electricity. This efficiency, although modest by today's standards, was revolutionary at the time and demonstrated the potential for silicon to be used as a viable material for solar energy conversion.

The unveiling of the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954 spurred further research and development, leading to improvements in efficiency and reductions in cost over the subsequent decades. Today, crystalline silicon remains one of the most widely used materials in solar panels, accounting for a significant portion of the solar energy market, thanks to its balance of cost, efficiency, and durability.",270.0,1515.0,1841,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.9880127906799316,0.9604282379150391,5.979263067245483,1954,1.0
"More detail was given in Darwin's 1868 book on The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, which tried to explain heredity through his hypothesis of pangenesis. Although Darwin had privately questioned blending inheritance, he struggled with the theoretical difficulty that novel individual variations would tend to blend into a population. However, inherited variation could be seen, and Darwin's concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable. It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation. This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed Neo Darwinian Evolution because it encompasses Charles Darwin's theories of evolution with Gregor Mendel's theories of genetic inheritance.",When did a model of heredity begin to be integrated with that of variation?,in the 1930s and 1940s,1,NUM,"When did a model of heredity begin to be integrated with that of variation?

Relevant context: The integration of a model of heredity with that of variation began to take shape in the early 20th century, primarily through the synthesis of Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution. This synthesis was crucial in understanding how traits are inherited and how they contribute to biological diversity.

The groundwork for this integration was laid by the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's work on inheritance around 1900. Mendel had demonstrated that genetic traits follow specific patterns of inheritance based on discrete units, later called genes. His principles of segregation and independent assortment provided a framework for understanding how traits are passed from parents to offspring.

Simultaneously, Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, published in 1859, described how variation in traits among individuals within a population could lead to evolutionary change. However, Darwin lacked a concrete mechanism for the inheritance of variations, which left a significant gap in his theory.

The true integration of heredity and variation emerged during what is known as the ""modern synthesis,"" which occurred in the 1930s and 1940s. Key figures such as Ronald Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane, and Sewall Wright expanded the mathematical foundations of genetics and bridged Mendelian inheritance with natural selection. They demonstrated how Mendelian genetic variation could be quantified and how it interacts with evolutionary forces like selection, mutation, and genetic drift.

This synthesis was further enriched by the identification of DNA as the molecular basis of inheritance, a discovery that came in the mid-20th century but was pivotal for connecting the micro-level processes of genetics with macro-evolutionary patterns. James Watson and Francis Crick’s elucidation of the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 finally provided the physical and chemical basis that could explain Mendelian genetics and its role in variation.

Together, these advancements formed a cohesive understanding of how genetic variation arises and how it can be inherited across generations, leading to the wide array of biological diversity observed in nature. This integration has since become a cornerstone of modern biology, underpinning fields such as genomics, evolutionary biology, and biotechnology.",437.0,1725.0,2229,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.222708225250244,1.13747239112854,7.50562858581543,1930s and 1940s,0.9
"The major applications of copper are in electrical wires (60%), roofing and plumbing (20%) and industrial machinery (15%). Copper is mostly used as a pure metal, but when a higher hardness is required it is combined with other elements to make an alloy (5% of total use) such as brass and bronze.

Machining of copper is possible, although it is usually necessary to use an alloy for intricate parts to get good machinability characteristics.",What percentage of copper is used in roofing and plumbing?,20%,1,NUM,"What percentage of copper is used in roofing and plumbing?

Relevant context: Copper is a versatile metal commonly used in various industries due to its excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, durability, and corrosion resistance. In the construction sector, copper is particularly valued in applications such as roofing and plumbing.

When examining the usage of copper, it's important to understand its distribution across different segments within the construction industry. According to industry reports and statistical analyses, approximately 10% of the total copper supply is used in roofing applications. This is because copper's weather-resistant properties make it an ideal material for roofing systems, contributing to both the aesthetic appeal and longevity of buildings. Copper roofs can last for over a century, making them a cost-effective choice over time despite the higher initial expense.

In terms of plumbing, copper's role is even more significant. About 60% of copper usage in the construction industry is allocated to plumbing. Copper pipes have been a standard in plumbing for decades due to their resistance to corrosion, bacteriostatic properties (which help inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria), and ability to handle extreme temperatures. These attributes ensure safe and reliable transport of potable water, as well as efficient removal of wastewater, making copper indispensable in plumbing systems.

Together, roofing and plumbing contribute significantly to the demand for copper in construction, highlighting the metal's essential role in developing sustainable and durable infrastructure.

"USB 2.0 also added a larger three-byte SPLIT token with a seven-bit hub number, 12 bits of control flags, and a five-bit CRC. This is used to perform split transactions. Rather than tie up the high-bandwidth USB bus sending data to a slower USB device, the nearest high-bandwidth capable hub receives a SPLIT token followed by one or two USB packets at high bandwidth, performs the data transfer at full or low bandwidth, and provides the response at high bandwidth when prompted by a second SPLIT token.",How many bits of control flags did USB 2.0 add?,12 bits,1,NUM,"How many bits of control flags did USB 2.0 add?

Relevant context: USB 2.0 introduced several enhancements over its predecessor, USB 1.1, including improvements in data transfer speeds, support for more complex power management, and additional protocol features. However, when it comes to the specifics of control flags, USB 2.0 itself did not explicitly add new bits of control flags in the sense of redefining control bits within the traditional USB protocol packets.

USB protocol, in general, involves packets structured with certain fields, including start-of-frame, token packets, data packets, and handshake packets, each responsible for different aspects of data transfer and control. Control packets have fields encoded to enable proper communication, data integrity check, and flow control between host and device. 

The enhancements of USB 2.0 were more focused on architectural and data rate improvements, such as the introduction of a new signaling rate of 480 Mbps, known as High Speed, significantly faster than USB 1.1's Full Speed of 12 Mbps, rather than on changes to the fundamental control structure or packet format itself.

One of the significant benefits of USB 2.0 in terms of control was improved flow control techniques to support this higher bandwidth, along with better power management schemes, allowing devices to enter various power states efficiently without requiring additional control flags.

The concept of control flags might be more relevant in other contexts within technology fields where bits are added or redefined to refine protocols or enhance functionalities, such as network protocol headers. In the case of USB, the changes with USB 2.0 were evolutionary regarding performance characteristics and power management improvements rather than an overhaul of control signaling or packet architecture itself.

For more detailed technical exploration, one might refer to the USB 2.0 specification documents, which delineate the specifics of protocol operations and data packet structures, highlighting that while the packet format didn’t change in terms of control flags per se, the overall protocol enhancements contributed to USB’s robustness and adaptability in data communication spheres.",407.0,1524.0,1990,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.528858423233032,1.1039669513702393,6.774788856506348,12 bits,1.0
"Darwin's barnacle studies convinced him that variation arose constantly and not just in response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.",In what year did Darwin begin to work on his evolution theory full-time?,1854,1,NUM,"In what year did Darwin begin to work on his evolution theory full-time?

Relevant context: In 1842, Charles Darwin began to lay the groundwork for his revolutionary theory of evolution. However, it was not until 1854, following a prolonged period of intermittent research and numerous distractions, that he fully dedicated himself to this endeavor. After returning from his voyage aboard HMS Beagle in 1836, Darwin spent years compiling his observations, conducting experiments, and corresponding with other scientists. Despite his exploratory years and early writings on natural selection, it was in 1854 that Darwin resolved to concentrate exclusively on this groundbreaking work. By this time, he had amassed a wealth of data and insights, which he systematically organized to develop his theory of evolution by natural selection. His immersion in this project led to the publication of his seminal work, ""On the Origin of Species,"" in 1859. From 1854 onwards, Darwin's life's work became synonymous with his tireless pursuit to understand and explain the mechanics of evolution, a topic that had occupied his thoughts since his transformative journey on the Beagle.",221.0,1430.0,1711,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,3.6248860359191895,1.2639598846435547,7.129782676696777,1854,1.0
"In 1925, 78.26 rpm was chosen as the standard because of the introduction of the electrically powered synchronous turntable motor. This motor ran at 3600 rpm, such that a 46:1 gear ratio would produce 78.26 rpm. In parts of the world that used 50 Hz current, the standard was 77.92 rpm (3,000 rpm with a 77:2 ratio), which was also the speed at which a strobe disc with 77 lines would ""stand still"" in 50 Hz light (92 lines for 60 Hz). After World War II these records were retroactively known as 78s, to distinguish them from other newer disc record formats. Earlier they were just called records, or when there was a need to distinguish them from cylinders, disc records.",How many rpm did the electrically powered synchronous turanable motor run at?,3600 rpm,1,NUM,"How many rpm did the electrically powered synchronous turanable motor run at?

Relevant context: To understand the operation of electrically powered synchronous turntable motors, it is important to recognize their standard speed settings, which are governed by both the electrical frequency supplied to the motor and the design of the apparatus. Synchronous motors are so named because they operate at a speed directly proportional to the frequency of the electrical current. This speed is determined by the formula:

\[ \text{RPM} = \frac{\text{Frequency (Hz)} \times 60}{\text{Number of Pole Pairs}} \]

In most regions, the standard electrical frequency is either 50 Hz or 60 Hz. For instance, in the United States, where the electric supply frequency is 60 Hz, a typical synchronous turntable motor with a design comprising two pole pairs would naturally run at a speed of 1800 RPM. On the other hand, in areas where the frequency is 50 Hz, such as Europe, the same motor would run at 1500 RPM due to the lower supply frequency.

However, many turntables are specifically designed to operate at more user-friendly revolutions per minute, such as the common playback speeds of 33 1/3 RPM or 45 RPM for vinyl records. This is achieved through the use of belts, pulleys, or gears that reduce the motor's speed to the desired RPM suitable for playing records. Therefore, while the motor itself may operate natively at a higher RPM based on the electrical frequency and its internal construction, turntables use a combination of mechanical components to ensure that the record spins at the correct speed for optimal audio fidelity.

Ultimately, the precise RPM of an electrically powered synchronous turntable motor will depend on the specific design and purpose of the turntable. For basic motor operation, understanding its synchronous speed—determined by the frequency and the pole pair configuration—is crucial. However, to comprehend its application in vinyl playback, one must also consider how this motor speed is translated to the platter's speed.",410.0,1776.0,2247,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.124841690063477,1.2939560413360596,7.8967604637146,3600 rpm,1.0
"In 1931, RCA Victor launched the first commercially available vinyl long-playing record, marketed as program-transcription discs. These revolutionary discs were designed for playback at 33 1⁄3 rpm and pressed on a 30 cm diameter flexible plastic disc, with a duration of about ten minutes playing time per side. RCA Victor's early introduction of a long-play disc was a commercial failure for several reasons including the lack of affordable, reliable consumer playback equipment and consumer wariness during the Great Depression. Because of financial hardships that plagued the recording industry during that period (and RCA's own parched revenues), Victor's long-playing records were discontinued by early 1933.",When did RCA Victor release long play discs?,1931,1,NUM,"When did RCA Victor release long play discs?

Relevant context: RCA Victor, a major player in the music industry during the 20th century, made a significant contribution to the evolution of recorded music with the release of its long play (LP) discs. The LP format was first introduced to the public by Columbia Records in 1948, revolutionizing the way people listened to music due to its extended playtime compared to the then-standard 78 RPM records. The following year, RCA Victor, eager to compete with Columbia’s innovation, launched its own line of long-playing discs in January 1950.

These LPs from RCA Victor were designed to be played at 33⅓ RPM, allowing for greater amounts of music on each side of the disc – typically up to 45 minutes in total, compared to the much shorter durations available on the older format. This allowed artists and composers more freedom to express themselves across a broader canvas of sound. RCA Victor's initial LP catalog included a variety of musical genres, with particular emphasis on classical music, where the extended playtime could accommodate entire symphonies or operas without interruption.

RCA Victor’s entry into the long play market was part of a broader wave of technological innovation in the post-war era, which set the stage for the modern album-oriented music industry. Their LP releases also matched the high fidelity sound that was becoming increasingly popular with audiophiles and music enthusiasts of the era. While Columbia Records was first with the LP format, RCA Victor’s adoption and promotion helped to standardize the 33⅓ RPM speed as the industry norm, fostering the growth of the album as a staple of musical consumption.",334.0,1586.0,1974,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.8678319454193115,4.1218719482421875,10.214467525482178,1931,1.0
"Heitaro Nakajima, who developed an early digital audio recorder within Japan's national public broadcasting organization NHK in 1970, became general manager of Sony's audio department in 1971. His team developed a digital PCM adaptor audio tape recorder using a Betamax video recorder in 1973. After this, in 1974 the leap to storing digital audio on an optical disc was easily made. Sony first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in September 1976. A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a 30 cm disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio (44,100 Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using MFM modulation. In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056 Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and cross-interleaved error correction code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard Compact Disc format in 1980. Technical details of Sony's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd AES Convention, held on 13–16 March 1979, in Brussels. Sony's AES technical paper was published on 1 March 1979. A week later, on 8 March, Philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called ""Philips Introduce Compact Disc"" in Eindhoven, Netherlands.",What year did Sony first exhibit the use of an optical digital audio disc?,1976,1,NUM,"What year did Sony first exhibit the use of an optical digital audio disc?

Relevant context: In 1977, Sony first showcased the use of an optical digital audio disc, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of audio technology. As the digital revolution was beginning to take hold of various industries, Sony stepped into the forefront by introducing what would become a cornerstone of consumer electronics: the optical disc format for digital audio storage. This demonstration occurred in the context of a broader collaboration with Philips, a partnership that was instrumental in the development and eventual commercial release of the compact disc (CD) in the early 1980s.

During this initial exhibition, Sony presented a prototype that highlighted the innovative application of laser technology to read audio data encoded in a digital format onto a shiny, circular disc. This signaled a departure from the analog methods of storing and playing back music, such as vinyl records and cassette tapes. The demonstration showcased the potential for higher sound fidelity, increased durability, and greater storage flexibility that came with digital audio discs.

The technology was still in its nascent stages, requiring further refinement before reaching the mass market. However, this early demonstration established the groundwork for future developments. Sony's venture into digital audio with the optical disc, alongside Philips, eventually led to the standardization of the CD format, which was officially launched in 1982.

This seminal moment in 1977 was not just about the technical capabilities Sony was experimenting with, but was also indicative of the company's forward-thinking approach and its commitment to innovation.

Relevant context: The first cinema theater in Greece opened its doors in the early 20th century, marking a significant moment in the nation's cultural history. In 1907, Athens, the capital city of Greece, witnessed the establishment of the first permanent cinema theater, known as the ""Cine Atrion."" Located in the bustling area of Syntagma Square, which even today remains a focal point of Athenian life, Cine Atrion quickly became a popular destination for locals eager to experience the novel art form that was sweeping across Europe and the world.

Before the establishment of Cine Atrion, traveling cinema shows had occasionally entertained Greek audiences, but these were sporadic and lacked the permanence and regular programming of a dedicated cinema theater. Cine Atrion changed this dynamic by providing a stable venue for film screenings, thus introducing Greek citizens to a more structured way of engaging with film as a new art form. The theater initially featured short films and newsreels, which were immensely popular at the time, given the novelty of moving pictures.

The opening of Cine Atrion was emblematic of the modernization wave influencing Greece in the early 1900s, reflecting broader trends in technology and entertainment that were transforming societies worldwide. This marked the beginning of a rich cinematic tradition in Greece that would eventually produce renowned filmmakers and contribute meaningfully to both European and global cinema landscapes.

"Rejecting offers to direct Jaws 2, King Kong and Superman, Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about UFOs, which became Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, Close Encounters was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other Academy Awards nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, Vilmos Zsigmond, and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, 1941, a big-budgeted World War II farce, was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4 million worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics.",How much did '1941' earn?,over $92.4 million worldwide,1,NUM,"How much did '1941' earn?

Relevant context: Steven Spielberg’s 1979 comedy film ""1941"" faced a mixed reception upon its release, both critically and commercially. Despite being directed by a celebrated filmmaker and featuring a star-studded cast including John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, the movie did not perform as expected at the box office.

Financially, ""1941"" had a production budget estimated to be around $35 million, which was significantly high for the time, reflecting Spielberg’s ambitious vision for the film. However, the movie earned approximately $94.9 million worldwide. In the United States, it grossed about $31.8 million, which was below expectations considering Spielberg's previous successes with blockbuster hits like ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""

The tepid box office performance of ""1941"" is often attributed to its departure from Spielberg’s usual formula and genre, as well as the film’s parodic take on World War II and satire that did not resonate as well with the American audience at the time. Nevertheless, despite the initial underwhelming reception, the film has gained a cult following over the years.

"Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).",What process optimises temperature for chick development?,Incubation,1,NUM,"What process optimises temperature for chick development?

Relevant context: Incubation is the crucial process that optimizes temperature for chick development. This process is primarily managed by the parent bird, often the mother, though in some species, both parents share the responsibility. The optimal temperature for incubating chicken eggs is generally around 99 to 101 degrees Fahrenheit (37.2 to 38.3 degrees Celsius). Maintaining this temperature range ensures the proper development of the embryo inside the egg.

The process begins with the mother bird carefully selecting a nesting site, which must provide protection against the elements and predators. Once the eggs are laid, the parent bird uses its body heat to keep the eggs warm. Birds have a specialized area on their ventral side called a ""brood patch,"" which is featherless and highly vascularized. This patch allows for efficient heat transfer from the adult bird to the eggs.

The incubation period typically lasts about 21 days for chicken eggs, although this can vary slightly depending on species and environmental conditions. During this time, the incubating bird will periodically turn the eggs. This turning is crucial as it prevents the developing embryo from sticking to the eggshell, ensures even heat distribution, and promotes proper development.

In some cases, such as in a controlled laboratory or farming environment, artificial incubators are used to optimize the temperature for chick development. These devices simulate the conditions provided by a brooding parent. They ensure a consistent temperature and often include a mechanism for automatically turning the eggs at regular intervals.

Humidity also plays a key role during incubation, with the ideal range being 50-55% relative humidity for the first 18 days, then increasing to about 65-70% during the final days before hatching. Proper humidity levels prevent dehydration of the embryos and ensure successful hatching.

In summary, incubation is the natural or artificial process that optimizes temperature for embryonic development in birds. It involves carefully controlled conditions including temperature, humidity, and egg turning, all of which are crucial to the successful development and hatching of healthy chicks.",414.0,1808.0,2277,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.759793281555176,1.1869640350341797,9.138712644577026,Incubation,1.0
"There have been two major trends in the changing status of pet dogs. The first has been the 'commodification' of the dog, shaping it to conform to human expectations of personality and behaviour. The second has been the broadening of the concept of the family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.",How many big trends are involved in how much the position of dogs has changed in human civilization?,two,1,NUM,"How many big trends are involved in how much the position of dogs has changed in human civilization?

Relevant context: The evolution of the dog's position in human civilization can be understood through several major trends, each highlighting a significant shift in the role and perception of dogs over time. These trends shed light on how dogs have transitioned from wild animals to integral companions in human society.

The first major trend is domestication itself, which began thousands of years ago and set the foundation for the dog's evolving relationship with humans. The initial process of selecting and breeding wolves that displayed less aggressive and more cooperative behaviors led to the emergence of early dog breeds. This marked a pivotal change, where dogs started to be viewed not as threats, but as potential helpers and early partners in hunting and protection.

The second trend focuses on the role of dogs as working animals. As human societies became more complex, dogs were selectively bred and trained for specific roles. This includes herding livestock, guarding property, and pulling sleds. These roles were crucial in pastoral and agrarian societies, where dogs were seen not only as helpers but as vital contributors to the economic and social structures of communities.

A third trend is the emergence of dogs as companions, largely taking place during the industrialization and urbanization of the 19th and 20th centuries. This period saw a significant rise in the popularity of dogs as household pets. With changes in lifestyle and an increase in leisure time, the emotional bond between humans and dogs deepened. Dogs began to be valued for their companionship rather than just their utility. The rise of purebred dog shows and canine-related hobbies also contributed to a cultural shift where dogs were celebrated and cherished for their appearance and companionship.

The fourth trend is the modern movement towards recognizing dogs as family members and sentient beings with emotional and psychological needs. This is closely tied to the advent of animal rights movements and advancements in veterinary science. Today, dogs are often considered family members, and there is a growing emphasis on their well-being, including their mental health and quality of life. This trend reflects broader societal shifts towards a more empathetic and caring approach to animals in general.

In summary, the changing position of dogs in human civilization has been shaped by four major trends: domestication and early partnerships, specialized roles as working animals, the rise of dogs as companions, and the recent focus on dogs as family members and sentient beings. Each trend illustrates the dynamic and evolving nature of the human-dog relationship, reflecting broader changes in society's values, lifestyles, and ethical considerations.",509.0,1400.0,1973,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.416773080825806,1.5799503326416016,10.24868655204773,Two trends,0.5
"Another significant issue unique to LaserDisc is one involving the inconsistency of playback quality between different makers and models of player. On most televisions, a given DVD player will produce a picture that is visually indistinguishable from other units. Differences in image quality between players only becomes easily apparent on large televisions and substantial leaps in image quality are generally only obtained with expensive, high-end players that allow for post-processing of the MPEG-2 stream during playback. In contrast, LaserDisc playback quality is highly dependent on hardware quality. Major variances in picture quality appear between different makers and models of LD players, even when tested on a low to mid-range television. The obvious benefits of using high quality equipment has helped keep demand for some players high, thus also keeping pricing for those units comparably high. In the 1990s, notable players sold for anywhere from US$200 to well over $1,000, while older and less desirable players could be purchased in working condition for as little as $25.",How cheaply could an older LaserDisc player be purchased in the 1990s?,$25,1,NUM,"How cheaply could an older LaserDisc player be purchased in the 1990s?

Relevant context: In the 1990s, purchasing an older model of a LaserDisc player could be quite economical, especially in comparison to newer models or other evolving technologies of the time. By the mid-1990s, as newer digital video formats like DVD were beginning to emerge, older LaserDisc players were often found at discounted prices in various outlets.

Typically, an older LaserDisc player, depending on the brand and features, could be purchased for anywhere from $150 to $300. This price range was influenced significantly by the condition of the device, the manufacturer, and whether it included any extra features like digital sound processing capabilities or advanced playback options. For instance, a basic model from less sought-after brands might be acquired for around $150 to $200. On the other hand, models from leading manufacturers such as Pioneer, which had stronger reputations and usually offered more robust and reliable performance, might sell for closer to $250 to $300, even if they were older.

Additionally, the marketplace where one sought to purchase a LaserDisc player also impacted the prices. Major electronics retailers, particularly those maintaining or liquidating inventory of older models, could sometimes offer promotions or discounts to clear shelf space. However, bargain hunters often found the best deals through second-hand shops, garage sales, or burgeoning online marketplaces like eBay, which was launched in the mid-'90s. In these settings, prices might dip even further, sometimes under $150, particularly if the seller was unaware of the player’s market value or was eager to sell quickly.

Overall, while LaserDisc players initially represented a premium home entertainment choice in the 1980s, by the 1990s, they became much more accessible for thrifty consumers willing to opt for older models.

"Genes are regulated so that they are expressed only when the product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources.:7 A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its internal environment (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its specific role if in a multicellular organism. Gene expression can be regulated at any step: from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, to post-translational modification of the protein. The regulation of lactose metabolism genes in E. coli (lac operon) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961.",When are genes expressed?,only when the product is needed,1,NUM,"When are genes expressed?

Relevant context: Genes are expressed when specific conditions within a cell or organism allow for the transcription and translation of genetic information into proteins or functional RNA molecules. This process primarily occurs during certain stages of the cell cycle but is intricately regulated by multiple factors including environmental signals, developmental cues, and cellular needs.

In eukaryotic organisms, gene expression is often initiated in response to external stimuli such as nutrient availability, stress conditions, or signaling molecules that activate specific proteins, such as transcription factors. These transcription factors bind to promoter regions upstream of genes and facilitate the recruitment of RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for synthesizing messenger RNA (mRNA).

Gene expression is also regulated through epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, which alter chromatin structure and accessibility. For example, highly condensed chromatin (heterochromatin) is generally associated with inactive genes, whereas loosely packed chromatin (euchromatin) is correlated with active gene transcription.

During specific stages of an organism’s development, certain sets of genes are turned on or off to guide differentiation and growth processes. In multicellular organisms, gene expression patterns vary between different cell types, allowing for cellular specialization. For instance, liver cells express genes necessary for detoxification that are not expressed in neurons.

On a cellular level, gene expression is also responsive to the cell cycle. During DNA replication in the S-phase, genes required for DNA synthesis are expressed, while during the G1 phase, genes promoting cell growth are active. In contrast, many genes are downregulated during mitosis to ensure that cellular division proceeds without interference.

Furthermore, the longevity and efficiency of gene expression are controlled post-transcriptionally, involving processes like RNA splicing, transport, stability, and translation. For instance, microRNAs can bind to mRNA molecules to suppress their translation or lead to their degradation.

Overall, gene expression is a complex and dynamic process influenced by myriad factors that ensure precise control over which genes are active and when, thus orchestrating the diverse functions necessary for life at the cellular and organismal levels.",423.0,1493.0,1966,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,3.893878698348999,1.422957181930542,6.64179253578186,When needed,0.8
"Over the course of thousands of years, American indigenous peoples domesticated, bred and cultivated a large array of plant species. These species now constitute 50–60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide. In certain cases, the indigenous peoples developed entirely new species and strains through artificial selection, as was the case in the domestication and breeding of maize from wild teosinte grasses in the valleys of southern Mexico. Numerous such agricultural products retain their native names in the English and Spanish lexicons.",How were new species and strains of crops developed?,artificial selection,1,NUM,"How were new species and strains of crops developed?

Relevant context: Developing new species and strains of crops is a complex process that has evolved over centuries, combining both traditional practices and modern scientific techniques to enhance agricultural productivity, sustainability, and nutritional value. Initially, the development of new crop varieties relied on natural selection and primitive forms of hybridization. Early farmers would selectively breed plants by choosing to propagate seeds from plants that demonstrated desirable traits, such as higher yields, better taste, or increased resistance to drought and disease.

As agricultural knowledge advanced, so did the methods for developing new crop varieties. The discovery of the principles of genetics by Gregor Mendel in the 19th century laid the foundation for more systematic and scientific approaches. Crossbreeding, or the intentional mating of plants with different traits to produce offspring with specific desired characteristics, became a common practice. For instance, hybrid corn, which is produced by crossbreeding two carefully selected parent lines, significantly boosts yields compared to traditional corn varieties.

Modern crop development has been revolutionized by biotechnological techniques. One of the monumental advancements was the introduction of genetic engineering in the latter part of the 20th century, which allows for the direct manipulation of an organism's DNA. This method can introduce new genes into a plant, giving it novel properties such as pest resistance or improved nutritional content. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) like Bt cotton and herbicide-resistant soybeans are results of such efforts, targeted to address specific agricultural challenges.

Additionally, techniques like marker-assisted selection (MAS) have accelerated the breeding process. MAS utilizes molecular markers linked to desirable traits to screen and select plants that carry those traits, even before the plant expresses them physically. This precision breeding reduces the time required to develop a new cultivar, making the process more efficient and reliable.

In recent years, the advent of technologies like CRISPR-Cas9, a powerful genome-editing tool, has taken crop development to a new level. It allows scientists to precisely edit the genome, enhancing traits or removing undesirable ones with unprecedented accuracy. This has opened possibilities for enhancing climate resilience, improving disease resistance, and increasing nutritional content without introducing foreign DNA, a significant concern with traditional GMO methods.

While each of these techniques has contributed enormously to agricultural improvement, they also bring challenges and controversies, including ethical considerations, regulatory aspects, and public perception. Nonetheless, the ongoing development of new crop species and strains continues to be a crucial element in addressing global food security and adapting to changing environmental conditions.",504.0,1436.0,1995,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,4.796853065490723,1.2209725379943848,7.286776304244995,Artificial selection,1.0
"The emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon. Emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug. For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the Luria–Delbrück experiment. Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains.",When was the Luria-Delbruck experiment?,1943,1,NUM,"When was the Luria-Delbruck experiment?

Relevant context: The Luria-Delbrück experiment, also known as the fluctuation test, was conducted in 1943 by Salvador Luria and Max Delbrück. This groundbreaking experiment was pivotal in the field of genetics and microbiology as it provided compelling evidence supporting the mutation theory of evolution over the previously dominant adaptation theory.

In the 1940s, scientists were debating whether bacterial resistance to phages (viruses that infect bacteria) was the result of spontaneous mutations or an adaptive response. Luria and Delbrück designed an ingenious experiment to resolve this question. They cultured Escherichia coli bacteria in multiple separate test tubes and then exposed them to a bacteriophage. By analyzing the distribution of resistant bacteria across the different cultures, they observed a wide variation in the number of resistant colonies, consistent with the random mutation hypothesis. This result demonstrated that resistance in bacteria arose from random mutations present before exposure to the phage, rather than being induced by it.

Published in 1943, their findings not only provided evidence for the role of mutations in evolution but also laid the groundwork for modern molecular biology by establishing bacteria as a model system for genetic studies. The Luria-Delbrück experiment remains a classic example of how statistical methods can be applied to biological questions, highlighting the importance of chance in evolutionary processes.",277.0,1745.0,2077,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.9558773040771484,1.3979613780975342,6.662809133529663,1943,1.0

"The polarization of an antenna refers to the orientation of the electric field (E-plane) of the radio wave with respect to the Earth's surface and is determined by the physical structure of the antenna and by its orientation; note that this designation is totally distinct from the antenna's directionality. Thus, a simple straight wire antenna will have one polarization when mounted vertically, and a different polarization when mounted horizontally. As a transverse wave, the magnetic field of a radio wave is at right angles to that of the electric field, but by convention, talk of an antenna's ""polarization"" is understood to refer to the direction of the electric field.",How many polarizations will a antenna have when mounted vertically?,one,1,NUM,"How many polarizations will a antenna have when mounted vertically?

Relevant context: When considering the number of polarizations an antenna will have when mounted vertically, it's essential to understand the concept of polarization in electromagnetic wave propagation. Polarization refers to the orientation of the electric field vector of the waves emitted by the antenna. 

For antennas mounted vertically, typically, the polarization is described as vertical polarization. This means that the electric field of the electromagnetic waves radiates in a direction parallel to the vertical axis. Vertical polarization is common in many communication systems, such as those for broadcast television and FM radio, where the transmitting antennas are often mounted vertically so that the signals can be easily received by both stationary and mobile receivers.

However, the number of polarizations is generally determined by the type of antenna and its design. A simple monopole or dipole antenna, when mounted vertically, will primarily have one polarization—vertical. This vertical polarization is efficient for communicating with antennas similarly oriented, minimizing signal loss due to polarization mismatch.

It's also important to note that some advanced antennas can support multiple polarizations, such as circular or dual-polarization, through design aspects like phased arrays or specialized feed systems. These antennas can emit and receive signals with more than one polarization, making them versatile for various applications, including those involving complex signal environments or multi-path propagation.

In conclusion, a vertically mounted antenna typically has one primary polarization—vertical. However, specific design and engineering modifications can enable an antenna to handle multiple polarizations, making it adaptable to diverse communication requirements.

The atmosphere is typically charged with energy, as music blares from the sound system, often a signature entrance theme that embodies the wrestler's persona and style. The lights may dim or flash in time with the music, creating a visual spectacle designed to captivate the audience. 

The wrestler often emerges from a curtain or entryway, usually accompanied by cheers or boos from the crowd, depending on their role as a 'face' (heroic character) or 'heel' (villainous character). This moment is crucial, as it establishes the wrestler's connection with the audience, showcasing their charisma and showmanship. They might pause momentarily at the entrance, posing or acknowledging the fans, perhaps with a trademark gesture or tagline shouted into the air.

As the wrestler makes their way down the aisle toward the ring, they may interact with the audience, exchanging high-fives with fans, or taunting and engaging verbally with detractors.

Relevant context: The relationship between the number of base pairs in an organism’s genome and the total complement of genes it possesses is known as the ""gene density"" of that species. Gene density is a crucial concept in genomics and evolutionary biology, as it helps scientists understand not only the overall structure and organization of a genome but also the evolutionary pressure on an organism’s genetic material.

Gene density is often expressed as the number of genes per million base pairs (genes/Mb). Organisms with high gene density have a greater number of genes packed into each million base pairs of DNA, whereas those with low gene density have fewer genes within the same genomic span. This metric can vary widely among different species.

For instance, prokaryotic organisms, such as bacteria, typically exhibit high gene densities with relatively compact genomes, often containing little non-coding DNA. Their streamlined genomes are an evolutionary adaptation to maintain efficiency in replication and cellular function. On the other hand, eukaryotic organisms, especially complex multicellular ones like plants and animals, may have lower gene densities. Their genomes often contain large amounts of non-coding DNA, including introns within genes, regulatory sequences, and repetitive elements, which serves various roles like gene regulation and chromosomal stability.

In some cases, closely related species can have vastly different gene densities. This can be a reflection of different evolutionary strategies or adaptations to distinct environmental pressures. An understanding of gene density can provide insights into how genomes are organized and have evolved, offering clues about the complexity and adaptability of different life forms.

It is important to note that gene density is just one way to assess genomic features. While it gives a snapshot of how tightly packed genes are within the genome, it does not necessarily correlate with organismal complexity, intelligence, or phenotypic diversity. The relationship between the number of base pairs and the total gene complement underscores the intricate balance of genomic content, evolutionary history, and functional requirements that shape the life strategies of various species.",416.0,1197.0,1678,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.074881315231323,1.1626472473144531,7.350535869598389,Genome size,0.5

Communication is two-way process not merely one-way.",When does language learning primarily occur most intensively?,during human childhood,1,NUM,"When does language learning primarily occur most intensively?

Relevant context: Language learning primarily occurs most intensively during early childhood, often considered to be the period from birth to around age 7. This crucial developmental window is characterized by rapid cognitive growth and heightened neural plasticity, which make it an optimal time for language acquisition.

During the first few years of life, infants are particularly adept at distinguishing and processing the phonetic sounds of their native language. By around six months of age, they begin to babble, experimenting with sounds that will form the basis of words. As infants grow into toddlers, their vocabularies expand at an astonishing rate. It is not uncommon for children to learn new words at an exponential pace, sometimes acquiring several words a day and starting to form simple sentences by the age of two.

Research suggests that during this period, the brain's neural circuits are extremely receptive to linguistic input. This is partly due to the brain's synaptic density, which peaks during childhood, allowing for robust connections to be formed based on the stimuli the child encounters. Children are especially sensitive to the social context of language and learn best through interactions with caregivers and peers, making immersion in a rich linguistic environment crucial.

This intense period of language learning extends into the early school years, during which children continue to refine their understanding of grammar, syntax, and more complex language structures. By the time they are around 6 or 7, most children have a solid grasp of their native language, though they continue to develop literacy skills, vocabulary, and more sophisticated linguistic abilities throughout their adolescence.

While the critical period for primary language acquisition is generally considered to end around puberty, with the closing of certain neurological windows, language learning does not stop.

Relevant context: In the realm of financial markets, particularly within the context of credit insurance, a form of financial instrument known as credit default swaps is commonly referenced. The abbreviation for credit default swaps is ""CDS."" CDS are a type of derivative that allows an investor to ""swap"" or offset their credit risk with that of another investor. In essence, a CDS is akin to an insurance policy—a buyer can pay a premium to a seller in exchange for protection against the loss of principal due to a borrower's default. 

For example, if an investor holds a bond and is concerned about the issuer's ability to continue making payments, they can purchase a CDS. If the issuer defaults, the CDS seller compensates the buyer for the loss. If no default occurs, the seller earns a profit from the premium.

CDS were widely used leading up to and during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, which highlighted both their utility and their potential risks when not properly managed.

"There are a number of aids available to pilots, though not all airports are equipped with them. A visual approach slope indicator (VASI) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. Some airports are equipped with a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a distance measuring equipment (DME) to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an instrument landing system (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. The number of instrument approaches based on the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is rapidly increasing and may eventually be the primary means for instrument landings.",What does VOR stand for?,VHF omnidirectional range,2,ABBR,"What does VOR stand for?

Relevant context: VOR stands for ""VHF Omnidirectional Range."" It is a type of radio navigation system for aircraft, providing pilots with a way to determine their position and stay on course. The VOR system uses a network of fixed ground-based radio beacons that transmit very high frequency (VHF) radio signals. These signals are picked up by the aircraft's VOR receiver, which interprets the direction to or from the beacon in terms of a radial.

The VOR system was introduced in the early 1950s and became the standard system for short- and medium-range navigation. It allows for precise navigation by providing both a direction to a particular VOR station and a geographical line of position along which the station lies. VOR beacons are typically situated at strategic locations such as airports and air corridors to guide aircraft along established airways.

Each VOR station transmits two signals: a constant reference signal in all directions, and a variable directional signal that rotates at a predetermined rate. By comparing the phase difference between these two signals, an aircraft's VOR receiver calculates a radial, or direction, from the station to the aircraft. Pilots use this information, in conjunction with a map, to navigate the skies.

Modern aviation still relies on VOR for routing and navigation, although GPS has become more prevalent. Despite this, VOR remains a critical backup system and is used worldwide for air traffic control and safe airplane navigation. Understanding and using VOR is an essential skill for pilots, covering topics such as tuning the receiver, interpreting readings, and understanding limitations like signal interference and line-of-sight constraints.",334.0,1482.0,1872,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.729383707046509,1.2406840324401855,6.228138446807861,VHF omnidirectional range,1.0

"Armies typically have air defence in depth, from integral MANPADS such as the RBS 70, Stinger and Igla at smaller force levels up to army-level missile defence systems such as Angara and Patriot. Often, the high-altitude long-range missile systems force aircraft to fly at low level, where anti-aircraft guns can bring them down. As well as the small and large systems, for effective air defence there must be intermediate systems. These may be deployed at regiment-level and consist of platoons of self-propelled anti-aircraft platforms, whether they are self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (SPAAGs), integrated air-defence systems like Tunguska or all-in-one surface-to-air missile platforms like Roland or SA-8 Gecko.",What does SPAAG stand for?,self-propelled anti-aircraft guns,2,ABBR,"What does SPAAG stand for?

Relevant context: SPAAG stands for ""Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun."" This term refers to a type of mobile, autonomous military vehicle equipped with automatic anti-aircraft guns designed to target and destroy enemy aircraft. The SPAAG is characterized by its ability to move independently across various terrains while providing air defense to ground forces. Typically, these vehicles are mounted on armored chassis, often similar to those of tanks or armored personnel carriers, thus allowing them to accompany frontline troops and offer protection against aerial threats in dynamic combat scenarios.

The primary role of SPAAGs is to engage low-flying aircraft, helicopters, and, at times, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), using radar-guided or visually aimed artillery systems. They became particularly prominent during the mid-20th century when air power began to play a more significant role in warfare, necessitating mobile and adaptable air defense solutions.

Notable examples of SPAAG systems include the German Gepard, the Soviet/Russian ZSU-23-4 Shilka, and the American M42 Duster. These systems generally feature multiple-barrel guns to maximize firing rate and effectiveness, and they often incorporate advanced radar systems that can track and engage targets automatically. Over time, the SPAAG has evolved, with many modern systems now integrating capabilities to fire surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), providing a more comprehensive air defense solution. The addition of such systems ensures these vehicles can counter not only aircraft but also airborne precision-guided munitions, missiles, and drones, making them versatile components of contemporary military forces.",321.0,1499.0,1878,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.194085359573364,1.7300734519958496,7.208414793014526,Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun,0.8
"Early recommendations for the quantity of water required for maintenance of good health suggested that 6–8 glasses of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration. However the notion that a person should consume eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source. The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council read: ""An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods."" More recent comparisons of well-known recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good health. Therefore, to help standardize guidelines, recommendations for water consumption are included in two recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary guidelines and (ii) Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes (ADI). These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with “desirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed.” For healthful hydration, the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water intakes of 2.0 L/day for adult females and 2.5 L/day for adult males. These reference values include water from drinking water, other beverages, and from food. About 80% of our daily water requirement comes from the beverages we drink, with the remaining 20% coming from food. Water content varies depending on the type of food consumed, with fruit and vegetables containing more than cereals, for example. These values are estimated using country-specific food balance sheets published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Other guidelines for nutrition also have implications for the beverages we consume for healthy hydration- for example, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that added sugars should represent no more than 10% of total energy intake.",What does ADI stand for?,adequate daily intakes,2,ABBR,"What does ADI stand for?

Relevant context: ADI can stand for several different things depending on the context in which it is used. One of the most common meanings of ADI is ""Acceptable Daily Intake,"" a term used in the field of food safety and toxicology. The Acceptable Daily Intake refers to the maximum amount of a particular substance, such as a food additive or pesticide residue, that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without posing a significant risk to health. This measure is typically expressed in milligrams of substance per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg bw/day) and is established by regulatory agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) after extensive scientific evaluation.

Another common use of ADI is ""Analog Devices, Inc.,"" which is an American multinational corporation specializing in the design and manufacturing of semiconductor products used in a broad array of applications. Founded in 1965, Analog Devices, Inc. is particularly known for its data conversion and signal processing technology. This company is a significant player in the electronics industry, contributing to innovations in areas such as communications, healthcare, automotive, and defense.

In the business world, ADI may also refer to ""Area of Dominant Influence,"" a term used in the broadcasting industry to define a region where the population can receive the same television and radio station offerings. ADI regions are important for determining market areas for advertisers.

GNIpc: Gross national income at purchasing power parity per capita",What does GNIpc stand for?,Gross national income at purchasing power parity per capita,2,ABBR,"What does GNIpc stand for?

Relevant context: GNIpc stands for ""Gross National Income per capita."" It is an economic metric used to assess the average income of a country's citizens and residents. Gross National Income (GNI) is the total domestic and foreign output claimed by residents of a country, consisting of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) plus net factor income from abroad (such as interest and dividends). To obtain the per capita figure, the GNI is divided by the population size of the country.

GNI per capita is often used as an indicator of the economic health of a country and to compare living standards across different nations. It provides a more comprehensive view of income than GDP per capita by taking into account income received from abroad. This can be particularly important for countries that receive a significant portion of their income from citizens working overseas or foreign investments.

International organizations, such as the World Bank and the United Nations, frequently use GNIpc to classify countries into income categories, such as low-income, lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income, and high-income economies. The data derived from GNI per capita help policymakers, economists, and researchers understand economic performance, identify developmental needs, and allocate resources more effectively.

"Drug discovery and development is very expensive; of all compounds investigated for use in humans only a small fraction are eventually approved in most nations by government appointed medical institutions or boards, who have to approve new drugs before they can be marketed in those countries. In 2010 18 NMEs (New Molecular Entities) were approved and three biologics by the FDA, or 21 in total, which is down from 26 in 2009 and 24 in 2008. On the other hand, there were only 18 approvals in total in 2007 and 22 back in 2006. Since 2001, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has averaged 22.9 approvals a year. This approval comes only after heavy investment in pre-clinical development and clinical trials, as well as a commitment to ongoing safety monitoring. Drugs which fail part-way through this process often incur large costs, while generating no revenue in return. If the cost of these failed drugs is taken into account, the cost of developing a successful new drug (new chemical entity, or NCE), has been estimated at about 1.3 billion USD(not including marketing expenses). Professors Light and Lexchin reported in 2012, however, that the rate of approval for new drugs has been a relatively stable average rate of 15 to 25 for decades.",What does NMEs stand for?,New Molecular Entities,2,ABBR,"What does NMEs stand for?

Relevant context: NMEs is an abbreviation that stands for ""New Molecular Entities."" In the context of pharmaceuticals and drug development, New Molecular Entities refer to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that have not been previously approved by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA). NMEs are typically characterized by their unique chemical structures and novel mechanisms of action, which distinguish them from existing marketed drugs.

The significance of NMEs lies in their potential to provide new therapeutic options for patients, addressing unmet medical needs and offering alternatives for diseases with limited or no treatment options. The development of NMEs is a complex and costly process, involving rigorous research, preclinical testing, and clinical trials to ensure their safety and efficacy before they can be approved for marketing.

Each year, the FDA approves several NMEs, which are seen as indicators of innovation within the pharmaceutical industry. They often represent breakthroughs in the treatment of complex conditions, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and rare genetic disorders. NMEs can also contribute to advances in fields like personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to the genetic makeup of individual patients.

"The Mantoux tuberculin skin test is often used to screen people at high risk for TB. Those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs), on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.","What does ""IGRAs"" stand for?",Interferon gamma release assays,2,ABBR,"What does ""IGRAs"" stand for?

Relevant context: IGRAs stands for Interferon Gamma Release Assays. These are blood tests used primarily to detect latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) by measuring the immune system's response to the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. When someone is exposed to the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, their immune cells, if they’ve previously been sensitized, will release interferon-gamma (a type of protein) in response to specific antigens present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

There are two main types of IGRAs currently in use: the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test and the T-SPOT.TB test. Both tests involve drawing a blood sample, which is then exposed to TB-specific antigens. The amount of interferon-gamma released in response is quantified and used to determine whether the person has been infected with the tuberculosis bacteria. One significant advantage of IGRAs over the traditional Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) is their higher specificity and sensitivity, particularly in individuals who have been vaccinated with the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine or who may not return for a TST reading.

IGRAs are widely used in public health settings for screening healthcare workers, individuals from high-prevalence areas, and others at increased risk of latent TB infection. While they are effective for diagnosing LTBI, they are not used to diagnose active tuberculosis, which requires further evaluation and additional testing, such as sputum culture or chest X-rays. The use of IGRAs in detecting TB infection helps reduce the risk of latent infections developing into active diseases, thereby supporting TB control programs worldwide.",342.0,1409.0,1810,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.940659284591675,1.4390435218811035,6.614290475845337,Interferon gamma release assays,1.0

"For customers with more demanding requirements (such as medium-to-large businesses, or other ISPs) can use higher-speed DSL (such as single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line), Ethernet, metropolitan Ethernet, gigabit Ethernet, Frame Relay, ISDN Primary Rate Interface, ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and synchronous optical networking (SONET).",what does atm stand for in relation to internet providers? ,Asynchronous Transfer Mode,2,ABBR,"what does atm stand for in relation to internet providers? 

Relevant context: ATM, in the context of internet providers, stands for Asynchronous Transfer Mode. It is a network technology that was widely used in the past, primarily during the late 1990s and early 2000s, to facilitate the transfer of data across wide area networks (WANs) and local area networks (LANs). Asynchronous Transfer Mode is a cell-based switching technology that utilizes fixed-size packets, known as cells, to transmit data. Each cell in ATM is comprised of a 5-byte header and a 48-byte payload, totaling 53 bytes.

One of the key advantages of ATM is its ability to handle different types of traffic such as voice, video, and data on the same network infrastructure due to its fixed-size cells, which allow for efficient and predictable data transfer rates. This makes ATM particularly useful for multimedia applications where consistent quality of service (QoS) is important. The technology supports multiple levels of QoS, enabling service differentiation for various types of internet traffic.

ATM uses a connection-oriented model in which a virtual circuit is established between the two end points prior to data transfer. This model provides reliable and efficient communication, often necessary for real-time applications. Although ATM was a highly influential technology and played a critical role in the development of broadband internet services, it has largely been superseded by other technologies such as Ethernet and Internet Protocol-based (IP) networks. These newer technologies offer greater flexibility and cost-effectiveness, leading to a decline in the use of ATM.

Despite its decreased prevalence in modern internet networks, many telecommunications providers continue to use aspects of ATM technology, especially in backbone networks where legacy systems are still operational. Its architecture and principles also laid the groundwork for future developments in internet technologies, contributing significantly to the evolution of high-speed data networks. Understanding ATM is key to appreciating the historical context and technological advancements that have shaped today's internet services.",390.0,1443.0,1891,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.1433258056640625,1.2429873943328857,8.004715919494629,Asynchronous Transfer Mode,1.0
"The World Bank reported in February 2009 that the Arab World was far less severely affected by the credit crunch. With generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits, such as remittances, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or foreign aid, Arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008. This group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks. They entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions. This gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn. The greatest impact of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices, which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance. Steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments. Significantly lower oil prices could cause a reversal of economic performance as has been the case in past oil shocks. Initial impact will be seen on public finances and employment for foreign workers.",What does the abbreviation FDI stand for?,Foreign Direct Investment,2,ABBR,"What does the abbreviation FDI stand for?

Relevant context: The abbreviation FDI stands for Foreign Direct Investment. This term is used to describe an investment made by a company or individual from one country into business interests located in another country. FDI typically involves establishing business operations or acquiring business assets in the foreign country, such as ownership or controlling interest in a local company. It is distinguished from portfolio investment, which involves investing in financial markets without direct management or control over the business.

Foreign Direct Investment is a crucial factor in global economic integration, as it often leads to the transfer of technology, expertise, and capital between countries. It can stimulate local economies by creating jobs, building infrastructure, and enhancing the skills of the local workforce. FDI can take two primary forms: horizontal FDI, where a company invests in the same business operations in a foreign country, and vertical FDI, where investment is made in different stages of production in a foreign country, such as manufacturing, distribution, or sales.

Governments worldwide often seek to attract FDI by offering incentives such as tax breaks, relaxed regulations, and investment grants, as it is seen as a way to foster economic development and increase global competitiveness. However, FDI can also lead to concerns about loss of domestic control over critical industries and can have socioeconomic and environmental impacts that need to be managed carefully.

For example, an American automobile company building a factory in India to manufacture cars specifically for the Asian market is an instance of FDI. In this scenario, the automobile company not only invests the capital needed to build and operate the factory but also transfers managerial practices, technology, and skills, thereby potentially boosting employment and contributing to the host country's economy.",340.0,1429.0,1824,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.38698673248291,1.5249528884887695,7.025957107543945,Foreign Direct Investment,1.0
"The relieved British began to assess the impact of the Blitz in August 1941, and the RAF Air Staff used the German experience to improve Bomber Command's offensives. They concluded bombers should strike a single target each night and use more incendiaries because they had a greater impact on production than high explosives. They also noted regional production was severely disrupted when city centres were devastated through the loss of administrative offices, utilities and transport. They believed the Luftwaffe had failed in precision attack, and concluded the German example of area attack using incendiaries was the way forward for operations over Germany.",What did the experience of German's using incendiaries mean?,using incendiaries was the way forward for operations over Germany.,2,DESC,"What did the experience of German's using incendiaries mean?

Relevant context: The use of incendiaries by the Germans, particularly during World War II, carried significant strategic and psychological implications. Incendiary bombs, designed to cause fires upon impact, became a staple in the German Luftwaffe's bombing campaigns. The experience of utilizing these weapons had several layers of meaning, both for the attackers and the communities on the receiving end.

For the German military, incendiaries were part of a broader strategy to devastate enemy infrastructure and morale. By setting entire areas ablaze, they could effectively disrupt industrial production and supply chains. Cities like London during the Blitz suffered tremendously from these attacks, with fire becoming as much a weapon of war as the bomb itself. The psychological impact on the civilian population was profound; witnessing one's city engulfed in flames was terrifying and contributed to a sense of helplessness among the populace.

From an operational perspective, using incendiaries meant a shift in tactics. These weapons were often deployed in conjunction with high-explosive bombs, which would first destroy water mains and infrastructure that might be used to combat fires. This synergistic approach highlights the calculated ruthlessness of the strategy.

The experience also had a reciprocal aspect, as the Allies ultimately adopted similar tactics with their own bombing campaigns against German cities. This tit-for-tat approach illustrates how the use of incendiaries reshaped the conduct of aerial warfare, pushing it toward total war—a war not only waged against opposing armies but entire societal structures.

In a broader context, the German deployment of incendiaries foreshadowed later ethical debates about the morality of targeting civilian populations and infrastructure. It raised questions that would echo throughout the 20th century about where to draw the line in the conduct of war. The devastation caused by incendiaries underscored the potential for technology to amplify the horrors of conflict, making it not just a military success but a moral quandary that influenced future international policies on warfare.",394.0,1565.0,2016,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,4.962529182434082,1.0827367305755615,7.3612189292907715,Area attack,0.5
"According to Martin Heidegger we do not exist inside time, we are time. Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of having been, which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes ""being ahead of oneself"" when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended. We are not stuck in sequential time. We are able to remember the past and project into the future—we have a kind of random access to our representation of temporal existence; we can, in our thoughts, step out of (ecstasis) sequential time.","According to Heidegger, what can we do, in our thoughts?",step out of (ecstasis) sequential time.,2,DESC,"According to Heidegger, what can we do, in our thoughts?

Relevant context: In addressing what we can do in our thoughts according to Martin Heidegger, it is essential to delve into his fundamental philosophies, primarily surrounding his concept of ""thinking"" as described in works such as ""What Is Called Thinking?"" Heidegger invites us to engage in a type of reflective thinking that is markedly different from everyday calculative or instrumental thought. He distinguishes between calculative thinking, which he describes as the type of thinking we use for planning and organizing to achieve a particular goal, and meditative thinking, which is more open-ended and exploratory.

For Heidegger, the true essence of thinking involves an openness to being — a readiness to engage with the profound questions of existence and our place in the world. He encourages us to move beyond conventional or surface-level understanding to dwell more deeply on the nature of reality itself. This involves questioning the essence of our existence, the meaning of being, and the fundamental structures that underlie our understanding of the world.

Furthermore, Heidegger suggests that our thoughts should remain connected to our lived experience and the world we inhabit. In doing so, we cultivate a mindfulness and awareness that allows us to uncover deeper truths and insights about the human condition. He posits that this form of thinking is not merely a cognitive process but is deeply intertwined with our being-in-the-world (Dasein), which demands authenticity and a genuine confrontation with the complexities of life.

To think, in Heidegger's view, is to be fundamentally attuned and responsive to the unfolding of being itself. We are invited to think not just with our minds, but with our entire being, embracing both the clarity and ambiguity that accompany our search for understanding. This approach to thinking is a continual process of questioning, where each question leads to new layers of inquiry, reflection, and insight.

Heidegger's perspective challenges us to recognize that our capacity to think is not merely a tool for solving problems but is an essential aspect of how we engage with and make sense of the world. Through this profound form of thought, we can navigate the tensions and mysteries of existence, using our capacity for reflection not only to understand but also to transform our experience of being alive.",449.0,1551.0,2058,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.567158937454224,1.2949600219726562,8.212077617645264,Abstract,0.0
"Gesamtschulen might put bright working class students at risk according to several studies. It could be shown that an achievement gap opens between working class students attending a comprehensive and their middle class peers. Also working class students attending a Gymnasium or a Realschule outperform students from similar backgrounds attending a comprehensive. However it is not students attending a comprehensive, but students attending a Hauptschule, who perform the poorest.",From what group does an achievement gap separate working class students at comprehensive schools?,middle class peers,2,DESC,"From what group does an achievement gap separate working class students at comprehensive schools?

Relevant context: The achievement gap is a well-documented phenomenon in educational research, marking the disparity in academic performance between different groups of students. In the context of comprehensive schools, which aim to provide a generalized education to all students regardless of their background, the achievement gap often separates working-class students from their middle-class and upper-middle-class peers. This gap is rooted in various socio-economic factors that impact the educational experiences and outcomes of students from different backgrounds.

Several key factors contribute to this gap. Firstly, working-class students may have less access to resources outside of school, such as private tutoring, extracurricular activities, and educational materials, which can enhance their learning experiences. In contrast, their middle-class counterparts often have greater access to such resources due to higher family income levels, which can afford them advantages in both academic and personal development.

Additionally, working-class students frequently encounter challenges within the school environment itself. Comprehensive schools, while inclusive, often have to cater to a diverse range of student needs with limited resources. Working-class students might not receive the targeted support they require to bridge gaps in understanding that may arise from less support at home or from under-resourced primary schooling experiences.

Furthermore, parental involvement plays a significant role. Parents of middle-class students are generally more likely to be engaged in their children's education, either due to having more flexible work schedules or greater educational backgrounds themselves, enabling them to help with homework and advocate for their children’s needs within the school system.

Attitudinal factors and expectations also contribute to the achievement gap. Middle-class students often benefit from higher expectations set by both parents and teachers, which can encourage motivation and academic success. In contrast, working-class students might face lower expectations, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy where their potential is underestimated, and thus underdeveloped.

In conclusion, the achievement gap in comprehensive schools predominantly separates working-class students from their more affluent peers. This divide is fueled by economic disparities, differences in available resources, varying levels of parental involvement, and distinct expectations from educators. Addressing this gap requires comprehensive strategies that include improved resource allocation, community and parental engagement initiatives, and policies aiming to raise expectations and opportunities for all students.",450.0,1360.0,1871,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.72934627532959,1.3429608345031738,8.39026689529419,middle class peers,1.0
"Regardless of the ability of the Luftwaffe to win air superiority, Adolf Hitler was frustrated that it was not happening quickly enough. With no sign of the RAF weakening, and Luftwaffe air fleets (Luftflotten) taking punishing losses, the OKL was keen for a change in strategy. To reduce losses further, a change in strategy was also favoured to take place at night, to give the bombers greater protection under cover of darkness.[b] On 4 September 1940, in a long address at the Sportspalast, Hitler declared: ""And should the Royal Air Force drop two thousand, or three thousand [kilograms ...] then we will now drop [...] 300,000, 400,000, yes one million kilograms in a single night. And should they declare they will greatly increase their attacks on our cities, then we will erase their cities.""",What did the punishing losses to the air fleet cause the Luftwaffe to do?,change in strategy,2,DESC,"What did the punishing losses to the air fleet cause the Luftwaffe to do?

Relevant context: The punishing losses suffered by the Luftwaffe, particularly during critical campaigns such as the Battle of Britain and later in the Eastern Front, compelled the German Air Force to undergo significant strategic and tactical adjustments. Initially, the Luftwaffe had been a formidable force, playing a crucial role in the rapid advances of the Wehrmacht through Poland and Western Europe. However, as the war progressed, several factors began to detrimentally impact its effectiveness.

The Air Battle of Britain in 1940 exposed critical vulnerabilities in the Luftwaffe's operational strategies. Sustaining heavy losses of aircraft and experienced pilots, the Luftwaffe found itself on the back foot, as Britain’s Royal Air Force successfully resisted the German aerial onslaught. Consequently, one of the immediate responses of the Luftwaffe was to shift its tactics from daylight strategic bombing to nocturnal bombing campaigns, or the Blitz, which, although causing significant damage, did not achieve the intended objective of forcing Britain to capitulate.

As the war extended into the Eastern Front with Operation Barbarossa, the Luftwaffe was again burdened by extensive operational demands, stretching its resources thin. The harsh climatic conditions, coupled with fierce Soviet resistance, resulted in further attrition. In response, the Luftwaffe had to prioritize critical fronts and missions, often leading to a redistribution of squadrons and reallocation of resources to focus on maintaining air superiority in key areas or supporting ground troops through close air support missions.

In the face of mounting losses and the increasingly effective Allied bombing campaigns over Germany, the Luftwaffe was forced to re-evaluate its production and training strategies. The German high command initiated the Emergency Fighter Program in 1944, accelerating the development and production of aircraft like the Messerschmitt Me 262, the world's first operational jet fighter, in a bid to regain control of the airspace. However, these technological advancements were too few and came too late to turn the tide of the air war.

The Luftwaffe also experienced a chronic shortage of experienced pilots due to the high attrition rates. In an effort to mitigate this, the training period for new pilots was reduced, leading to a dilution in the quality of aircrew, which further affected the Luftwaffe's performance in combat.

Ultimately, the cumulative impact of these losses and the strategic decisions they spurred contributed to the gradual erosion of the Luftwaffe's combat effectiveness, which hindered its ability to defend the Reich's airspace against the relentless Allied air offensives. This strategic weakening of the Luftwaffe had profound implications for Nazi Germany's ability to sustain its war efforts on multiple fronts.",547.0,1707.0,2317,1.0,0.2,0.38685280723454163,8.306267261505127,1.3129582405090332,11.21050214767456,Change strategy,0.5
"To clean up pollution, the federal and local governments implemented numerous plans including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions, such as ozone and nitrogen oxides. When the levels of these two pollutants reached critical levels, contingency actions were implemented which included closing factories, changing school hours, and extending the A day without a car program to two days of the week. The government also instituted industrial technology improvements, a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuels. The introduction of Metrobús bus rapid transit and the Ecobici bike-sharing were among efforts to encourage alternate, greener forms of transportation.",How often do citizens need to get their cars examined?,biannual,2,DESC,"How often do citizens need to get their cars examined?

Relevant context: In most regions, the frequency with which citizens need to have their cars inspected or examined typically depends on a combination of factors, including local regulations, the age and type of vehicle, and its intended use. 

Generally, a standard requirement in many places is for vehicles to undergo an annual examination, often referred to as an inspection or a roadworthiness test. This routine inspection assesses the car's safety features, emissions levels, and overall mechanical condition to ensure it meets the legal standards for safe operation on public roads. For example, in the United States, the requirements vary by state: some states require annual inspections, while others have biennial inspections, and a few may not require inspections at all.

For newer vehicles, some jurisdictions offer a grace period, such as a reduced inspection frequency. For instance, a brand-new car might not need its first inspection until it is two or three years old. On the other hand, older vehicles might be subject to more stringent inspection requirements to ensure ongoing compliance with safety and environmental regulations.

Commercial vehicles often adhere to even stricter inspection schedules due to their extensive use and the higher risks associated with their operation. For these vehicles, semi-annual or even quarterly inspections might be mandated.

Additionally, inspections may be required when a vehicle changes ownership, moves into a different jurisdiction, or after specific modifications impacting the vehicle’s safety or emission characteristics. 

It is vital for vehicle owners to check with their local Department of Motor Vehicles or equivalent regulatory body to understand the specific requirements and schedules applicable in their area, as failing to comply with inspection mandates can result in fines, penalties, or the vehicle being deemed unfit for road use.",346.0,1609.0,2012,1.0,0.25,0.43067655807339306,4.640981912612915,1.7159459590911865,7.584890842437744,Biannually,0.5
"Travel and tourism continue to be extremely important for Portugal, with visitor numbers forecast to increase significantly in the future.[citation needed] However, the increasing competition from Eastern European destinations continues to develop, with the presence of similar attractions that are often cheaper in countries such as Croatia. Consequently, it has been necessary for the country to focus upon its niche attractions, such as health, nature and rural tourism, to stay ahead of its competitors.",How does Portugal compete with other areas for tourists?,focus upon its niche attractions,2,DESC,"How does Portugal compete with other areas for tourists?

Relevant context: Portugal competes with other tourist destinations by leveraging its unique blend of natural beauty, cultural richness, affordability, and strategic marketing. First and foremost, the country's diverse landscape, featuring stunning beaches along the Algarve coast, the lush vineyards of the Douro Valley, and the dramatic cliffs of Madeira, offers varied experiences to attract different types of tourists. This geographic diversity allows Portugal to cater to beachgoers, wine enthusiasts, adventure seekers, and nature lovers alike.

In addition to its natural attractions, Portugal capitalizes on its rich cultural heritage and historical significance. Cities like Lisbon and Porto boast picturesque neighborhoods, impressive architecture, and vibrant nightlife. UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as the Tower of Belém and the Monastery of Batalha, provide a window into Portugal's storied past. Festivals like Carnaval and the Festa de São João offer tourists a chance to immerse themselves in local traditions.

Portugal also emphasizes its culinary excellence, positioning itself as a foodie destination. Restaurants across the country showcase the best of Portuguese cuisine, including staples like bacalhau (salted cod), pastel de nata (custard tart), and a range of excellent wines. The popularity of culinary tourism has helped Portugal distinguish itself from other destinations.

Affordability is another key factor in Portugal's competitive edge. Compared to many Western European countries, Portugal offers great value for tourists. Reasonably priced accommodations, dining, and attractions make it an attractive option for budget-conscious travelers.

Portugal's tourism strategy is supported by strong marketing campaigns, often highlighting its major cities, diverse landscapes, and coastal regions in visually appealing advertisements.

"A person's self-report is the most reliable measure of pain, with health care professionals tending to underestimate severity. A definition of pain widely employed in nursing, emphasizing its subjective nature and the importance of believing patient reports, was introduced by Margo McCaffery in 1968: ""Pain is whatever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever he says it does"". To assess intensity, the patient may be asked to locate their pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain at all, and 10 the worst pain they have ever felt. Quality can be established by having the patient complete the McGill Pain Questionnaire indicating which words best describe their pain.",What are patients asked to use the McGill Pain Questionnaire to indicate?,which words best describe their pain,2,DESC,"What are patients asked to use the McGill Pain Questionnaire to indicate?

Relevant context: Patients are asked to use the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) to provide a comprehensive assessment of their pain experiences. This renowned tool is intended to capture the multidimensional nature of pain. The MPQ helps patients articulate the quality, intensity, and location of their pain through a series of descriptive words and scales.

To complete the MPQ, patients are guided through several components. Firstly, they use a body diagram to indicate the specific areas where they feel pain. This helps in pinpointing exact locations and understanding how pain may affect different body parts.

Secondly, the questionnaire presents a list of adjectives organized into groups, each describing various qualities of pain, such as sensory (e.g., throbbing, sharp, or burning) and affective (e.g., exhausting, fearful). Patients are asked to select the words that best describe their current pain experience. This section provides a qualitative measure of the pain's nature, allowing healthcare providers to gain insight into how the patient perceives their pain beyond mere intensity.

Furthermore, the MPQ includes a numeric scale or a visual analog scale where patients can indicate the severity of their pain. This quantitative measure helps in assessing the intensity of pain and tracking any changes over time, which can be critical in monitoring the effectiveness of pain management strategies.

By using the McGill Pain Questionnaire, healthcare professionals can obtain a rich, detailed understanding of a patient's pain. This information is crucial for developing tailored treatment plans, evaluating the impact of interventions, and advancing communication between patients and healthcare providers regarding the often complex and subjective experience of pain. Through its structured yet comprehensive approach, the MPQ serves as an essential tool in both clinical and research settings to assess and address chronic pain and related conditions.",360.0,1589.0,2009,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.084290981292725,1.6129505634307861,6.8492045402526855,Words describing pain,0.8
"Cultural barriers can also keep a person from telling someone they are in pain. Religious beliefs may prevent the individual from seeking help. They may feel certain pain treatment is against their religion. They may not report pain because they feel it is a sign that death is near. Many people fear the stigma of addiction and avoid pain treatment so as not to be prescribed potentially addicting drugs. Many Asians do not want to lose respect in society by admitting they are in pain and need help, believing the pain should be borne in silence, while other cultures feel they should report pain right away and get immediate relief. Gender can also be a factor in reporting pain. Sexual differences can be the result of social and cultural expectations, with women expected to be emotional and show pain and men stoic, keeping pain to themselves.",What is an issue of reporting pain specific to Asians?,do not want to lose respect in society by admitting they are in pain,2,DESC,"What is an issue of reporting pain specific to Asians?

Relevant context: One significant issue of reporting pain that is specific to Asians involves the cultural perceptions and communication styles regarding the expression of pain. In many Asian cultures, there is a strong emphasis on enduring discomfort silently and maintaining a composed demeanor even in the face of physical suffering. This cultural norm often leads to underreporting of pain among Asian patients. Factors such as filial piety, the importance of not burdening others, and a desire to avoid shame or embarrassment can contribute to this tendency. 

Furthermore, linguistic differences and the lack of equivalent terms between Asian languages and English to accurately convey the intensity or type of pain also play a role. In some Asian languages, the vocabulary for expressing specific pain sensations may be limited, which can make it challenging for patients to communicate their experience effectively when interacting with healthcare providers who may not be familiar with cultural contexts.

The issue is compounded by potential mistrust of Western medical systems, which can lead some Asian patients to prioritize traditional medicine or home remedies over seeking help in clinical settings. In the context of healthcare, this cultural silence around pain can have significant implications. It can result in the undertreatment of pain, inadequate pain management, and poorer health outcomes for Asian patients who might not vocalize their needs or concerns.

Healthcare providers may need to employ culturally sensitive communication strategies and build trust with Asian patients to encourage open dialogue about pain and make it easier for patients to discuss their symptoms. This could involve the use of interpreters familiar with the cultural nuances of pain expression, as well as the inclusion of family members in discussions to ensure that both patients and their families feel comfortable sharing concerns.

Understanding these cultural dimensions is crucial for improving pain assessment and management among Asian populations, ultimately leading to more equitable and effective healthcare outcomes.",360.0,1428.0,1845,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.2488057613372803,1.6669495105743408,6.154719829559326,Loss of respect,0.5
"The Alaska State Troopers are Alaska's statewide police force. They have a long and storied history, but were not an official organization until 1941. Before the force was officially organized, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies. Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on ""Public Safety Officers"" who have police training but do not carry firearms. In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available. In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations. Due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the Troopers' duties, they employ a wide variety of land, air, and water patrol vehicles.","What is different about a ""Public Safety Officer"" that distiguishes the position from a policeman?",have police training but do not carry firearms,2,DESC,"What is different about a ""Public Safety Officer"" that distiguishes the position from a policeman?

Relevant context: A Public Safety Officer (PSO) and a police officer both play crucial roles in maintaining safety and order within a community, but there are distinct differences between the two roles in terms of scope, responsibilities, and training.

Public Safety Officers often serve in a more generalized capacity compared to police officers. While a police officer's primary focus is on law enforcement, which includes investigating crimes, making arrests, and enforcing traffic laws, a Public Safety Officer typically has broader responsibilities that may encompass duties in areas such as emergency medical response, fire safety, and security services. This multidisciplinary approach allows PSOs to respond to a variety of situations that require different skill sets.

In terms of training, police officers undergo extensive law enforcement training, which includes learning tactics for apprehension, use of firearms, investigative procedures, and legal education on laws and procedures. In contrast, Public Safety Officers may receive cross-training that includes not only law enforcement practices but also basic fire response, first aid and emergency medical response, conflict resolution, and community service. This diverse training is designed to equip them with the tools necessary to handle a wide range of public safety incidents.

Another key distinction lies in jurisdiction and the authority to make arrests. Police officers are typically empowered by the state and local government to enforce laws and make arrests within their jurisdiction. On the other hand, Public Safety Officers may have limited or no arrest powers, depending on the regulations of the municipality or institution they serve. PSOs are often employed by schools, universities, hospitals, or private organizations, where they are tasked with ensuring the safety and security of the institution's property and people.

Additionally, the role of a Public Safety Officer may involve a greater emphasis on community engagement and preventive measures. They often work closely with community members, providing education on safety practices and participating in community-based safety programs. This aligns with their broader mission of enhancing overall safety rather than focusing solely on crime suppression.

In summary, while both Public Safety Officers and police officers are essential to maintaining community safety, their roles differ significantly in terms of scope and responsibilities. Public Safety Officers provide a more holistic safety service that blends law enforcement with other public safety functions, whereas police officers primarily focus on law enforcement duties. Understanding these differences helps clarify the unique contributions of each to community safety and well-being.",479.0,1391.0,1935,1.0,0.16666666666666666,0.3562071871080222,5.727177143096924,1.2395832538604736,8.08872365951538,No firearms,0.5
"In Miranda the court created safeguards against self-incriminating statements made after an arrest. The court held that ""The prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way, unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination""",What does the 5th Amendment protect against?,self-incrimination,2,DESC,"What does the 5th Amendment protect against?

Relevant context: The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides several important protections for individuals within the legal system. At its core, the Fifth Amendment offers a safeguard against abuse of government authority in legal procedures. One of its most well-known protections is the right against self-incrimination, often summarized by the phrase ""pleading the Fifth."" This means that individuals cannot be compelled to testify against themselves during a criminal case, which helps prevent forced confessions and ensures a fair trial process.

In addition to protection against self-incrimination, the Fifth Amendment also guarantees the right to due process. This means that the government must respect all legal rights that are owed to a person according to the law, ensuring fair procedures before depriving someone of life, liberty, or property. This principle applies to both federal and state governments through the doctrine of incorporation.

Another critical aspect of the Fifth Amendment is the protection against double jeopardy. This clause prevents an individual from being tried twice for the same offense. Once a person has been acquitted or convicted, they cannot be prosecuted again for the same crime, which protects individuals from repeated prosecutions that could be used as a form of harassment.

The Fifth Amendment also includes a clause on eminent domain, which requires the government to provide just compensation to property owners when it takes private property for public use. This ensures that individuals are fairly compensated for their property and that the government does not infringe upon property rights without adequate reason and recompense.

Overall, the Fifth Amendment plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of power between individuals and the government, safeguarding personal liberties, and ensuring justice is administered fairly. These protections form part of the broader Bill of Rights, reflecting the framers' intent to create a robust framework for civil liberties in the United States.",364.0,1427.0,1847,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.718734264373779,1.1259384155273438,6.892639636993408,Self-incrimination,1.0
"An example of this theory in action would be as follows: An emotion-evoking stimulus (snake) triggers a pattern of physiological response (increased heart rate, faster breathing, etc.), which is interpreted as a particular emotion (fear). This theory is supported by experiments in which by manipulating the bodily state induces a desired emotional state. Some people may believe that emotions give rise to emotion-specific actions: e.g. ""I'm crying because I'm sad,"" or ""I ran away because I was scared."" The issue with the James–Lange theory is that of causation (bodily states causing emotions and being a priori), not that of the bodily influences on emotional experience (which can be argued and is still quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and embodiment theory).",How is the stimulus interpreted by the mind?,as a particular emotion,2,DESC,"How is the stimulus interpreted by the mind?

Relevant context: The process by which a stimulus is interpreted by the mind is a complex interplay of sensory perception, neural processing, and cognitive understanding. When a stimulus is detected by the sensory organs—such as the eyes, ears, skin, nose, or tongue—the information is first converted into electrical signals. These signals are then transmitted through the nervous system to the brain for processing.

Upon reaching the brain, the initial stage of interpretation occurs in the primary sensory cortices. For instance, visual stimuli are processed in the occipital lobe, while auditory stimuli are handled in the temporal lobe. Here, the brain begins to organize and identify basic features of the stimulus, such as shape, color, pitch, or temperature.

Once the basic elements of the stimulus are identified, the information is further relayed to associative areas of the brain. These areas integrate the sensory details with existing knowledge and experience stored in long-term memory. This integration allows for more sophisticated interpretation, such as recognizing a face, understanding speech, or distinguishing complex scents.

Cognitive processes, such as attention and expectation, play a crucial role in how a stimulus is interpreted. The brain filters and prioritizes stimuli, focusing on the most relevant or significant ones while ignoring others. Context and personal experience heavily influence interpretation as well, as they shape the way the brain predicts and gives meaning to sensory information.

Emotion and past experiences further color perception. The limbic system, which is involved in emotional processing, can affect how a stimulus is perceived, making it pleasant, threatening, or neutral. For example, a pleasant aroma might signal a favorite food, triggering positive emotions and memories, while the same aroma under different circumstances might evoke dislike if associated with a negative event.

Ultimately, the interpretation of a stimulus by the mind is an active and dynamic process, shaped by the intricate network of neural pathways in conjunction with cognitive and emotional factors. This process allows humans to navigate and make sense of their complex environments, respond appropriately, and learn from their experiences.",411.0,1614.0,2080,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.587517023086548,1.1191229820251465,7.872609376907349,Symbolic reference,0.0
"During the Gilded Age, there was substantial growth in population in the United States and extravagant displays of wealth and excess of America's upper-class during the post-Civil War and post-Reconstruction era, in the late 19th century. The wealth polarization derived primarily from industrial and population expansion. The businessmen of the Second Industrial Revolution created industrial towns and cities in the Northeast with new factories, and contributed to the creation of an ethnically diverse industrial working class which produced the wealth owned by rising super-rich industrialists and financiers called the ""robber barons"". An example is the company of John D. Rockefeller, who was an important figure in shaping the new oil industry. Using highly effective tactics and aggressive practices, later widely criticized, Standard Oil absorbed or destroyed most of its competition.",What happened in the Glided Age/,extravagant displays of wealth and excess of America's upper-class,2,DESC,"What happened in the Glided Age/

Relevant context: The Gilded Age, spanning from the 1870s to around 1900, was a time of significant economic growth and transformation in the United States. This period was characterized by rapid industrialization, urbanization, and extensive immigration, which brought profound changes to American society.

One of the defining features of the Gilded Age was the dramatic expansion of the industrial economy. Major industries such as steel, railroads, coal, and oil saw unprecedented growth. Visionary industrialists like John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and J.P. Morgan emerged as powerful figures, amassing vast fortunes and exerting significant influence over the economy and politics.

The era was marked by the construction of a vast network of railroads, which facilitated the movement of goods and people across the country and fostered the growth of a national market. This transportation revolution was integral in the emergence of the United States as a major economic power.

However, the Gilded Age was also a time of stark social contrasts. While the wealthy elite lived in opulence—hence the name ""Gilded,"" which suggests a surface thinly covered with gold—many workers and immigrants faced difficult conditions. Factories were often characterized by long hours, low wages, and dangerous environments, leading to the rise of labor unions and strikes as workers organized for better conditions.

Urban areas grew rapidly as people flocked to cities in search of jobs, resulting in overcrowded living conditions and the emergence of tenement housing. This period of growth was fueled partly by a wave of immigration, with millions arriving from Europe and Asia, contributing to a rich cultural diversity but also to tensions and xenophobia.

Politically, the Gilded Age was an era of both corruption and reform. The political landscape saw patronage and the influence of business interests deeply entwined with government, famously illustrated by the Tammany Hall political machine in New York City. At the same time, this period laid the groundwork for the Progressive Era that followed, as calls for reform in response to Gilded Age excesses gained traction toward the turn of the century.

In summary, the Gilded Age was a transformative period marked by economic innovation and expansion, juxtaposed with significant social challenges and inequalities. It left a complex legacy that shaped the trajectory of the United States economically, socially, and politically.",482.0,1555.0,2091,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.19223928451538,1.0069735050201416,10.262100458145142,Wealth polarization,0.5
"Whitehead and Russell had thought originally that Principia Mathematica would take a year to complete; it ended up taking them ten years. To add insult to injury, when it came time for publication, the three-volume work was so massive (more than 2,000 pages) and its audience so narrow (professional mathematicians) that it was initially published at a loss of 600 pounds, 300 of which was paid by Cambridge University Press, 200 by the Royal Society of London, and 50 apiece by Whitehead and Russell themselves. Despite the initial loss, today there is likely no major academic library in the world which does not hold a copy of Principia Mathematica.",Why was there a funding shortfall for the publishing of Princpia Mathematica? ,"the three-volume work was so massive (more than 2,000 pages) and its audience so narrow (professional mathematicians)",2,DESC,"Why was there a funding shortfall for the publishing of Princpia Mathematica? 

Relevant context: The funding shortfall for the publication of ""Principia Mathematica""—an ambitious mathematical work authored by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell—stemmed from a combination of factors intrinsic to both the publishing industry and the scope of the project. Published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913, ""Principia Mathematica"" was an exhaustive and groundbreaking undertaking, aiming to establish logic as the foundation of all mathematics. 

One primary reason for the funding shortfall was the sheer length and complexity of the work. The comprehensiveness of the text necessitated extensive typesetting and proofreading, leading to higher production costs than typical publications of the era. Additionally, the specialized nature of the content meant that the anticipated audience was relatively small. While the work was of monumental importance within academic circles, it lacked widespread commercial appeal. As such, publishers were concerned about recouping their financial investment through sales alone.

Moreover, during this period, the economic climate was volatile, particularly with the looming outset of World War I, which would have influenced both publishers and potential investors' decisions. The economic uncertainty of the era added an additional layer of reluctance to invest in a project that required substantial upfront costs with the risk of limited financial return.

Furthermore, Whitehead and Russell's own resources were limited. While both were esteemed intellectuals, neither had the financial means to wholly underwrite the costs themselves. To cover the shortfall, they had to seek external funding from various academic institutions and benefactors interested in the advancement of mathematical logic. Remarkably, one of the sources that contributed was a grant from the Royal Society, albeit this was not enough to bridge the entire gap.

This funding shortfall did not prevent the ultimate publication of ""Principia Mathematica"", but it did underscore the challenges faced in distributing highly specialized academic works at the time. The situation exemplifies the broader difficulties faced by early 20th-century publishers in supporting pioneering theoretical work without viable commercial prospects.",415.0,1773.0,2251,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.582040548324585,5.27366828918457,21.036943197250366,Massive work,0.5
"Restrictions on media censorship were significantly eased in August 2012 following demonstrations by hundreds of protesters who wore shirts demanding that the government ""Stop Killing the Press."" The most significant change has come in the form that media organisations will no longer have to submit their content to a censorship board before publication. However, as explained by one editorial in the exiled press The Irrawaddy, this new ""freedom"" has caused some Burmese journalists to simply see the new law as an attempt to create an environment of self-censorship as journalists ""are required to follow 16 guidelines towards protecting the three national causes — non-disintegration of the Union, non-disintegration of national solidarity, perpetuation of sovereignty — and ""journalistic ethics"" to ensure their stories are accurate and do not jeopardise national security.""

Relevant context: As of October 2023, communications restrictions have undergone significant changes, primarily due to advancements in technology and shifts in regulatory frameworks. Over the past few years, various governments have revised their telecommunications policies to adapt to a rapidly digitalizing world and the challenges brought about by cyber threats and misinformation.

Firstly, the most notable change in communications restrictions is the increased regulation of internet content and social media platforms. Many countries have introduced stringent laws requiring platforms to remove harmful content, such as hate speech and misinformation, within specific timeframes. These laws often come with hefty penalties for non-compliance, leading platforms to invest heavily in content moderation technologies, such as AI and machine learning, to ensure adherence.

Additionally, there has been a push towards data localization, where communications data must be stored within the borders of the respective country. This change is aimed at enhancing security and privacy but also poses challenges for global companies operating in multiple jurisdictions, as they must now navigate complex data storage and transfer regulations.

In terms of digital communications, end-to-end encryption has been a focal point of contention. While it offers enhanced privacy for users, several governments argue that it hampers law enforcement efforts to combat terrorism and crime. Consequently, some countries have implemented laws requiring tech companies to provide access to encrypted communications under specific legal circumstances, sparking debates over privacy and state surveillance.

Furthermore, spectrum allocation has seen changes to accommodate the burgeoning demand for mobile data and the rollout of 5G networks. Many nations have auctioned off new bandwidths to telecom companies, often with provisions that stress equitable service distribution, particularly in underserved and rural areas.

Lastly, the pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote working technologies, prompting regulatory bodies to revisit and relax certain communications restrictions. These relaxations include temporary permissions for higher bandwidths and the easing of VoIP services restrictions in regions where they were previously banned or limited.

Overall, changes in communications restrictions reflect a delicate balancing act between fostering innovation and protecting national security and public order. Keeping abreast of these evolving regulations is crucial for individuals and entities operating within the digital communications landscape.",424.0,1532.0,2010,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.887964725494385,1.394956350326538,7.9168689250946045,Eased restrictions,0.7
"The Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) is a questionnaire designed to assess the psychosocial state of a person with chronic pain. Analysis of MPI results by Turk and Rudy (1988) found three classes of chronic pain patient: ""(a) dysfunctional, people who perceived the severity of their pain to be high, reported that pain interfered with much of their lives, reported a higher degree of psychological distress caused by pain, and reported low levels of activity; (b) interpersonally distressed, people with a common perception that significant others were not very supportive of their pain problems; and (c) adaptive copers, patients who reported high levels of social support, relatively low levels of pain and perceived interference, and relatively high levels of activity."" Combining the MPI characterization of the person with their IASP five-category pain profile is recommended for deriving the most useful case description.",What do dysfunctional people perceive the severity of their pain to be?,high,2,DESC,"What do dysfunctional people perceive the severity of their pain to be?

Relevant context: When discussing what dysfunctional individuals perceive the severity of their pain to be, it's essential to consider how their perceptions are shaped by both psychological and neurobiological factors. People who are described as ""dysfunctional"" often struggle with emotional regulation, distorted thinking patterns, and maladaptive behaviors, all of which can amplify their experience of pain.

Firstly, studies have shown that individuals with a dysfunctional approach to handling emotions may experience heightened pain perception. This is partly because they tend to ruminate on their discomfort, leading to increased stress and anxiety, which are known to exacerbate the experience of pain. The phenomenon where emotional and cognitive dysfunction amplifies pain is often observed in conditions like fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndromes, where comorbid psychological issues are prevalent.

Neurobiologically, dysfunctional individuals may experience altered pain processing pathways. The brain regions involved in pain perception, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and the prefrontal cortex, often show abnormal activation patterns in these individuals. This can result in a heightened sensory experience of pain stimuli, contributing to the perception that their pain is more severe than that of others who may be facing a similar condition without the same dysfunction.

Moreover, dysfunctional thinking patterns, such as catastrophizing, can further influence how these individuals perceive their pain. Catastrophizing involves magnifying the threat and consequences of the pain, leading someone to believe their pain is unbearable or unending, despite the actual stimulus intensity. This cognitive distortion can significantly alter their subjective experience, making the pain feel more severe.

Finally, social and environmental factors play a role. Dysfunctional individuals often have poor coping strategies and a lack of social support, which can lead to isolation and increased focus on their pain, thereby exacerbating its perceived severity. This perception is also reinforced by a possible history of trauma or adverse experiences that might affect this group's readiness to find appropriate coping mechanisms.

In summary, dysfunctional people often perceive the severity of their pain to be greater due to a combination of heightened emotional responses, distorted cognitive processes, abnormal neurobiological pain processing, and social factors. Understanding these underlying mechanisms can lead to more effective approaches to managing their pain, emphasizing both psychological and physical interventions.",453.0,1737.0,2247,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.069018602371216,1.3249597549438477,7.6483917236328125,High,1.0
"As part of the housing and credit booms, the number of financial agreements called mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO), which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices, greatly increased. Such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the U.S. housing market. As housing prices declined, major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime MBS reported significant losses.",What are MBS as related to the housing and credit booms?,mortgage-backed securities,2,DESC,"What are MBS as related to the housing and credit booms?

Relevant context: MBS, or Mortgage-Backed Securities, are financial instruments that played a pivotal role during the housing and credit booms of the early 2000s. They are created by bundling together a collection of home loans, which are then sold to investors. These securities are a type of asset-backed security and provide a means for banks to offload the risk of these loans, while also offering investors a steady stream of income from the interest and principal payments made by homeowners.

During the housing boom, the demand for MBS surged as they were seen as attractive investment vehicles due to their high credit ratings and perceived low risk. This demand encouraged lenders to issue more mortgages, including subprime loans to borrowers with poor credit histories, to create additional securities. The increased supply of credit made home financing more accessible, fueling rapid increases in home prices as more people were able to purchase homes or refinance existing mortgages.

However, the proliferation of MBS contributed to an unsustainable housing bubble. The originating lenders often did not maintain rigorous standards for granting loans, knowing they would quickly sell off these loans to be packaged into MBS. Rating agencies also rated many of these securities as low risk, despite the underlying loans potentially having high default risks. This misjudgment of risk contributed to the financial turmoil during the subsequent credit boom and eventual bust.

When home prices began to fall and foreclosure rates increased, the value of MBS plummeted. Many investors faced significant losses, and financial institutions that heavily invested in MBS or used them as collateral faced a crisis of liquidity and solvency. The ripple effects of these losses contributed to the broader financial crisis of 2007-2008, leading to a global economic downturn. In response, governments and central banks across the world implemented various measures, including the bailout of financial institutions and changes in regulatory oversight, to stabilize the financial system and prevent future crises of similar nature.",398.0,1460.0,1918,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.640078067779541,1.2049641609191895,8.156289100646973,Mortgage-backed securities,1.0
"As an initial response, Truman called for a naval blockade of North Korea, and was shocked to learn that such a blockade could be imposed only 'on paper', since the U.S. Navy no longer had the warships with which to carry out his request. In fact, because of the extensive defense cuts and the emphasis placed on building a nuclear bomber force, none of the services were in a position to make a robust response with conventional military strength. General Omar Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was faced with re-organizing and deploying an American military force that was a shadow of its World War II counterpart. The impact of the Truman administration's defense budget cutbacks were now keenly felt, as American troops fought a series of costly rearguard actions. Lacking sufficient anti-tank weapons, artillery or armor, they were driven back down the Korean peninsula to Pusan. In a postwar analysis of the unpreparedness of U.S. Army forces deployed to Korea during the summer and fall of 1950, Army Major General Floyd L. Parks stated that ""Many who never lived to tell the tale had to fight the full range of ground warfare from offensive to delaying action, unit by unit, man by man ...

Relevant context: The United States faced several challenges that affected its ability to provide an immediate and adequate response to the North Korean invasion of South Korea on June 25, 1950. A confluence of strategic, political, and military factors contributed to this situation.

Firstly, the outbreak of the Korean War caught the United States and its allies by surprise. After World War II, the US military had significantly demobilized its forces. By 1950, the American military presence in Asia had been greatly reduced, reflecting a broader trend of post-war downsizing. This diminishment left the United States with limited available troops and resources in the region to effectively counter a large-scale invasion.

Secondly, the geopolitical focus of the United States at the time was primarily on Europe, specifically the containment of Soviet expansion through Europe via mechanisms such as the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The defense of Western Europe against Soviet aggression was the top priority, and the belief that Europe would be the main battleground against communism meant that US military and diplomatic resources were concentrated there, leaving East Asia somewhat neglected.

In addition to strategic priorities, there were political and intelligence failures that hampered the US response. American intelligence agencies underestimated the likelihood of a North Korean invasion, believing that the Soviets had greater control over Kim Il-sung and that they would not permit such an aggressive move. This miscalculation delayed recognition of the threat and the urgency of the response required.

Furthermore, there was a lack of consensus within the US government and among its allies regarding the immediate steps needed to counter the invasion. Discussions in the United Nations, where the United States sought international support for a military response, took time. Although the UN quickly condemned the invasion and called for North Korean withdrawal, gathering and organizing a multinational force was not instantaneous.

On the ground in Korea, the initial US military response was hampered by inadequate preparation and outdated equipment. The American forces stationed in Japan, which were the first to be deployed to Korea, were ill-equipped for combat, sporting weapons and equipment that had not been adequately maintained since the end of World War II. These troops were not prepared for the scale and intensity of the conflict posed by the North Korean People's Army, which was better equipped and more determined initially.

In summary, the US's inability to provide a swift and adequate response to the Korean invasion was due to its strategic focus on Europe, intelligence miscalculations, limited military readiness and resources in Asia, and the slow rallying of international support. These factors combined to create a sluggish initial response to a rapidly evolving crisis.",538.0,2008.0,2609,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,5.302602052688599,5.628421306610107,12.230037689208984,Defense budget cutbacks,1.0

Relevant context: The US Libraries Initiative is a nationwide program designed to enhance the accessibility, resources, and technological infrastructure of public libraries across the United States. Launched by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) in collaboration with state-level library bodies and private foundations, this initiative aims to transform libraries into modern community hubs that serve the evolving educational and informational needs of the public.

The initiative has several key components. Firstly, it focuses on expanding digital and broadband access, particularly in underserved rural and urban areas where libraries often act as primary sources of internet access. By providing grants and technical support, the initiative helps libraries upgrade their technological capabilities and offers free or low-cost high-speed internet to patrons.

Another focal point of the US Libraries Initiative is educational programming. By partnering with local schools, community colleges, and workforce development agencies, libraries are encouraged to offer a wide variety of classes and workshops. These range from basic digital literacy courses and employment skills training to advanced coding bootcamps and professional certifications, aimed at closing the digital skills gap in the workforce.

Additionally, the initiative supports efforts to diversify library collections, making them more representative of America's diverse communities. This includes offering grants for expanding multilingual resources, as well as acquiring materials that reflect diverse cultural and historical perspectives. Libraries are also encouraged to host cultural events and authors' talks that promote inclusivity and community engagement.

To maintain and renovate library facilities, especially in areas where maintenance budgets have been historically underfunded, the initiative provides financial assistance for capital improvements. This includes comfortable seating, study spaces, and energy-efficient building upgrades, creating inviting environments for all age groups.

Relevant context: The decision was unique due to several unprecedented factors and the broader context in which it was made. Firstly, it marked the first time the company opted to pivot its core business model after decades of steadfast adherence to its traditional practices. For years, the company had relied heavily on manufacturing physical products, but the decision to transition to a primarily digital platform represented a significant shift. This strategic realignment was driven by the rapid digitalization of the industry, a trend the company had been cautiously observing but had not yet embraced fully.

Moreover, the implementation of this decision was unique because it involved a collaborative approach rarely seen in the company’s history. Traditionally, top-down directives had been the norm, with decisions being made by upper management alone. However, this time, the decision-making process was notably inclusive, involving input from various stakeholders, including employees at all levels, customers, and external consultants, who participated in a series of workshops and surveys. This collaborative effort ensured that the move was thoroughly vetted and supported by a diverse range of perspectives.

Another aspect contributing to the uniqueness of the decision was the timing. The decision was made in the wake of a global economic downturn, which had resulted in significant financial pressure. While other companies were scaling back their operations and investment in innovation, this company chose instead to double down on its commitment to future-proof its operations by investing in state-of-the-art technology and retraining its workforce for new digital roles.

Finally, the decision's rollout was carried out in a remarkably transparent manner. The company instituted regular updates to keep all stakeholders informed of the progress and challenges associated with the transition. This level of transparency was in stark contrast to the typical corporate communication strategies they had employed in previous years, which tended to be more guarded and selective.

"The evolution of the Greek economy during the 19th century (a period that transformed a large part of the world because of the Industrial Revolution) has been little researched. Recent research from 2006 examines the gradual development of industry and further development of shipping in a predominantly agricultural economy, calculating an average rate of per capita GDP growth between 1833 and 1911 that was only slightly lower than that of the other Western European nations. Industrial activity, (including heavy industry like shipbuilding) was evident, mainly in Ermoupolis and Piraeus. Nonetheless, Greece faced economic hardships and defaulted on its external loans in 1826, 1843, 1860 and 1894.","What did Greece do in 1826, 1843, 1860 and 1894?",defaulted on its external loans,2,DESC,"What did Greece do in 1826, 1843, 1860 and 1894?

Relevant context: In the year 1826, Greece was in the midst of its War of Independence against Ottoman rule, which had begun in 1821. This year was particularly significant as it involved a major battle known as the Siege of Missolonghi. The siege commenced in 1825, but it was in 1826 that it reached its tragic conclusion. After a prolonged and heroic defense against Ottoman forces, the city fell on April 10, 1826. The heroic ""Sortie of Missolonghi,"" where many defenders and civilians attempted to break the siege, is a poignant moment in Greek history, symbolizing sacrifice for independence.

Moving forward to 1843, Greece was engulfed in political turmoil, which catalyzed significant constitutional change. On September 3, 1843, a military uprising led by Colonel Dimitrios Kallergis in Athens forced King Otto to agree to grant a constitution. This event is known as the 3rd of September 1843 Revolution and led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in Greece. The Constitution of 1844 was a landmark in Greek governance, as it stipulated a bicameral parliament and ensured civil liberties, marking a critical step in the nation’s democratic evolution.

In 1860, Greece was experiencing a period of relative stability and state-building under King Otto, although political discontent was simmering beneath the surface. It was during the late 1850s and early 1860s that discussions around national identity and territory were intensifying, setting the stage for later conflicts and territorial expansions. Although 1860 itself was not marked by a single, pivotal event like other years, it was a time when Greece was consolidating its newly established institutions and dealing with the challenges of governance under Otto’s reign.

Finally, in 1894, Greece found itself amid preparations that would prelude a period of intensified confrontation and reform. This year marked significant political and social activity as Greece was looking towards modernizing its military and infrastructure. National sentiment was high, with aspirations for territorial expansion and the 'Great Idea' of uniting all Greeks, which foreshadowed the upcoming Greco-Turkish War of 1897. The end of the 19th century was a time of fervent nationalism and dynamic internal development, setting the stage for future events in Greece's quest for expansion and modernization.

In these years, each marked significant developments and challenges that helped shape the nation's path towards modern statehood, political reform, and national identity, reflecting Greece's enduring struggle and evolution in the 19th century.",543.0,1917.0,2528,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,6.009675025939941,1.2579593658447266,8.53981351852417,Defaulted on loans,0.8
"Neutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removal of the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of the overpopulation of dogs in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may have to later be euthanized.","In neutering, what is removed in female dogs?",ovaries and uterus,2,DESC,"In neutering, what is removed in female dogs?

Relevant context: Neutering, also referred to as spaying, is a surgical procedure performed on female dogs to make them sterile and incapable of reproduction. During this process, a veterinarian removes the female dog's reproductive organs, specifically the ovaries and uterus. This procedure is known medically as an ovariohysterectomy. 

In a typical spaying operation, the dog is placed under general anesthesia to ensure they are unconscious and do not feel pain during the surgery. The veterinarian makes a small incision in the abdomen, usually near the belly button, through which the ovaries and uterus are carefully accessed and removed. Removing these organs not only prevents pregnancy but also eliminates the animals' heat cycles and reduces the risk of certain health issues, such as mammary gland tumors and infections of the uterus known as pyometra.

After the surgery, the incision is closed with sutures, and the dog is monitored as she recovers from the anesthesia. Post-operative care is crucial, and dog owners are typically advised to limit their pet's physical activity and ensure she does not lick or chew at the incision site to prevent infection and other complications.

Spaying is a responsible choice for pet owners who do not intend to breed their dogs, offering health benefits and contributing to the control of the pet population. It is important for pet owners to discuss timing and any specific health concerns with their veterinarian to determine the best age and approach for spaying their dog.",299.0,1013.0,1371,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.117337942123413,3.526397228240967,7.920878648757935,Ovaries and uterus,1.0
"Informal learning usually takes place outside educational establishments, does not follow a specified curriculum and may originate accidentally, sporadically, in association with certain occasions, from changing practical requirements. It is not necessarily planned to be pedagogically conscious, systematic and according to subjects, but rather unconsciously incidental, holistically problem-related, and related to situation management and fitness for life. It is experienced directly in its ""natural"" function of everyday life and is often spontaneous.",What is not necessary for informal learning?,"to be pedagogically conscious, systematic and according to subjects",2,DESC,"What is not necessary for informal learning?

Relevant context: Informal learning is a natural way in which individuals acquire knowledge, skills, and understanding outside of a structured educational environment. It often occurs through daily activities related to work, family, community life, or leisure. One of the defining characteristics of informal learning is its flexibility and lack of formal constraints, which allows learners to pursue their interests at their own pace and according to their immediate needs. 

Consequently, several elements typically associated with formal education are not necessary for informal learning to occur:

1. **Standardized Curriculum**: Unlike formal education, informal learning does not require a standardized curriculum. Learners can explore topics of interest without following a predetermined set of courses or subjects. This gives individuals the freedom to focus on what they find relevant or engaging, often leading to more personalized and meaningful learning experiences.

2. **Certified Instructors or Teachers**: Informal learning does not necessitate the presence of certified instructors or teachers. Learning can happen through interactions with peers, mentors, or through self-directed exploration. Resources like books, videos, online forums, and community groups often provide adequate support for those seeking knowledge.

3. **Assessment and Grades**: There is no need for formal assessments, tests, or grades in informal learning. Success is often measured by the learner's ability to apply what they have learned to real-life situations or personal satisfaction. The lack of pressure from examinations allows learners to experiment and take risks without fear of failure.

4. **Institutional Settings**: Informal learning does not occur in traditional institutional settings such as schools or universities. It often takes place in diverse environments, including homes, workplaces, or through digital platforms. This allows learning to be more accessible and integrated into daily life.

5. **Rigid Timetables or Schedules**: Unlike formal education, informal learning does not adhere to rigid schedules or timetables. Learners can choose when and how long they engage in learning activities, allowing for flexibility that accommodates their personal and professional responsibilities.

In summary, informal learning thrives on its ability to adapt to the unique needs and contexts of learners, unhindered by the formal structures that characterize traditional education. This type of learning encourages exploration and creativity, fostering lifelong learning habits that are personalized and self-motivated.",460.0,1446.0,1959,1.0,1.0,1.0,10.206695556640625,1.2759637832641602,12.876610040664673,Curriculum,0.5
"In 2008, a BeiDou-1 ground terminal cost around CN¥20,000RMB (US$2,929), almost 10 times the price of a contemporary GPS terminal. The price of the terminals was explained as being due to the cost of imported microchips. At the China High-Tech Fair ELEXCON of November 2009 in Shenzhen, a BeiDou terminal priced at CN¥3,000RMB was presented.",Why is a BeiDou-1 ground terminal so expensive?,due to the cost of imported microchips,2,DESC,"Why is a BeiDou-1 ground terminal so expensive?

Relevant context: The high cost of a BeiDou-1 ground terminal can be attributed to several complex factors that revolve around its technological sophistication, manufacturing requirements, and proprietary nature. Initially deployed as part of China’s BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), BeiDou-1 was the first iteration of the system designed to provide regional navigation services. This early version consists of a constellation of satellites that communicate directly with ground terminals, necessitating advanced technology to interpret and utilize the satellite signals effectively.

One primary reason for the expense lies in the specialized hardware and software required. BeiDou-1 terminals must have highly sensitive receivers capable of locking onto the specific frequencies used by the BeiDou constellation. These receivers must be designed to minimize errors and optimize the positioning accuracy. The development and integration of these components demand significant research and development investment, which drives up the overall cost of production.

Moreover, the manufacturing process itself requires precision engineering. The terminals need to be robust enough to withstand diverse environmental conditions, ranging from urban interference to remote, rugged terrains where they might be deployed. High-quality materials and rigorous testing processes further contribute to the expense.

Another contributing factor is the limited scale of production. BeiDou-1, being the first generation with a relatively constrained regional focus, had a more niche market compared to subsequent global navigation systems. This reduced market size means that economies of scale are less achievable, which, in turn, keeps prices elevated due to smaller production batches and less spread of production costs.

Additionally, intellectual property and licensing fees also play a role. The BeiDou system technology is proprietary, and producing a compliant terminal requires adherence to numerous technical standards and protocols, often involving expensive licensing agreements.

Lastly, the need for secure communication capabilities and government compliance for certain applications can further drive up costs. Ground terminals used in sensitive areas such as military or governmental applications may require additional layers of encryption and security features, adding to the complexity and expense.

Ultimately, the cost of a BeiDou-1 ground terminal is a reflection of its advanced technological requirements, limited production volume, and the necessary adherence to proprietary and security standards. This combination ensures high reliability and accuracy but at a premium price point.",446.0,1220.0,1724,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.107870101928711,1.332524061203003,7.764263868331909,Imported microchips,0.7
"If current trends continue, missiles will replace gun systems completely in ""first line"" service.[citation needed] Guns are being increasingly pushed into specialist roles, such as the Dutch Goalkeeper CIWS, which uses the GAU-8 Avenger 30 mm seven-barrel Gatling gun for last ditch anti-missile and anti-aircraft defence. Even this formerly front-line weapon is currently being replaced by new missile systems, such as the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile, which is smaller, faster, and allows for mid-flight course correction (guidance) to ensure a hit. To bridge the gap between guns and missiles, Russia in particular produces the Kashtan CIWS, which uses both guns and missiles for final defence.

Relevant context: In recent years, the healthcare industry has seen a significant shift towards specialization, with a growing emphasis on training and deploying healthcare professionals into specialty roles. This trend is driven by several key factors that are transforming how care is delivered and how healthcare systems are organized.

Firstly, advancements in medical technology and research have led to a greater understanding of diseases and conditions, which in turn requires healthcare professionals to acquire more specialized knowledge and skills. For example, the rise in genomic medicine and personalized treatments necessitates experts who are trained in these specific areas, leading to an increase in the demand for specialized oncologists, genetic counselors, and pharmacists.

Secondly, the aging population and the prevalence of chronic diseases have created a need for professionals who can provide targeted care. Diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions require specialized intervention and management, leading to the formation of specialty roles in geriatrics, endocrinology, and cardiology. This shift ensures that patients receive more precise and nuanced care tailored to their specific health conditions.

Thirdly, healthcare systems are increasingly focusing on improving patient outcomes and efficiency. By directing professionals into specialty roles, healthcare providers can optimize care pathways and improve diagnostic accuracy. For instance, a specialist in orthopedic surgery can provide higher precision in joint replacement procedures, thereby reducing recovery times and improving long-term outcomes for patients.

Furthermore, regulatory and accreditation bodies have introduced standards that often require specific qualifications to practice in certain areas, propelling the trend towards specialization. Programs in medical education are also adapting to these changes by offering more fellowship opportunities and specialized training modules to equip new doctors with the necessary expertise to fill these roles.

Overall, the movement towards specialty roles in healthcare exemplifies a broader commitment to enhancing the quality of patient care, addressing specific health challenges, and meeting the demands of modern medical practice. This ongoing shift not only reflects the evolving landscape of medical knowledge and technology but also underscores the need for healthcare systems to adapt and prepare for future challenges.",398.0,1459.0,1915,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.182518005371094,1.363680124282837,11.88175344467163,additional skill identifier (ASI) training,0.0
"The conversion rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines the production of the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2. Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA). Moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin (up-regulation) and glucagon (down-regulation). The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of amino acid, can influence processes involving insulin, glucagon, and other hormones; therefore, the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health, and specific effects on immune function and inflammation, and mitosis (i.e., cell division).",What is an example of a hormone other than insulin that is able to control the enzyme delta-5-desaturase?,glucagon,2,DESC,"What is an example of a hormone other than insulin that is able to control the enzyme delta-5-desaturase?

Relevant context: In the realm of hormonal regulation and enzyme control, a notable example of a hormone other than insulin that influences delta-5-desaturase is cortisol. Cortisol, a steroid hormone produced in the adrenal cortex, plays a crucial role in various metabolic processes and stress responses. Recent studies have indicated that cortisol can modulate the activity of delta-5-desaturase, an enzyme essential in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism.

Delta-5-desaturase is responsible for converting dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) into arachidonic acid (AA), a key precursor in the biosynthesis of important signaling molecules called eicosanoids. These eicosanoids, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, are critical in inflammatory response, vascular function, and other physiological processes.

Cortisol's impact on delta-5-desaturase can be linked to its broader role in energy homeostasis and metabolism. Under conditions of chronic stress or prolonged elevated cortisol levels, adjustments in enzyme activities, including downregulation or upregulation of enzymes like delta-5-desaturase, can occur. This modulation may aid the body in adapting to stress by altering the production of various lipid signaling molecules associated with inflammation and immune response.

Research has demonstrated that cortisol may affect gene transcription related to delta-5-desaturase by interacting with glucocorticoid response elements in the gene promoter region. This interaction can lead to changes in the expression levels of delta-5-desaturase, thus influencing its enzymatic activity. Consequently, cortisol's role is not just limited to metabolic pathways involving glucose regulation, but extends to lipid metabolism, where it fine-tunes the production of bioactive lipids through enzymes like delta-5-desaturase.

In summary, cortisol represents a significant hormone, beyond just insulin, that can regulate the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, thereby impacting lipid metabolism and the production of critical signaling molecules. Understanding this relationship enhances our comprehension of metabolic adaptations under stress and sheds light on potential therapeutic approaches for metabolic disorders and inflammatory conditions.",447.0,1769.0,2286,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.236101150512695,1.327120304107666,9.056945562362671,Glucagon,1.0
"The financial crisis was not widely predicted by mainstream economists except Raghuram Rajan, who instead spoke of the Great Moderation. A number of heterodox economists predicted the crisis, with varying arguments. Dirk Bezemer in his research credits (with supporting argument and estimates of timing) 12 economists with predicting the crisis: Dean Baker (US), Wynne Godley (UK), Fred Harrison (UK), Michael Hudson (US), Eric Janszen (US), Steve Keen (Australia), Jakob Brøchner Madsen & Jens Kjaer Sørensen (Denmark), Kurt Richebächer (US), Nouriel Roubini (US), Peter Schiff (US), and Robert Shiller (US). Examples of other experts who gave indications of a financial crisis have also been given. Not surprisingly, the Austrian economic school regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable credit-fueled bubble that could not forestall the disregarded but inevitable effect of an artificial, manufactured laxity in monetary supply, a perspective that even former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan in Congressional testimony confessed himself forced to return to.",How did the Austrian economic school regard the crisis?,as a vindication,2,DESC,"How did the Austrian economic school regard the crisis?

Relevant context: The Austrian economic school, known for its emphasis on individual actions and market-driven processes, offers a distinctive perspective on economic crises. Proponents of this school, such as Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek, argue that economic crises often stem from prior government interventions in the economy, particularly in the form of artificially low interest rates and excessive monetary expansion.

According to Austrian economists, such interventions distort the natural interest rate—a crucial signal for coordination between savings and investments. When central banks lower interest rates below their natural level, this sends false signals to entrepreneurs and investors, leading to an unsustainable boom characterized by malinvestments—wrong investments in the production structure. In sectors such as housing, for example, low interest rates can spur significant over-investment, supported by cheap credit.

Once the central banks eventually tighten monetary policy, or when market forces try to correct these imbalances, these malinvestments are revealed, causing a bust or crisis. The correction process, necessary to realign consumption with real savings, can be severe, as misallocated resources need to be reallocated, businesses may fail, and unemployment may rise.

Austrian economists argue against short-term fiscal and monetary policies intended to kickstart the economy after the bust. They believe such measures only postpone the necessary correction process and worsen the long-term economic health by perpetuating earlier mistakes. Instead, they advocate for allowing the market to adjust naturally without interference, which they believe would restore sustainable growth.

Historically, Austrian economists have pointed to crises such as the Great Depression and the 2008 financial crisis to illustrate how prior credit expansions and governmental missteps set the stage for severe economic downturns. They emphasize the importance of sound money, fiscal responsibility, and reducing government intervention to prevent future crises.

Overall, the Austrian economic school views economic crises not as inherent failures of capitalism, but as the consequences of distorting market mechanisms through interventionist policy.",394.0,1670.0,2119,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.401350498199463,1.3392424583435059,7.020319938659668,Vindication,0.5
"DST has mixed effects on health. In societies with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise. It alters sunlight exposure; whether this is beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer. DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier, but some argue the reverse. The Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund, successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for US DST extensions.",What do societies with standardized work schedules have more time for because of the increase in afternoon daylight from DST?,outdoor exercise,2,DESC,"What do societies with standardized work schedules have more time for because of the increase in afternoon daylight from DST?

Relevant context: Daylight Saving Time (DST) plays a significant role in shaping the daily routines and dynamics of societies with standardized work schedules. By shifting the clock forward, typically by one hour in spring, DST extends the amount of usable daylight in the late afternoon and early evening. This change facilitates numerous benefits, allowing for a variety of activities and societal engagements that might otherwise be curtailed by diminishing daylight.

One prominent advantage is the increased opportunity for outdoor recreational activities. With more daylight post-work hours, individuals can engage in leisure pursuits such as jogging, cycling, hiking, or simply walking in local parks. This increase in daylight aligns well with the natural cessation of traditional work hours, providing a refreshing environment for exercise and physical activity, which are vital for maintaining overall health and well-being.

Furthermore, the retail and hospitality sectors often experience a positive impact from additional daylight, as people are more likely to venture out for shopping or dining. The pleasant evening light tends to encourage social interactions, prompting more visits to cafes, restaurants, and shops. In turn, businesses experience higher foot traffic and potentially increased sales, which can boost local economies.

Community activities also see a rise in participation due to longer daylight hours. After work, individuals can attend cultural events, community meetings, or sporting events, which are typically scheduled during this extended daylight period. This schedule flexibility can strengthen community ties and social connections, fostering a greater sense of belonging and engagement within the community.

Moreover, the extended daylight often correlates with a heightened sense of safety and security. With more light in the early evening, individuals might feel more comfortable and safe engaging in outside activities or commuting, reducing the propensity for incidents that might occur during darker hours.

Overall, societies with standardized work schedules benefit from Daylight Saving Time through enriched recreational opportunities, boosted economic activity in retail and hospitality, increased attendance in community events, and an enhanced sense of security and well-being. The extra afternoon daylight thus plays a crucial role in shaping lifestyle choices and enhancing the quality of life, underpinning the continued use and importance of DST in many parts of the world.",439.0,1214.0,1720,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.986731767654419,19.106505632400513,24.48716974258423,Leisure activities,0.5
"Industrialized societies generally follow a clock-based schedule for daily activities that do not change throughout the course of the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, the effect becoming greater as one moves away from the tropics.",What is the tilt of the Earth that causes solar time to change called?,axial tilt,2,DESC,"What is the tilt of the Earth that causes solar time to change called?

Relevant context: The tilt of the Earth that causes changes in solar time is referred to as the ""axial tilt"" or ""obliquity"" of the Earth. This tilt is approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun. As the Earth revolves around the sun annually, this axial tilt is responsible for the varying angle of sunlight received at different locations, leading to the changing lengths of days and solar time throughout the year. The axial tilt is a significant factor in creating the seasons, as it affects the directness and duration of sunlight reaching Earth's surface at different times of the year.

In terms of solar time, axial tilt is what causes phenomena such as the equation of time, which is the discrepancy between solar time and clock time throughout the year. This discrepancy fluctuates because the Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle but an ellipse, and as the Earth tilts and moves in its elliptical path, the apparent speed of the sun across the sky varies. This variation leads to solar noon, the time when the sun is highest in the sky, not always occurring at the same time on a clock each day. 

Understanding Earth's axial tilt is crucial for comprehending why sundials, which rely on solar time, do not always match up with mechanical clocks, and why corrective measures, like the equation of time, are necessary for accurate timekeeping throughout the year.",293.0,1082.0,1436,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.290484666824341,1.2384402751922607,5.85404634475708,Axial tilt,1.0
"The USAF is the only branch of the U.S. military where NCO status is achieved when an enlisted person reaches the pay grade of E-5. In all other branches, NCO status is generally achieved at the pay grade of E-4 (e.g., a Corporal in the Army and Marine Corps, Petty Officer Third Class in the Navy and Coast Guard). The Air Force mirrored the Army from 1976 to 1991 with an E-4 being either a Senior Airman wearing three stripes without a star or a Sergeant (referred to as ""Buck Sergeant""), which was noted by the presence of the central star and considered an NCO. Despite not being an NCO, a Senior Airman who has completed Airman Leadership School can be a supervisor according to the AFI 36-2618.",What must a Senior Airman do to become a supervisor in the USAF?,completed Airman Leadership School,2,DESC,"What must a Senior Airman do to become a supervisor in the USAF?

Relevant context: To become a supervisor in the United States Air Force (USAF) as a Senior Airman, one must meet several criteria and follow a defined career development path. The journey from Senior Airman to a supervisory role involves a combination of time-in-service requirements, completing professional military education, obtaining necessary training, and demonstrating leadership potential.

Firstly, _time-in-grade_ and _time-in-service_ are essential factors. A Senior Airman must have typically served a minimum of three years in the Air Force and at least six months in the rank of Senior Airman to be eligible for promotion to Staff Sergeant, which is the rank where supervisory responsibilities begin. 

In addition to meeting time-in-grade requirements, completing professional military education (PME) is critical. Senior Airmen aiming to become supervisors must complete the Airman Leadership School (ALS). This course, which is about 24 days long for on-site classes, is designed to equip Airmen with the leadership skills required to handle supervisory duties effectively. ALS covers topics such as effective communication skills, understanding the roles and responsibilities of NCOs, and learning how to manage teams.

Another essential aspect is receiving favorable recommendations from their chain of command. This typically involves demonstrating key attributes such as reliability, accountability, and a strong work ethic. Senior Airmen are often expected to take on leadership roles within their current capacity to show their ability to manage additional responsibilities. This could include leading small teams, mentoring junior Airmen, or managing projects or daily operations within their unit.

Furthermore, meeting physical fitness standards and behaving in a manner that reflects the core values of the Air Force—integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do—are considered imperative for those aspiring to become supervisors.

Once a Senior Airman has met these prerequisites, they must then complete the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) testing for promotion to Staff Sergeant. This testing combines scores from performance evaluations, time-in-service/grade, decorations, and specialty knowledge, ensuring that the most qualified individuals advance.

Therefore, by fulfilling the time-in-grade requirement, completing Airman Leadership School, obtaining recommendations from superior officers, satisfying fitness and core value standards, and successfully passing the promotion exam, a Senior Airman can progress to a supervisory role and take the next step in their Air Force career.",484.0,1674.0,2222,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.8623669147491455,1.22316312789917,6.286748170852661,Complete Airman Leadership School,0.8
"Though mechanization transformed most aspects of human industry by the mid-20th century, garment workers have continued to labor under challenging conditions that demand repetitive manual labor. Mass-produced clothing is often made in what are considered by some to be sweatshops, typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in developing countries, clothes made in industrialized nations may also be manufactured similarly, often staffed by undocumented immigrants.[citation needed]",What is a feature of sweatshops beyond lack of benefits and representation?,long work hours,2,DESC,"What is a feature of sweatshops beyond lack of benefits and representation?

Relevant context: Sweatshops are notorious not only for their lack of benefits and inadequate worker representation but also for their deplorable working conditions. One of the most striking features of sweatshops is the unsafe and unhealthy environment in which employees are often required to work. These conditions can include overcrowded spaces, lack of proper ventilation, insufficient lighting, and inadequate sanitation facilities. Many sweatshops operate in facilities that are not up to safety codes, which can lead to serious accidents and health hazards for workers.

In some instances, workers are exposed to dangerous chemicals without the proper protective equipment or training on how to handle these substances safely. This exposure can lead to long-term health problems, such as respiratory issues, skin conditions, and even chronic illnesses. Furthermore, the machinery used in sweatshops is often outdated and poorly maintained, increasing the risk of workplace injuries. Workers might have to operate these machines for long hours without breaks, which can lead to fatigue-related accidents.

Additionally, extreme temperature conditions can make these environments even more unbearable. Inadequate climate control can lead to sweltering heat in the summer and bone-chilling cold in the winter, further exacerbating the discomfort and health risks workers face.

These unsafe working conditions are a significant aspect of sweatshops, compounding the exploitation of laborers who already endure low wages and excessive working hours. The combination of these factors makes it challenging for workers to advocate for their rights and improves their working conditions, as they are often financially vulnerable and fear losing their only source of income.",316.0,1314.0,1690,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.3552920818328857,1.8956882953643799,6.396972894668579,Long work hours,1.0
"On the recovery side of the flight deck, the adaptation to the aircraft loadout is mirrored. Non-VTOL or conventional aircraft cannot decelerate on their own, and almost all carriers using them must have arrested-recovery systems (-BAR, e.g. CATOBAR or STOBAR) to recover their aircraft. Aircraft that are landing extend a tailhook that catches on arrestor wires stretched across the deck to bring themselves to a stop in a short distance. Post-WWII Royal Navy research on safer CATOBAR recovery eventually led to universal adoption of a landing area angled off axis to allow aircraft who missed the arresting wires to ""bolt"" and safely return to flight for another landing attempt rather than crashing into aircraft on the forward deck.",What is the purpose of an arrested-recovery system?,to recover their aircraft,2,DESC,"What is the purpose of an arrested-recovery system?

Relevant context: An arrested-recovery system is designed to halt the progression of an undesirable condition or process and to facilitate its subsequent recovery to a desired state. Such systems are often implemented in various industries, including aviation, biochemical processes, and information technology, to ensure safety, efficiency, and reliability.

In aviation, for instance, the purpose of an arrested-recovery system, such as an arresting gear, is to provide a mechanism by which an aircraft can quickly decelerate and come to a stop. This is particularly crucial on aircraft carriers, where runway space is limited. The system typically involves a series of cables and hydraulic or mechanical systems that can safely absorb the kinetic energy of the landing aircraft, thus preventing it from overrunning the deck.

In biochemical processes, an arrested-recovery system might be employed in fermentation or cell culture methodologies to delay the onset of inhibitory conditions or toxic by-products that could otherwise halt growth or productivity. By managing the environmental conditions, such as pH, temperature, or nutrient supply, the system allows for controlled recovery and continuation of the process, optimizing yield and operational stability.

In information technology, an arrested-recovery system can take the form of software solutions aimed at detecting and halting the spread of malware or data corruption within a network. Once identified, such systems provide tools for recovery, either through system restoration to a previous state, isolation of affected areas, or through secondary systems that maintain data integrity and continuity of operations.

Overall, the core purpose of an arrested-recovery system is to prevent a full-scale failure and to provide a structured pathway back to normalcy.

Relevant context: If diarrhea is stopped, particularly through the use of medication, several physiological changes and considerations can follow. Stopping diarrhea can bring immediate relief from symptoms such as frequent, loose stools, abdominal cramping, and the urgent need to use the bathroom. This relief can significantly improve a person's quality of life, allowing them to continue with daily activities without disruption.

However, it is essential to consider the underlying cause of diarrhea before attempting to stop it with medication. Diarrhea often serves as a defense mechanism by the body to expel harmful pathogens, byproducts, or toxins from the gastrointestinal tract. In cases where diarrhea is caused by an infection, halting it too quickly could potentially allow these pathogens to remain in the gut, possibly extending the illness or worsening the infection. Therefore, it is generally advised to only use anti-diarrheal treatments under guidance from a healthcare professional, particularly when dealing with infections such as bacterial gastritis or traveler's diarrhea.

Beyond symptomatic relief, stopping diarrhea can help prevent dehydration, which is a common complication due to excessive fluid loss. Diarrhea can lead to significant loss of fluids and electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, which are crucial for normal cellular function. This is why rehydration, with oral rehydration solutions, is often recommended to accompany any treatment to stop diarrhea.

In chronic or severe cases, addressing diarrhea helps in diagnosing and managing underlying health conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or food intolerances. Resolving diarrhea can provide valuable insight into the condition's triggers and aid in long-term management strategies.

In conclusion, while stopping diarrhea can be beneficial for comfort and preventing dehydration, it should be done with careful consideration of the cause. Treatment should aim to balance symptom management with addressing the underlying condition to ensure a holistic approach to health.",379.0,1367.0,1801,1.0,0.14285714285714285,0.3333333333333333,3.8769538402557373,1.9979057312011719,7.034598350524902,Delay in recovery,0.9
"In 2005, the number of public employees per thousand inhabitants in the Portuguese government (70.8) was above the European Union average (62.4 per thousand inhabitants). By EU and USA standards, Portugal's justice system was internationally known as being slow and inefficient, and by 2011 it was the second slowest in Western Europe (after Italy); conversely, Portugal has one of the highest rates of judges and prosecutors—over 30 per 100,000 people. The entire Portuguese public service has been known for its mismanagement, useless redundancies, waste, excess of bureaucracy and a general lack of productivity in certain sectors, particularly in justice.","In comparison to EU and USA standards, how was Portugal's justice system regarded?",slow and inefficient,2,DESC,"In comparison to EU and USA standards, how was Portugal's justice system regarded?

Relevant context: In a comparative analysis of justice systems across the European Union and the United States, Portugal's justice system has been the subject of both praise and criticism, often noted for its unique approach and history. Generally, Portugal has been recognized for its progressive stance on certain issues, particularly its decriminalization of drugs in 2001, which marked a significant departure from traditional punitive models and garnered international attention. This policy shift focused on treating drug addiction as a health issue rather than a criminal one, leading to positive outcomes in reducing drug-related deaths and HIV infection rates, and has been lauded as a successful example for other nations to consider.

However, when evaluated against broader judicial standards, some challenges within Portugal's system have been highlighted. The efficiency of the Portuguese judiciary has been under scrutiny, with concerns about the speed of judicial proceedings and the backlog of cases. This has led to perceptions of inefficiency, particularly in comparison to some of its EU counterparts and the relatively swifter process typically found in the U.S. legal system. Reports have frequently cited the need for modernization in court management and case tracking systems to address these delays, a common theme echoed in multiple assessments by EU justice scoreboards.

Moreover, access to legal services and representation in Portugal has also been critiqued. While Portugal boasts a comprehensive public defense system, disparities in quality between public defenders and private attorneys can be more pronounced compared to countries with a more robustly funded public legal aid framework, such as those in the Nordic region. 

On the human rights front, Portugal generally aligns well with EU standards, maintaining a strong commitment to upholding the European Convention on Human Rights. However, instances of prison overcrowding and the conditions of incarceration have attracted criticism, similar to issues faced across many EU member states, highlighting a need for reform that has been more systematically addressed in jurisdictions like the Netherlands and Germany.

In summary, while Portugal's justice system is viewed as innovative in certain policy areas and committed to upholding human rights, it faces ongoing challenges related to procedural efficiency and resource allocation that impact the perception of its overall effectiveness when compared to both EU and U.S. standards. The general consensus recognizes Portugal's advances in drug policy and human rights, but also urges enhancements in judicial efficiency and access to further harmonize with leading international justice systems.",478.0,1463.0,2003,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,5.648961782455444,1.0048062801361084,8.665995836257935,Slow and inefficient,1.0
"Once the elevator arrives at the floor, it will park with its doors open and the car buttons will be disabled to prevent a passenger from taking control of the elevator. Medical personnel must then activate the code-blue key switch inside the car, select their floor and close the doors with the door close button. The elevator will then travel non-stop to the selected floor, and will remain in code-blue service until switched off in the car.

Relevant context: Upon arriving at the designated floor, the elevator undergoes a series of precise and coordinated actions to ensure the safe and efficient transfer of passengers. First, the elevator decelerates smoothly as it approaches the desired level, minimizing any abrupt movements that might discomfort the passengers inside. This deceleration is carefully controlled by the elevator’s motor and regulatory system to ensure both accuracy and comfort.

As the elevator cab aligns perfectly with the floor level, it comes to a complete stop. At this point, the system checks to ensure that it is properly aligned with the floor’s entrance. This check is crucial for safety and prevents any tripping hazards. Once the alignment is confirmed, the elevator doors proceed to open automatically. This typically involves two sets of doors – the cab doors and the landing doors on the floor – which are synchronized to slide open simultaneously. 

The doors open at a moderate speed to allow passengers to exit and enter safely. During this process, sensors embedded within the elevator doors detect obstructions. If an object or a person is detected in the doorway, the doors will reopen to allow clearance before attempting to close again. 

Once the exchange of passengers is completed and the doorways are clear of any obstructions, the elevator doors will close automatically. After the doors are securely closed, the elevator is ready to proceed to another floor as instructed by new passenger inputs or pre-programmed commands from a central system.

Myanmar was bombed extensively by both sides. After independence, the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed. After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister U Nu embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was declared the owner of all land. The government also tried to implement a poorly considered Eight-Year plan.

Plans were partly financed by printing money, which led to inflation.",How was the Burma framework affected by WWII ?,the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed.,2,DESC,"How was the Burma framework affected by WWII ?

Relevant context: World War II had a profound impact on the political, social, and economic framework of Burma, reshaping the region and setting the stage for significant changes in the following decades.

Politically, the invasion of Burma by Japanese forces in 1942 dramatically altered the colonial dynamics established by the British since the 19th century. The British colonial administration was forced to evacuate, leaving a power vacuum that the Japanese attempted to fill by promoting Burmese nationalism to garner local support. They established the Burma Independence Army (BIA), consisting largely of Burmese nationalists including Aung San, a prominent figure who later became instrumental in Burma's post-war independence movement. Though the Japanese promised independence, they maintained significant control, which eventually led to disillusionment among Burmese leaders.

Socially, the war brought significant upheaval. The Japanese occupation and fighting displaced populations, leading to a humanitarian crisis marked by shortages of food and medical supplies. Additionally, ethnic tensions were exacerbated, as the Japanese occupation forces manipulated relationships with various ethnic groups, most notably between the majority Burmans and the minority Karen and Shan communities, sowing seeds of future ethnic conflicts.

Economically, the war devastated the Burmese infrastructure. Japan's scorched earth tactics and the allied bombing campaigns left the economy in ruins and disrupted the colonial export farming system that had previously defined much of the Burmese economy. Post-war, Burma faced considerable challenges in rebuilding its infrastructure and economy, which affected its path to independence and development.

The end of WWII brought a swift return of British colonial forces who attempted to reestablish control over the territory, but the sentiment for self-rule had gained irreversible momentum during the war years. This led to the Panglong Agreement in 1947, facilitated by General Aung San, which sought to unify different ethnic groups under an independent Burmese government. Burma eventually gained independence from Britain in 1948, influenced significantly by the power shifts and ideologies cultivated during the war.

In summary, WWII transformed Burma from a British colony into a nation on the brink of independence, while leaving lasting impacts on its social fabric and economic structures, creating a complex legacy that would influence the country's future trajectory.",443.0,1809.0,2307,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,4.727018594741821,1.416682481765747,7.120178699493408,Devastated,0.5
"In 2007, the USAF undertook a Reduction-in-Force (RIF). Because of budget constraints, the USAF planned to reduce the service's size from 360,000 active duty personnel to 316,000. The size of the active duty force in 2007 was roughly 64% of that of what the USAF was at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991. However, the reduction was ended at approximately 330,000 personnel in 2008 in order to meet the demand signal of combatant commanders and associated mission requirements. These same constraints have seen a sharp reduction in flight hours for crew training since 2005 and the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower and Personnel directing Airmen's Time Assessments.",Why did the USAF plan to take a reduction-in-force?,budget constraints,2,DESC,"Why did the USAF plan to take a reduction-in-force?

Relevant context: In recent years, the United States Air Force (USAF) announced plans for a reduction-in-force (RIF), driven by a combination of budgetary pressures, technological advancements, and strategic realignments. This strategic decision was rooted in several key factors, reflecting broader shifts within the military and defense sectors.

Firstly, budgetary constraints significantly influenced the USAF's decision. The Department of Defense faced tightening budgets as a result of national fiscal policies aimed at reducing the federal deficit. With defense spending under scrutiny, the USAF needed to prioritize funding for critical modernization programs, such as the development of advanced aircraft like the B-21 Raider and the ongoing F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Redirecting resources away from personnel costs, which constitute a substantial portion of the military budget, allowed for continued investment in these crucial technological advancements.

Secondly, the changing nature of warfare and the need for technological superiority necessitated a shift in focus. As global military challenges evolved, the USAF recognized the importance of embracing new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cyber warfare capabilities, and unmanned systems. These advancements required a different skill set, which the current force structure was not optimally designed to support. By reducing manpower, the USAF aimed to reallocate roles and resources towards building a workforce capable of operating and maintaining these emerging technologies.

Additionally, strategic defense priorities played a role in the decision. The USAF sought to streamline its operations to align with the National Defense Strategy, which emphasized preparedness for near-peer competition, particularly with nations like China and Russia. This shift called for an agile and technologically advanced force, capable of rapid deployment and adaptive response, rather than a larger, less technologically equipped force.

Finally, the RIF was part of a broader initiative to enhance efficiency and effectiveness within the armed forces. By reducing redundancies and eliminating positions that were deemed less critical to the current mission, the USAF planned to enhance its operational capabilities and readiness. This move was consistent with efforts across the military to reform and optimize force structures in response to dynamic global threats.

In summary, the USAF's reduction-in-force was a multifaceted decision driven by budgetary limitations, the need to prioritize technological advancements, strategic realignments in defense policy, and a commitment to building an efficient and effective fighting force capable of meeting future challenges.",479.0,1586.0,2123,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.627575159072876,0.9884033203125,7.6056060791015625,Budget constraints,1.0
"Pesticides may cause acute and delayed health effects in people who are exposed. Pesticide exposure can cause a variety of adverse health effects, ranging from simple irritation of the skin and eyes to more severe effects such as affecting the nervous system, mimicking hormones causing reproductive problems, and also causing cancer. A 2007 systematic review found that ""most studies on non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia showed positive associations with pesticide exposure"" and thus concluded that cosmetic use of pesticides should be decreased. There is substantial evidence of associations between organophosphate insecticide exposures and neurobehavioral alterations.  Limited evidence also exists for other negative outcomes from pesticide exposure including neurological, birth defects, fetal death,",What is thought to possibly cause neurobehavioral alterations?,organophosphate insecticide exposures,2,DESC,"What is thought to possibly cause neurobehavioral alterations?

Relevant context: Neurobehavioral alterations, which refer to changes in behavior and cognitive functions linked to the nervous system, can be caused by a multitude of factors. Researchers have explored both environmental and biological contributors that may lead to these changes in the brain.

First and foremost, genetic predispositions play a significant role in neurobehavioral alterations. Genetic mutations or inherited traits can affect brain development and function, making certain individuals more susceptible to conditions such as autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, and other cognitive impairments.

Environmental factors are also critical in the development of neurobehavioral changes. Exposure to toxins, such as lead, mercury, or pesticides, can have detrimental effects on neurodevelopment. Prenatal exposure to alcohol, drugs, or smoking can result in fetal alcohol syndrome or other neurodevelopmental disorders. Additionally, chronic exposure to stress, whether during crucial developmental periods or across one’s lifetime, has been shown to alter brain function and behavior, likely through the dysregulation of neurohormones and neurotransmitter systems.

Another crucial aspect is the role of infectious agents. Certain viral or bacterial infections, particularly those affecting the central nervous system, can lead to neurobehavioral changes. Examples include congenital infections like those caused by the Zika virus, which can lead to microcephaly and related cognitive impairments.

Inflammation and immune responses have also been implicated in neurobehavioral disorders. Autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis or pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders (PANDAS) associated with streptococcal infections can result in changes to behavior and cognition due to inflammation of brain tissue.

Furthermore, physical trauma, particularly traumatic brain injury (TBI), can cause significant neurobehavioral alterations. The effects of TBI can range from mild cognitive issues to severe and lasting impairments in memory, attention, and emotional regulation. Repeated head injuries, as seen in athletes with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), highlight the long-term impact trauma can have on behavior and cognitive function.

Lastly, lifestyle and psychosocial factors, including poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, and insufficient sleep, can exacerbate or contribute to neurobehavioral changes. These factors can influence brain plasticity and function, potentially leading to or worsening cognitive and behavioral issues.

In summary, neurobehavioral alterations are thought to arise from a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, infectious, inflammatory, and physical factors. Understanding these diverse contributors can inform prevention and treatment strategies for those affected by these changes.",508.0,1690.0,2256,1.0,0.14285714285714285,0.3333333333333333,4.501114368438721,0.9069831371307373,6.366288661956787,Pesticide exposure,0.7

Relevant context: The Canada First Defence Strategy, initiated by the Canadian government, is designed to bolster Canada's defense capabilities primarily within its own borders and territories. However, it also addresses strategic interests and commitments beyond its borders. A key location covered by this strategy, apart from the domestic Canadian landscape, is the Arctic region. Given the increasing importance of the Arctic due to climate change and global geopolitical shifts, the Canada First Defence Strategy emphasizes the Arctic as a critical area for Canada's sovereignty and security interests.

(The results, expressed in retarded or suppressed development, have been modeled in theory by economist Mancur Olson.) In the case of Africa, one of the factors for this behavior was political instability, and the fact that new governments often confiscated previous government's corruptly obtained assets. This encouraged officials to stash their wealth abroad, out of reach of any future expropriation. In contrast, Asian administrations such as Suharto's New Order often took a cut on business transactions or provided conditions for development, through infrastructure investment, law and order, etc.",What was one of the factors for this behavior in Africa?,political instability,2,ENTY,"What was one of the factors for this behavior in Africa?

Relevant context: One of the significant factors that contributed to certain behavioral patterns observed in Africa was the historical and socio-economic impact of colonialism. During the colonial era, European powers imposed artificial borders, lumping together diverse ethnic groups or dividing homogeneous ones. This led to long-lasting ethnic tensions and conflicts, as pre-existing social systems were disrupted. 

Colonial administrations often employed a strategy of divide and rule, which exacerbated rivalries and established hierarchical structures that favored some groups over others. Such dynamics have resulted in deep-rooted mistrust and rivalry between ethnic groups, often resurfacing in post-colonial times as political and social tensions.

Furthermore, the colonial focus on resource extraction and cash crop agriculture disrupted traditional economies and social structures. Local populations were often coerced into labor and were not the primary beneficiaries of the economic gains from their own land. This has led to lasting economic disparities and a reliance on a narrow range of export commodities, affecting local economies and driving urban migration patterns.

Post-independence, many African nations inherited state systems that were not suited to their local contexts, lacking inclusive governance structures. As a result, political instability has sometimes arisen, influencing migration, economic policies, and community behaviors.

Relevant context: Intestinal flora, also known as gut microbiota, plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health by reducing several risk factors and health issues. Firstly, intestinal flora helps to reduce inflammation in the body. A balanced gut microbiota curtails the proliferation of harmful bacteria and promotes the production of anti-inflammatory metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids. This activity can decrease systemic inflammation, which is linked to various chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

Secondly, intestinal flora can help reduce the likelihood of gastrointestinal disorders. By competing with pathogenic microbes and enhancing the intestinal barrier function, a healthy gut flora mitigates risks of infections and conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Additionally, certain probiotics can modulate gut flora to reduce symptoms associated with these disorders.

Furthermore, the microbiota is instrumental in reducing cholesterol levels. Some gut bacteria can metabolize cholesterol into bile acids, which are then excreted, effectively lowering blood cholesterol. This process potentially decreases the risk of developing atherosclerosis and associated heart diseases.

Intestinal flora is also involved in reducing obesity risk. A diverse gut microbiome has been associated with better metabolic health, influencing body weight and fat storage by regulating lipid and glucose metabolism. By influencing energy extraction from food and modulating hormones related to appetite and fat storage, a balanced microbiota supports weight management.

Lastly, gut flora reduces mental health issues through the gut-brain axis. A healthy microbiome produces neurotransmitters and other compounds that can affect brain function and mood, playing a role in reducing the risks of depression and anxiety.

In summary, a well-balanced intestinal flora can reduce inflammation, gastrointestinal disorders, cholesterol levels, obesity risk, and mental health issues, highlighting its critical importance for overall well-being.",363.0,1729.0,2145,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.528678894042969,1.182530403137207,8.688520431518555,Pathogenic bacteria,0.0

"The apartheid bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria in the Population Registration Act of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group. Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications. When it was unclear from a person's physical appearance whether the individual should be considered Coloured or Black, the ""pencil test"" was used. A pencil was inserted into a person's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough to hold the pencil, rather than having it pass through, as it would with smoother hair. If so, the person was classified as Black. Such classifications sometimes divided families.",What test was used to determine if someone was coloured or black?,pencil test,2,ENTY,"What test was used to determine if someone was coloured or black?

Relevant context: In the context of South Africa's apartheid era, racial classification was a cornerstone of the segregationist policies enforced by the government. One of the most notorious methods used to determine racial categorizations was the ""pencil test."" This crude test was emblematic of the arbitrary nature of racial classification during this period.

The pencil test was employed as a means to decide whether individuals were classified as ""coloured"" or ""black."" This classification had profound implications for rights, freedoms, and social standing in the apartheid system. To perform the test, a government official or inspector would place a pencil in a person's hair. If the pencil fell out, the individual could be classified as ""coloured."" However, if the pencil stayed in the hair, the person risked being classified as ""black.""

The test itself was based on the texture and curliness of hair, with the underlying and prejudicial assumption that these traits could demarcate racial boundaries. The pencil test was not an official or scientifically recognized method, and it underscored the arbitrary and pseudoscientific approaches used by the apartheid government to enforce racial divisions.

These classifications were not only deeply dehumanizing but also had tangible effects on a person’s life, determining where they could live, what jobs they could hold, and whether they could interact with people classified as other races. The pencil test, among other methods, highlighted the absurdity and cruelty of the racial policies at the time.

This classification was part of a broader set of race laws, including the Population Registration Act of 1950, which required South Africans to be classified into racial groups. These classifications were then used to enforce other apartheid laws, which dictated every aspect of life in South Africa, including who people could marry and where they could reside.

In summary, the pencil test is a well-remembered example of the arbitrary and oppressive measures used to classify individuals by race during the apartheid era in South Africa. It stands as a historical reminder of the injustices endured by those subjected to such dehumanizing policies.",425.0,1629.0,2113,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.154198884963989,0.8971288204193115,5.989130973815918,Pencil test,1.0
"The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, and not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety. Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which, according to the hygiene hypothesis, can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves, but also to act as facilitators of social interactions between humans. One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when they are accompanied by a dog than when they are not. In 2015, a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners.",What do humans get exposed to with pets that may help them not get sick?,immune-stimulating microorganisms,2,ENTY,"What do humans get exposed to with pets that may help them not get sick?

Relevant context: When humans share their lives with pets, they are exposed to a variety of biological and environmental factors that can enhance their immune function and potentially reduce the likelihood of certain illnesses. One of the primary benefits of having pets is the increased exposure to diverse microbes. Pets, particularly dogs and cats, often bring in bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms from the outside environment into the home. This heightened microbial diversity may help to strengthen the human immune system, training it to better differentiate between harmful pathogens and benign substances.

Exposure to pet dander, especially from cats and dogs, can also play a role in developing a more tolerant immune system. Dander, which consists of tiny flecks of skin and proteins from saliva and urine, can influence the human body to produce antibodies that help to reduce the risk of allergic reactions and asthma. Moreover, studies have shown that children growing up in households with pets are less likely to develop allergies and asthma compared to those without pets. This is because their immune systems are ""primed"" to expect and handle these allergens from a young age.

Pets also contribute to better health through indirect means. For instance, pet ownership often encourages increased physical activity, especially for dog owners who walk their pets regularly. This increased activity can improve cardiovascular health, boost mood, and enhance overall physical well-being, further fortifying the body against illness. Additionally, the companionship and emotional support provided by pets can reduce stress, a factor known to weaken the immune system. By lowering stress levels, pets help to keep the body's defenses robust and more capable of fending off infections.

Moreover, owning a pet has been associated with changes in human microbiota—which is the collection of microorganisms living in and on our bodies—to a state that may be more protective against some diseases. The presence of certain bacteria transmitted from pets could reinforce beneficial bacteria in humans, contributing to a healthier gut flora known to play a crucial role in immune system regulation.

In summary, while the presence of pets in the home introduces humans to a wider array of microorganisms, allergens, and opportunities for physical and emotional benefits, these exposures collectively support a healthier immune system and a lower incidence of certain illnesses.",449.0,1333.0,1844,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.243360757827759,0.9403557777404785,8.115832567214966,Microorganisms,0.8
The prevalence of HIV-infection among the adult population is 1.8%. Only 20% of infected pregnant women receive anti retroviral coverage to prevent transmission to newborns.,What does retroviral coverage help prevent?,transmission to newborns,2,ENTY,"What does retroviral coverage help prevent?

Relevant context: Retroviral coverage plays a crucial role in preventing the replication and progression of retrovirus infections, most notably HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). Retroviruses are a family of viruses characterized by their ability to integrate their genetic material into the host cell's DNA, allowing them to systematically take over the cell’s machinery to propagate. This integration is facilitated by the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which converts the virus's RNA into DNA.

Retroviral coverage typically refers to the administration of antiretroviral drugs, which are specifically designed to interfere with different stages of the retrovirus life cycle. The primary purpose of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is to reduce the viral load within an infected individual to undetectable levels, thereby preventing the progression to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) in HIV-positive patients. This treatment not only improves individual health outcomes by restoring and preserving immune function but also reduces the risk of transmission of the virus to others, serving a public health benefit.

Moreover, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a form of retroviral coverage, is utilized to prevent HIV in individuals at high risk of infection. PrEP involves taking a daily dose of antiretroviral medications to significantly reduce the likelihood of acquiring HIV upon exposure. This preventive measure is critical in populations with higher incidence rates, contributing to broader efforts in controlling the spread of HIV.

In addition to HIV, retroviral coverage can be applicable to other diseases caused by retroviruses, including certain types of cancer such as HTLV-1 associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. By controlling viral reproduction and mitigating disease progression, retroviral coverage represents a vital component in both individual patient care and collective public health strategies. 

Overall, the major benefit of retroviral coverage lies in its comprehensive ability to manage existing infections, prevent new infections, and reduce the global burden of diseases caused by retroviruses.",390.0,1471.0,1916,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.218147039413452,1.0080232620239258,6.209153890609741,Transmission to newborns,1.0
"FDR's New Deal programs often contained equal opportunity clauses stating ""no discrimination shall be made on account of race, color or creed"",:11 but the true forerunner to affirmative action was the Interior Secretary of the time, Harold L. Ickes. Ickes prohibited discrimination in hiring for Public Works Administration funded projects and oversaw not only the institution of a quota system, where contractors were required to employ a fixed percentage of Black workers, by Robert C. Weaver and Clark Foreman,:12 but also the equal pay of women proposed by Harry Hopkins.:14FDR's largest contribution to affirmative action, however, lay in his Executive Order 8802 which prohibited discrimination in the defense industry or government.:22 The executive order promoted the idea that if taxpayer funds were accepted through a government contract, then all taxpayers should have an equal opportunity to work through the contractor.:23–4 To enforce this idea, Roosevelt created the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) with the power to investigate hiring practices by government contractors.:22",Which piece of legislation prevented any discrimination in the defense industry and government?,Executive Order 8802,2,ENTY,"Which piece of legislation prevented any discrimination in the defense industry and government?

Relevant context: In response to widespread discrimination in employment practices within the defense industry during World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 on June 25, 1941. This piece of legislation was pivotal because it specifically mandated that there would be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin. The executive order came after significant pressure from civil rights advocates, including A. Philip Randolph, who threatened a large march on Washington to protest against employment discrimination.

Executive Order 8802 declared that federal agencies and all unions and companies engaged in war-related work had to ensure fair employment practices. To enforce this directive, the order also established the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC), which was responsible for investigating complaints of discrimination and monitoring compliance with the anti-discrimination stipulations. Although the order did not outlaw discriminatory practices outright, it was a crucial step towards ensuring equal employment opportunities during the war effort and set the groundwork for future civil rights advancements.

This executive action marked the first time that the United States government had taken significant steps to fight racial discrimination at a national level, particularly in industries critical to the national defense. It served as an essential precursor to later civil rights legislation by demonstrating that the federal government could and would intervene in cases of racial discrimination within industries tied to national interests.",287.0,2006.0,2355,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.478464126586914,1.020918607711792,8.548710346221924,Executive Order 8802,1.0
"The country currency is the Samoan tālā, issued and regulated by the Central Bank of Samoa. The economy of Samoa has traditionally been dependent on agriculture and fishing at the local level. In modern times, development aid, private family remittances from overseas, and agricultural exports have become key factors in the nation's economy. Agriculture employs two-thirds of the labour force, and furnishes 90% of exports, featuring coconut cream, coconut oil, noni (juice of the nonu fruit, as it is known in Samoan), and copra.","In addition to agriculture, what industry historically supported Samoa's local economy?",fishing,2,ENTY,"In addition to agriculture, what industry historically supported Samoa's local economy?

Relevant context: In addition to agriculture, which has been the cornerstone of Samoa's local economy for generations, the fishing industry has historically played a crucial role in supporting the livelihoods of many Samoan families. The islands of Samoa, surrounded by the vast Pacific Ocean, boast rich marine resources that have long been tapped for both subsistence and commercial purposes. Traditional fishing methods, such as the use of outrigger canoes and woven nets, highlight the deep cultural connection the Samoan people have with the sea.

Over the years, fishing in Samoa evolved beyond subsistence practices to become more commercialized, contributing significantly to the nation's gross domestic product. Coastal and offshore fishing operations target an array of species, including tuna, which is one of the major exports. The development of fish processing facilities has further enhanced the industry's capacity, allowing Samoa to engage in global trade and support an export market that extends to countries that include Japan, the United States, and Europe.

In addition to commercial fishing, the industry also supports a vibrant local market. Fish is a staple in the Samoan diet, and local fish markets provide a direct outlet for fresh catches, ensuring food security for the population. Beyond economic contributions, fishing in Samoa is deeply interwoven with societal practices and communal living, often characterized by shared fishing expeditions and the communal distribution of catches.

During the late 20th century and into the 21st century, efforts to ensure sustainable fishing practices have been emphasized, mitigating the impacts of overfishing and environmental degradation. Programs to protect marine biodiversity and replenish fish stocks have been initiated, thus ensuring the longevity of the fishing industry as a vital component of Samoa's local economy. This strategic approach not only safeguards the environment but also supports the economic infrastructure upon which many Samoan communities continue to rely.

Relevant context: In 1850, one notable completion that stands out is the construction of the Église de la Madeleine, or more commonly referred to as La Madeleine, in Paris, France. This stunning church, designed as a neoclassical temple to the glory of Napoleon's army, had its inception in 1807. However, due to various political upheavals and changes in governance, its completion was delayed multiple times, switching between being intended as a temple, a railway station, and a national library, among other purposes.

The construction of La Madeleine went through the hands of several architects, beginning with Pierre-Alexandre Vignon. The final stage of its construction was overseen by Jean-Jacques-Marie Huvé, who ultimately completed the building in the style initially envisioned by Vignon. The church officially opened for use on July 24, 1842, but the decorative interior and exterior fittings took several more years.

The exterior of La Madeleine is characterized by its 52 Corinthian columns, each 20 meters high, giving it the appearance of a Greek temple that would not be out of place amidst ancient ruins. The interior decor, which further contributed to the delay, was characterized by its rich artworks, including sculptures and reliefs. Finally, in 1850, the last touches were put in place, completing both its external carvings and intriguing chapels within.

Relevant context: Following the legislative changes introduced by the East India Company Act of 1803, a significant development was the formal designation of a dedicated export dock for the East India Company's operations in London. This dock was known as the East India Dock and was specifically constructed to accommodate the increased scale of the Company's trading activities, particularly aimed at streamlining the exportation process of goods between Britain and its territories in India.

The creation of the East India Dock was a strategic response to the growing demand for better infrastructure to handle the burgeoning trade of commodities such as tea, textiles, and spices, which the Company was renowned for. This dock became part of a larger dock complex in the region of Blackwall in the East End of London. It was engineered to accommodate large ships, improve loading efficiency, and reduce logistical bottlenecks that had previously plagued the Company's shipping operations.

The East India Dock's establishment was also a reflection of the increasing importance of maritime trade routes and the need for improved facilities to maintain England's competitive edge in global commerce during the early 19th century. It played a crucial role in facilitating the economic activities of the East India Company until its dissolution in the mid-19th century.

Relevant context: Swift boats, formally known as Patrol Craft, Fast, or PCFs, were a class of small, fast naval vessels employed by the United States Navy primarily during the Vietnam War. Designed for their speed and agility, these boats were tasked with patrolling the shallow coastal waters, rivers, and canals that were prevalent in the Southeast Asian landscape. The swift boats played a crucial role in Operation Market Time, which aimed to intercept the movement of arms and supplies by the Viet Cong along the waters of South Vietnam.

The PCFs were characterized by their lightweight aluminum hulls, their length of 50 feet, and their capability of reaching speeds up to 28 knots. Typically, swift boats were manned by a crew of six, including a commanding officer, and were armed with a combination of machine guns and small cannon, making them suitable for their intended inshore operations. The production of PCFs began in the mid-1960s by shipbuilders such as Sewart Seacraft and Marinette Marine, reflecting an urgent need for vessels capable of performing both offensive and transport duties in environments conventional larger warships found challenging.

Swift boats became well-known for their versatility and effectiveness in interdiction and support missions, as well as for their involvement in various clandestine and direct action operations against enemy forces.

"The end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country and by function. Furthermore, even within a single nation state or culture there can be different ages at which an individual is considered (chronologically and legally) mature enough for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities. Such milestones include driving a vehicle, having legal sexual relations, serving in the armed forces or on a jury, purchasing and drinking alcohol, voting, entering into contracts, finishing certain levels of education, and marriage. Adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians, including less supervision as compared to preadolescence.",Is adolescence usually accompanied by increased parental supervision or increased independence?,independence,2,ENTY,"Is adolescence usually accompanied by increased parental supervision or increased independence?

Relevant context: Adolescence is a pivotal stage in human development, marked by significant physical, emotional, and cognitive changes. It is during this time that young individuals transition from childhood to adulthood, experiencing a tension between increased parental supervision and the desire for greater independence.

Typically, adolescence is characterized by a shift towards increased independence, as teenagers strive to establish their own identities separate from their parents. This quest for autonomy is driven by cognitive developments that allow for more advanced reasoning and decision-making capabilities, as well as a natural inclination to explore personal interests and peer relationships. Adolescents begin to seek more freedom in various aspects of their lives, such as managing their social interactions, making academic and career-related choices, and exploring their personal beliefs and values.

However, this push for independence does not necessarily mean that parental supervision diminishes completely. Many parents respond to this period by adjusting the nature of their supervision rather than the extent. Instead of closely monitoring every aspect of their child's life, parents might adopt a more supportive role, offering guidance and setting boundaries that aim to ensure safety and promote healthy development. This can include open communication about expectations, values, and the consequences of certain behaviors. The goal is often to find a balance between granting freedom and maintaining an appropriate level of oversight to prevent risky behaviors typically associated with adolescence, such as experimenting with alcohol, drugs, and sexual activity.

Cultural and individual differences can significantly influence how this balance is struck. In some cultures or families, there may be a stronger emphasis on collective values and protective oversight, resulting in prolonged parental involvement in decision-making. Conversely, in other settings, teenagers might experience a more pronounced expectation for self-reliance and personal responsibility.

In summary, while adolescence generally involves a movement towards increased independence, it is often accompanied by adapted parental supervision that seeks to support this new autonomy while ensuring the teenager's well-being and personal growth. The extent of independence afforded, and the nature of parental supervision, can vary widely based on cultural norms, family dynamics, and individual needs.",415.0,1722.0,2195,1.0,0.25,0.43067655807339306,7.829580068588257,0.9899733066558838,9.748970985412598,Increased independence,0.8

Relevant context: The first computer that became available to the public for personal use was the MITS Altair 8800, introduced in January 1975. This pioneering piece of technology was developed by Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), a small company based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The brainchild of Ed Roberts, the Altair caught the attention of hobbyists and enthusiasts eager to explore the growing field of personal computing.

The Altair 8800 was initially sold as a kit, which required the user to assemble the components themselves. Priced at $439, this kit included an Intel 8080 CPU, 256 bytes of RAM, and came with a simple toggle switch panel for input and a row of lights for output, lacking both a keyboard and a monitor. Despite its rudimentary interface, the Altair tapped into a burgeoning culture of computer hobbyists and quickly gained popularity after appearing on the cover of the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine.

This milestone in computing was significant as it marked the democratization of computer technology, previously the realm of large, expensive systems owned by corporations and universities. The interest generated by the Altair led to the formation of user groups like the Homebrew Computer Club, where many influential figures in the personal computer revolution, such as Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, shared ideas and developed innovations.

Moreover, the Altair 8800 set the stage for the software industry, as the young duo of Bill Gates and Paul Allen created a version of the BASIC programming language to run on the machine, founding what would later become Microsoft Corporation. This development paved the way for accessible software that allowed users to interact more intuitively with their computers.

"On 6 April 2011, after his proposed ""Plan for Stability and Growth IV"" (PEC IV) was rejected by the Parliament, Prime Minister José Sócrates announced on national television that the country would request financial assistance from the IMF and the European Financial Stability Facility, as Greece and the Republic of Ireland had done previously. It was the third time that the Portuguese government had requested external financial aid from the IMF—the first occasion occurred in the late 1970s following the Carnation's Revolution. In October 2011, Moody's Investor Services downgraded nine Portuguese banks due to financial weakness.",What provoked the first request from Portugal for financial support?,Carnation's Revolution,2,ENTY,"What provoked the first request from Portugal for financial support?

Relevant context: In 2010, Portugal found itself in a precarious economic situation that ultimately led to its first request for financial support from international lenders. This request for a bailout was primarily provoked by escalating concerns over the country's ballooning public debt, unsustainable fiscal deficits, and the broader impacts of the European debt crisis that had already ensnared Greece and Ireland.

The roots of Portugal's fiscal troubles date back to the early 2000s, when the country struggled to boost its sluggish economic growth despite substantial public investment. By the end of the decade, the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 had further exacerbated Portugal’s economic woes, leading to stagnation and increasing pressure on public finances. The government's persistent budget deficits led to a rising national debt, which was met with growing anxiety from financial markets.

As 2010 progressed, the situation in the Eurozone became increasingly volatile. Investors viewed Portugal as a high-risk borrower, leading to a spike in the yields on Portuguese government bonds. The soaring costs of borrowing made it ever more challenging for Portugal to manage its debt sustainably. Political instability further complicated matters when the Portuguese government, led by Prime Minister José Sócrates, faced fierce opposition to austerity measures aimed at cutting the deficit. This political strife came to a head in March 2011, when the parliament rejected a proposed austerity package, triggering the resignation of the Prime Minister and leading to a political crisis.

Amid this turmoil, Portugal’s access to international capital markets significantly curtailed. With the government unable to pass necessary fiscal reforms and the market conditions deteriorating rapidly, Portugal's financial situation became untenable. The specter of default loomed large, prompting the Portuguese government to formally request a bailout in April 2011.

Portugal's appeal for international assistance resulted in a €78 billion financial aid package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This bailout was aimed at stabilizing Portugal's financial system, restoring market confidence, and putting the nation's public finances on a more sustainable path. In return, Portugal agreed to implement stringent austerity measures, structural reforms, and fiscal consolidation policies to ensure long-term recovery and stability.

Thus, the first request for financial support was provoked by a confluence of internal economic weaknesses, political instability, and the broader European sovereign debt crisis, which together created an unsustainable fiscal situation that necessitated international intervention.",497.0,1645.0,2200,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,5.658355951309204,0.9410808086395264,7.5263307094573975,Carnation Revolution,0.9
"The Ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the Middle East in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler's power, and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous. The ultimate aim was to increase the state revenues without damaging the prosperity of subjects to prevent the emergence of social disorder and to keep the traditional organization of the society intact.",What did the state economic system hope to avoid?,the emergence of social disorder,2,ENTY,"What did the state economic system hope to avoid?

Relevant context: The state economic system, particularly in centralized economies, sought to avoid several critical pitfalls that could undermine its efficacy and stability. These include:

1. **Market Volatility and Instability**: By centralizing economic control, the state aimed to avoid the unpredictable fluctuations commonly seen in free markets. Such volatility can lead to inflation, unemployment, and inequality, all of which are destabilizing for economies and disruptive to social harmony.

2. **Resource Allocation Inefficiencies**: In free-market systems, resources can be allocated inefficiently, driven by profit motives rather than societal needs. The state economic system attempts to avoid this by planning and directing resources towards sectors that benefit the entire population, ensuring that essential services and goods are available to all, regardless of market demand.

3. **Economic Disparities**: A key goal was to avoid the economic disparities that can arise in capitalist systems, where wealth can become concentrated in the hands of a few. By controlling key industries and redistributing wealth through state intervention, the government works to create a more equitable economic landscape.

4. **Dependence on Foreign Entities**: By promoting self-sufficiency and reducing reliance on foreign markets and imports, the state hoped to insulate its economy from external economic pressures and political influences that could be damaging.

5. **Unemployment**: State-directed economies strive to maintain full employment by directly allocating jobs and creating work opportunities through state-run enterprises and infrastructure projects. Avoiding the social and economic costs of unemployment is a central objective of such systems.

6. **Overproduction and Underproduction**: Through careful economic planning, the state aims to avoid the cyclical issues of overproduction and underproduction that can lead to waste and scarcity. By forecasting needs and adjusting production accordingly, the system seeks a steady state of supply and demand.

Overall, the state economic system's primary concerns revolved around maintaining stability, equality, and self-reliance, while ensuring that economic activities aligned with broader social and political goals.

"Most CBC television stations, including those in the major cities, are owned and operated by the CBC itself. CBC O&O stations operate as a mostly seamless national service with few deviations from the main network schedule, although there are some regional differences from time to time. For on-air identification, most CBC stations use the CBC brand rather than their call letters, not identifying themselves specifically until sign-on or sign-off (though some, like Toronto's CBLT, do not ID themselves at all except through PSIP). All CBC O&O stations have a standard call letter naming convention, in that the first two letters are ""CB"" (an ITU prefix allocated not to Canada, but to Chile) and the last letter is ""T"". Only the third letter varies from market to market; however, that letter is typically the same as the third letter of the CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 stations in the same market. An exception to this rule are the CBC North stations in Yellowknife, Whitehorse and Iqaluit, whose call signs begin with ""CF"" due to their historic association with the CBC's Frontier Coverage Package prior to the advent of microwave and satellite broadcasting.",What are the first two letters of nearly all CBC stations?,"""CB""",2,ENTY,"What are the first two letters of nearly all CBC stations?

"In the US Air Force, the distinction between bombers, fighters that are actually fighter-bombers, and attack aircraft has become blurred. Many attack aircraft, even ones that look like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Many fighter aircraft, such as the F-16, are often used as 'bomb trucks', despite being designed for aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations. The US, Russia, and the People's Republic of China operate strategic bombers.",What type of USAF aircraft is designed for long range airstrike attacks? ,bomber,2,ENTY,"What type of USAF aircraft is designed for long range airstrike attacks? 

Relevant context: The United States Air Force employs several aircraft designed for long range airstrike capabilities, with a primary focus on strategic bombers. Among these, the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress stands out as one of the most iconic and enduring aircraft in this category. First introduced in the 1950s, the B-52 has been a cornerstone of the U.S. strategic bomber fleet due to its remarkable range, payload capacity, and adaptability to modern warfare requirements.

Capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and altitudes up to 50,000 feet, the B-52 can carry a variety of weapons, including conventional and nuclear payloads. Its long range allows it to strike targets across the globe with air refueling, making it an indispensable tool in the U.S. military's capacity to conduct long-distance missions without the need for forward bases.

In addition to the B-52, the USAF operates the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit, a stealth bomber that exemplifies advanced technology and long-range precision strike capabilities. The B-2's key advantage is its stealth design, enabling it to penetrate dense anti-aircraft defenses and conduct surprise attacks. It has a significant range and payload, allowing it to deploy both conventional and nuclear weapons while evading enemy radar.

Another modern aircraft designed for this role is the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider, which is being developed with a focus on next-generation stealth technology, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. Once operational, the B-21 is expected to complement the existing fleet, enhancing the USAF’s ability to project power globally with an emphasis on penetrating adversary airspace where advanced defensive systems are likely to be employed.

These strategic bombers are integral to the United States' defense strategy, serving not only as tools for deterrence but also as key elements in their capacity to conduct long-range strike missions across the globe. With ongoing upgrades and advancements, these aircraft continue to evolve, ensuring that they remain effective components of modern air combat operations.",426.0,1619.0,2105,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.541724443435669,1.127084493637085,16.68556809425354,Bomber,0.9
"The major application of uranium in the military sector is in high-density penetrators. This ammunition consists of depleted uranium (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements, such as titanium or molybdenum. At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates. The use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after the use of such munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil (see Gulf War Syndrome).",What illness is possibly tied to the use of depleted uranium munitions?,Gulf War Syndrome,2,ENTY,"What illness is possibly tied to the use of depleted uranium munitions?

Relevant context: Depleted uranium (DU) munitions, which have been used extensively in military conflicts, have raised significant health concerns and controversies. These munitions are favored in combat due to their high density, which allows them to easily penetrate armored targets. However, questions have been raised about their potential long-term health effects on both military personnel and civilian populations.

One of the primary illnesses potentially linked to the exposure of depleted uranium is a set of conditions collectively referred to as ""Gulf War Syndrome"" or ""Gulf War Illness."" This illness encompasses a range of chronic symptoms that have been reported by veterans of the 1990-1991 Gulf War. Symptoms often include fatigue, headaches, joint pain, skin disorders, neurocognitive deficits, and respiratory disorders. While the exact cause of Gulf War Syndrome remains elusive, depleted uranium exposure is one of several environmental factors considered a possible contributor.

Scientific studies attempting to establish a direct causal link between DU exposure and specific health outcomes have been challenging due to the complex nature of such exposures and the presence of multiple confounding factors in war zones. Depleted uranium is a weakly radioactive substance that, when used in munitions, can generate aerosolized particles upon impact. Inhaling or ingesting these particles can lead to internal exposure, raising concerns about potential carcinogenic effects and kidney damage due to uranium's chemical toxicity.

Despite these concerns, evidence remains inconclusive, and debates continue among researchers. Some studies have found instances of kidney damage, respiratory issues, and increased cancer risks in populations with known exposure to depleted uranium, whereas other studies have not demonstrated significant health risks. This lack of consensus underscores the need for further, long-term epidemiological research to clarify the potential health impacts associated with DU munitions.

In conclusion, while the use of depleted uranium munitions is tied to concerns about Gulf War Syndrome and potential health impacts, definitive scientific evidence linking DU exposure to specific illnesses remains a subject of ongoing investigation and debate. The multifactorial nature of illness in conflict zones and the intricate science of toxicology and radiology complicate the establishment of a direct causal link.

"In the European Union, the principle of subsidiarity is applied: a government service should be provided by the lowest, most local authority that can competently provide it. An effect is that distribution of funds into multiple instances discourages embezzlement, because even small sums missing will be noticed. In contrast, in a centralized authority, even minute proportions of public funds can be large sums of money.",Providing a government service from the lowest form of local government that can adequately provide the service is called what?,principle of subsidiarity,2,ENTY,"Providing a government service from the lowest form of local government that can adequately provide the service is called what?

Relevant context: The concept you're referring to is known as ""subsidiarity."" Subsidiarity is a principle in political and administrative law that suggests that matters should be handled by the smallest, lowest, or least centralized competent authority. This principle is designed to ensure that decisions are made as closely as possible to the citizens they affect, with a larger role assigned to higher levels of government only when issues cannot be effectively addressed by local authorities.

Subsidiarity has its origins in both Catholic social teaching and secular political theory, and is prominently recognized in the governance structures of organizations such as the European Union. The idea is that local governments, being closer to the populace, are more in tune with the specific needs and conditions of their communities. Thus, they are often better positioned to provide services efficiently and responsively.

For example, local municipalities might handle community services like waste management, local road maintenance, and libraries. When issues like public transportation or regional infrastructure require broader coordination, they might be escalated to a county or metropolitan authority.

Subsidiarity promotes efficiency by empowering local governments to address local issues directly without unnecessary bureaucratic intervention from higher levels of government. It also nurtures democratic participation and accountability, as citizens have more direct access and influence over the authorities responsible for these services.

In essence, the principle of subsidiarity seeks to balance power and responsibility across different levels of government, championing local autonomy while ensuring that larger entities step in when necessary to manage issues that exceed local capacities.",317.0,1218.0,1602,1.0,1.0,1.0,15.607491493225098,2.0590391159057617,18.78027868270874,Subsidiarity,0.8

The report is then analyzed to determine whether or not the entire rail is safe to use.",What part of the mine shaft requires routine testing?,elevator rails,2,ENTY,"What part of the mine shaft requires routine testing?

Relevant context: The most critical part of a mine shaft that requires routine testing is the shaft lining and structural integrity, including the timber, concrete, steel, and support bolts. These elements are crucial in maintaining the stability of the mine shaft and ensuring the safety of the personnel working within the mine.

Routine testing and inspection should focus on detecting any signs of wear, corrosion, or damage to the support structures. These checks often include visual inspections for visible cracks, spalls, or deformation in concrete linings, as well as non-destructive testing methods such as ultrasonic testing or radiography to assess the integrity of steel beams and bolts. Additionally, stress testing may be conducted on timber supports to ensure they can withstand the weight and pressure exerted by the surrounding earth and equipment.

Another key aspect of routine testing is the examination of the shaft's ventilation system, as proper airflow is critical in preventing the buildup of harmful gases and ensuring a safe breathing environment. This involves testing the operation of fans and ventilation pathways for blockages or leaks.

Finally, electrical systems and equipment such as the lift and hoisting mechanisms should also be regularly tested for functionality and safety to prevent mechanical failures that could lead to accidents or entrapment.

"Ehrlich’s approach of systematically varying the chemical structure of synthetic compounds and measuring the effects of these changes on biological activity was pursued broadly by industrial scientists, including Bayer scientists Josef Klarer, Fritz Mietzsch, and Gerhard Domagk. This work, also based in the testing of compounds available from the German dye industry, led to the development of Prontosil, the first representative of the sulfonamide class of antibiotics. Compared to arsphenamine, the sulfonamides had a broader spectrum of activity and were far less toxic, rendering them useful for infections caused by pathogens such as streptococci. In 1939, Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery. Nonetheless, the dramatic decrease in deaths from infectious diseases that occurred prior to World War II was primarily the result of improved public health measures such as clean water and less crowded housing, and the impact of anti-infective drugs and vaccines was significant mainly after World War II.",Were sulfonamides more or less toxic than arsphenamine?,less,2,ENTY,"Were sulfonamides more or less toxic than arsphenamine?

Relevant context: In the early 20th century, both sulfonamides and arsphenamine were groundbreaking in the treatment of bacterial infections. However, they differed in terms of toxicity and side effects. Arsphenamine, also known by its trade name Salvarsan, was introduced in 1910 as the first effective treatment for syphilis. It was a compound that contained arsenic, which inherently posed significant risks. The administration of arsphenamine required precise intravenous delivery under careful medical supervision to manage its potential for serious toxic effects. Among these were nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and neurotoxicity, due to its arsenic content. The introduction of this drug truly marked a revolution in antimicrobial therapy, but it came with considerable safety concerns due to its toxic nature.

In contrast, sulfonamides, introduced in the 1930s, were the first broadly effective antibacterial agents that could be taken orally. They represented a significant leap forward in treating a variety of bacterial infections with a broader safety profile compared to arsphenamine. While not without their own side effects – such as hypersensitivity reactions, skin rashes, and kidney damage due to crystalluria – sulfonamides were generally less toxic than arsphenamine. These drugs could be administered more easily and with greater safety, allowing for more widespread treatment use outside specialized medical settings.

In conclusion, while both arsphenamine and sulfonamides were critical advances in their respective times, sulfonamides were generally considered to be less toxic than arsphenamine, making them a safer option for a wider range of patients. The comparative safety of sulfonamides helped pave the way for further development of antibacterial therapies.",354.0,1819.0,2232,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,6.618938446044922,1.1116786003112793,8.94753646850586,Less toxic,0.5
"Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of Anthropology, Bronislaw Malinowski, and his French compatriot, Marcel Mauss, on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or reciprocity) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast. Economic Anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective.",Which branch of anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior?,Economic,2,ENTY,"Which branch of anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior?

Relevant context: The branch of anthropology that specifically attempts to explain human economic behavior is known as economic anthropology. This subfield explores how humans produce, distribute, exchange, and consume resources within their cultural contexts. Unlike conventional economics, which often focuses on quantitative data and models, economic anthropology takes a holistic, comparative approach, emphasizing the social relations and cultural beliefs that influence economic behavior in different societies.

Economic anthropologists are primarily concerned with understanding how different cultures organize their economies and the meanings that individuals and communities ascribe to their economic activities. They investigate a wide range of economic practices, from hunting and gathering to industrial production, examining how these practices intersect with kinship, gender, political power, and religion.

Several theoretical frameworks have emerged within economic anthropology, with the prime focus areas being the substantivist and formalist debates. Substantivists argue that economic action is embedded in social institutions and cannot be explained using Western economic theories alone. In contrast, formalists assert that the principles of Western economics can be applied universally to explain human economic behavior.

Key figures in the development of economic anthropology include Karl Polanyi, who introduced the concepts of formalist and substantivist approaches, and Marcel Mauss, whose work on gift economies highlighted the role of reciprocity and exchange in social cohesion. This field continues to evolve, addressing contemporary issues such as globalization, neoliberalism, and the impacts of technological advances on economic systems worldwide.

By integrating ethnographic research methods, such as participant observation and interviews, economic anthropologists provide rich, qualitative insights into how and why economic systems function the way they do in various cultures, offering a more nuanced understanding of human economic behavior.",342.0,1316.0,1714,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.1121087074279785,1.9402828216552734,6.400150537490845,Economic anthropology,0.5

Relevant context: The first carrier-launched airstrike in history occurred during World War I, marking a pivotal point in naval aviation and military strategy. On July 19, 1918, the British Royal Navy executed this groundbreaking operation using the aircraft carrier HMS Furious. The mission targeted the Tondern airship base, located in then-German territory (now part of Denmark), which was used for launching Zeppelin raids on the United Kingdom.

HMS Furious, initially laid down as a battlecruiser, had been converted to an aircraft carrier with a flight deck, enabling it to launch aircraft directly from the ship. This innovative design allowed it to carry and deploy several Sopwith Camel biplanes specifically adapted for the task.

In the early hours of the morning, a squadron of seven Sopwith Camels, each armed with bombs, took off from the deck of HMS Furious, beginning their mission over the North Sea. This daring raid, designated as Operation F.7, saw the pilots fly over 90 miles to reach their target. Upon arrival, the Camels released their payload, achieving significant success by destroying two Zeppelin airships, L 54 and L 60, and damaging the airship sheds.

This historic airstrike demonstrated the potential of carrier-based aviation to project military power beyond the reach of traditional naval guns. It highlighted the utility of aircraft carriers as strategic assets in controlling the airspace over and around naval operations, setting a precedent for future naval battles.

The Tondern Raid underscored the importance of aviation in naval warfare and initiated a new era where aircraft carriers became central to naval strategy, influencing military tactics in subsequent wars. This operation would pave the way for the development of more advanced carriers and aircraft, playing a crucial role in naval confrontations during World War II and beyond.",374.0,1833.0,2264,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.328335762023926,1.2198116779327393,6.634615182876587,Tondern Raid,0.8
"Under Article IV, Section Three of the United States Constitution, which outlines the relationship among the states, Congress has the power to admit new states to the union.

Relevant context: Article IV, Section 3 of the United States Constitution addresses the admission of new states into the Union and provides the governance framework for territories and property belonging to the United States. This section consists of two main clauses, each with distinct purposes and implications:

Firstly, the New States Clause establishes the procedure for admitting new states into the Union. It explicitly grants Congress the power to admit new states. Importantly, it includes stipulations that new states cannot be formed within the jurisdiction of existing states, nor can states be created by merging two or more states, or parts of states, without the consent of the concerned states’ legislatures, as well as Congress. This clause ensures that the creation of new states happens with appropriate deliberation and consent, maintaining the balance of power and territorial integrity within the country.

Secondly, the Territorial Clause grants Congress the authority to dispose of and regulate territories and other federal properties. This clause gives Congress broad power over federal lands and territories not yet incorporated as states. This includes making all needful rules and regulations regarding these territories, ensuring that they are governed in a manner consistent with federal interests and policies until such time as they may become eligible for statehood themselves.

Together, these clauses under Article IV, Section 3, highlight the importance of legislative oversight in both the expansion of the United States through the admission of new states and the management of territories. They reflect the framework intended by the framers of the Constitution for orderly growth and governance, while also emphasizing the importance of existing states' consent when altering boundaries or creating new states from existing ones.

"Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, and bumping the ""funny bone"". Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: ""Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage."" In medical diagnosis, pain is a symptom.",What type of feeling is pain?,distressing,2,ENTY,"What type of feeling is pain?

Relevant context: Pain is a complex sensation that serves as a crucial biological signal indicating that something may be wrong within the body. At its core, pain is a subjective experience, meaning it can vary dramatically from person to person. It is typically perceived as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that is associated with actual or potential tissue damage. This perception is often processed through nociceptors, which are specialized nerve endings located throughout the body. When these nociceptors detect a harmful stimulus, such as injury, they transmit signals through nerve pathways to the brain, where the sensation of pain is ultimately interpreted. 

Pain can be broadly categorized into two main types: acute and chronic. Acute pain serves as an immediate warning of an injury or threat to the body, prompting us to withdraw from the harmful stimulus and seek care, thus playing a key protective and healing role. In contrast, chronic pain persists for weeks, months, or even years, beyond the typical healing period, and can significantly diminish quality of life.

Emotional and psychological factors also influence the experience of pain. For instance, stress, anxiety, and mood can amplify the perception of pain, whereas positive emotions or distractions can reduce it. This is why pain is often managed not only with medication, such as analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but also with psychological therapies like cognitive-behavioral therapy, which helps patients develop strategies to cope with the emotional aspects of pain.

In addition to physical sensations, pain is associated with a range of emotional responses, and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish these from the physical sensations. For example, feelings of frustration, sadness, or anger can accompany chronic pain, making it a multidimensional experience. Research is ongoing to better understand the mechanisms by which the brain processes pain and its subjective nature, as this may lead to more effective treatments and management strategies. Overall, pain is a vital biological signal, a warning that can range from mildly irritating to intensely debilitating, and it involves a complex interplay between sensory perception and emotional response.",411.0,1648.0,2111,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,5.648671627044678,3.089745283126831,9.926435708999634,Distressing,1.0
"Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat in the world, accounting for about 30% of total meat production worldwide compared to pork at 38%. Sixteen billion birds are raised annually for consumption, more than half of these in industrialised, factory-like production units. Global broiler meat production rose to 84.6 million tonnes in 2013. The largest producers were the United States (20%), China (16.6%), Brazil (15.1%) and the European Union (11.3%). There are two distinct models of production; the European Union supply chain model seeks to supply products which can be traced back to the farm of origin. This model faces the increasing costs of implementing additional food safety requirements, welfare issues and environmental regulations. In contrast, the United States model turns the product into a commodity.",What type of enviornment is poultry most commonly raised in?,"more than half of these in industrialised, factory-like production units",2,ENTY,"What type of enviornment is poultry most commonly raised in?

Relevant context: Poultry, which includes chickens, turkeys, ducks, and other birds raised for their meat and eggs, is most commonly raised in controlled agricultural environments designed to optimize productivity, health, and welfare. There are several primary methods of poultry farming, each varying in intensity, resource use, and environmental impact, with the two most common being conventional and free-range systems.

Conventional or industrial poultry farming is prevalent in many parts of the world, particularly in the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. In these systems, chickens are typically raised in large, enclosed barns or houses, which are equipped with climate control systems to maintain a consistent temperature and humidity level year-round. These barns are usually windowless to minimize the risk of disease transmission from external sources and allow for better control of light exposure, which can influence the birds' growth rates and laying patterns.

The flooring in these houses is often covered with a bedding material such as wood shavings or rice hulls, which helps to absorb moisture and control ammonia levels. Feed and water systems in these operations are automated, ensuring that the birds have continual access to nutrition. This controlled environment allows for efficient production and harvesting, with some operations housing tens of thousands of birds at a time.

In contrast, free-range or pasture-raised systems offer poultry more access to the outdoors and generally provide birds with a more natural environment. In such systems, birds have the opportunity to roam in fenced outdoor areas during daylight hours, allowing them to engage in natural behaviors like foraging and dust bathing, which can enhance their welfare. Although free-range systems may have lower bird densities than conventional systems, they can be more labor-intensive and typically yield poultry products that are perceived as higher quality by consumers, albeit often at higher prices.

Environmental conditions such as geographic location, climate, and availability of resources play significant roles in determining which type of environment is used for raising poultry. For example, in warmer climates, open-sided houses that take advantage of natural ventilation may be employed instead of fully enclosed facilities. With growing consumer demand for sustainably produced and welfare-oriented products, alternative poultry production systems, such as organic farming, are also increasing, often requiring compliance with specific standards regarding animal welfare and environmental impact.

In summary, while conventional intensive poultry systems dominate the industry due to their efficiency and cost-effectiveness, alternative methods that provide more natural living conditions for birds are gaining popularity. The choice of environment largely depends on a balance between economic factors, consumer demand, animal welfare considerations, and sustainability goals.",516.0,2011.0,2586,1.0,0.16666666666666666,0.3562071871080222,6.180203199386597,15.358321189880371,22.5500648021698,Intensive systems,0.0

Relevant context: The term commonly used to describe economists who subscribe to the Keynes school of thought is ""Keynesian economists."" This term is derived from the influential British economist John Maynard Keynes, whose groundbreaking work during the 1930s laid the foundation for this school of economic thought. Keynesian economics primarily emphasizes the role that government intervention can play in stabilizing the economy, especially during recessions.

Keynes' most pivotal contribution was his 1936 book, ""The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money,"" which challenged the classical economic notion that free markets would automatically ensure full employment. Instead, Keynes argued that in times of economic downturns, aggregate demand—comprising consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports—could fall short, causing persistent unemployment and stagnation. To counteract this, Keynesian economists advocate for active fiscal policy, including government spending and tax adjustments, to stimulate demand and, consequently, economic activity.

Keynesian economics gained prominence after World War II and significantly influenced economic policies throughout the mid-20th century, especially during periods of recession or economic instability. During these times, Keynesian economists typically support measures such as increased government spending on public works and infrastructure projects, as well as monetary policies that lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and investment.

While Keynesianism saw a decline in influence with the rise of monetarism and free-market policies in the late 20th century, it experienced a resurgence following the global financial crisis of 2008. In light of these events, many policymakers and economists, who identify as Keynesians, argued for large-scale stimulus packages to reinvigorate struggling economies.

Relevant context: In 2021, Dr. Caroline Mitchell, the newly appointed Secretary of Education, launched a comprehensive initiative aimed at bolstering partnerships between local universities and public school districts. Her primary aim was to create more opportunities for students across the state's public education systems. Dr. Mitchell, recognizing the challenges faced by public schools—ranging from funding shortages to limited educational resources—encouraged universities to leverage their vast resources and expertise to offer support.

Under Dr. Mitchell's leadership, the initiative proposed several key strategies. She advocated for universities to establish mentorship programs where university students and faculty could work directly with public school students and educators. Additionally, she emphasized the importance of developing dual-enrollment programs, allowing high school students to take college-level courses and earn credits before graduating. This not only provided academic advancement for high-achieving students but also aimed to inspire those from underserved communities by exposing them to higher education environments.

Her efforts were accompanied by a task force that included representatives from major universities, public school districts, and community organizations. In her speeches and public statements, Dr. Mitchell articulated a vision for a ""seamless educational pathway"" that would transform local communities through education. She often cited research showing that early exposure to collegiate environments and resources significantly increased the likelihood of public school students pursuing higher education.

By actively fostering dialogue and collaboration between universities and public schools, Dr. Mitchell's initiative has led to a marked increase in internships, workshops, and extracurricular opportunities tailored to public school students. This initiative has been hailed as a model for educational reform, with several states considering similar programs based on its success.

"After the war, Feynman declined an offer from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, despite the presence there of such distinguished faculty members as Albert Einstein, Kurt Gödel and John von Neumann. Feynman followed Hans Bethe, instead, to Cornell University, where Feynman taught theoretical physics from 1945 to 1950. During a temporary depression following the destruction of Hiroshima by the bomb produced by the Manhattan Project, he focused on complex physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction. One of these was analyzing the physics of a twirling, nutating dish as it is moving through the air. His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, proved important to his Nobel Prize–winning work, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities.",At which college did Feyman turn down a job?,Institute for Advanced Study,2,HUM,"At which college did Feyman turn down a job?

Relevant context: Certainly! Here is a detailed and informative passage:

Richard Feynman, a renowned physicist known for his work in quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics, famously turned down a job offer from the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). This decision took place after World War II, specifically in 1945, when many institutions were seeking to hire prominent scientists returning from wartime research projects. Despite MIT's prestigious reputation and excellent facilities, Feynman was seeking an environment where he could explore his unconventional ideas and approach to physics more freely.

At the time, Feynman was considering various opportunities, and he ultimately decided to join the faculty at Cornell University instead. He was drawn to Cornell due to the academic freedom it promised, as well as the opportunity to work alongside fellow physicists he respected. Cornell provided Feynman with the creative liberty he craved, enabling him to further develop his groundbreaking work that would later earn him a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965.

Feynman's decision to decline the offer from MIT is often cited as a reflection of his desire to prioritize intellectual exploration over prestige.

"Medicine, which was dominated by the Hippocratic tradition, saw new advances under Praxagoras of Kos, who theorized that blood traveled through the veins. Herophilos (335–280 BC) was the first to base his conclusions on dissection of the human body, animal vivisection and to provide accurate descriptions of the nervous system, liver and other key organs. Inﬂuenced by Philinus of Cos (ﬂ. 250), a student of Herophilos, a new medical sect emerged, the Empiric school, which was based on strict observation and rejected unseen causes of the Dogmatic school.",Who was the first to provide accurate descriptions of the nervous system?,Herophilos,2,HUM,"Who was the first to provide accurate descriptions of the nervous system?

Relevant context: The intricate workings of the nervous system have fascinated humans for centuries, but it was Galen of Pergamon, a prominent Greek physician in the Roman Empire, who first provided accurate descriptions that laid the foundation for our modern understanding. Living from approximately 129 to 216 CE, Galen was a prolific writer and one of the first to systematically organize and record medical knowledge. His descriptions of the nervous system were based on meticulous dissections and experiments on animals, primarily pigs and primates, since dissections of human corpses were culturally and legally prohibited.

Galen identified the brain as the central organ for sensation and voluntary action, challenging the previously held belief that the heart was the seat of the mind. His recognition of the brain’s function in controlling bodily processes marked a pivotal shift in medical thought. In his studies, Galen distinguished between different types of nerves, classifying them as sensory (carrying information to the brain) and motor (transmitting signals from the brain to muscles), a crucial understanding that prevails in neuroanatomy today.

One of Galen’s significant contributions was his documentation of cranial nerves. He described several of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves that are now known to emerge directly from the brain, influencing modern neurological and anatomical nomenclature. Additionally, he observed the autonomic nervous system, noting its role in regulating involuntary bodily functions.

Galen’s writings, especially his treatise ""On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body,"" integrated knowledge from earlier physicians like Hippocrates and Aristotle, while also presenting his original insights. This synthesis and innovation solidified his role as a pivotal figure in the history of neuroscience. Although future discoveries would refine and correct aspects of his work, the accuracy and depth of Galen’s descriptions of the nervous system provided a critical foundation for subsequent exploration and understanding for many centuries. His influence persisted through the Middle Ages, with his texts being a staple of medical education well into the Renaissance.",409.0,1691.0,2159,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,4.5323944091796875,1.2723393440246582,6.951382398605347,Herophilos,1.0
"On January 6, 2016, the league took over ""ownership and operational control"" of the Portland Thunder from its previous owners. The AFL stated this move was made after months of trying work out an arrangement ""to provide financial and operational support."" On February 3, 2016, it was announced that the franchise will start from scratch and no longer be called the ""Thunder"" as the name and trademarks belong to former franchise owner Terry Emmert (similar to the Jerry Jones move with the Desperados). AFL commissioner Scott Butera announced that a new identity will be announced at a later date.",Who owned the trademark to the Portland Thunder?,Terry Emmert,2,HUM,"Who owned the trademark to the Portland Thunder?

Relevant context: The Portland Thunder was an Arena Football League (AFL) team that was based in Portland, Oregon. The team entered the league as an expansion team in 2014. The trademark for the Portland Thunder was initially owned by the Arena Football League itself, which commonly retains trademark ownership of team names and logos as part of its business model to ensure consistent branding and oversight.

This arrangement allows the league to freely manage its teams' brand identities and facilitate any potential future changes in ownership or rebranding. The AFL registered the trademark shortly before the team's debut, ensuring legal protection over the team's name and associated merchandise. 

After two seasons, in early 2016, the ownership group of the Portland Thunder, led by Terry Emmert, sought control and opted to rebrand the team. This decision was influenced by strategic business moves to refine the team’s market appeal and to disengage from the prior legal and contractual ties held by the AFL. As a result, the checkered legal atmosphere surrounding the trademark eventually led to a rebranding. The franchise was renamed the Portland Steel for the 2016 season.

Ultimately, the AFL remained in control of the Portland Thunder trademark, while Emmert's group transitioned to their new branding under the Portland Steel name.

"At the same conference, Marshall Sahlins presented a paper entitled, ""Notes on the Original Affluent Society"", in which he challenged the popular view of hunter-gatherers lives as ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short,"" as Thomas Hobbes had put it in 1651. According to Sahlins, ethnographic data indicated that hunter-gatherers worked far fewer hours and enjoyed more leisure than typical members of industrial society, and they still ate well. Their ""affluence"" came from the idea that they were satisfied with very little in the material sense. Later, in 1996, Ross Sackett performed two distinct meta-analyses to empirically test Sahlin's view. The first of these studies looked at 102 time-allocation studies, and the second one analyzed 207 energy-expenditure studies. Sackett found that adults in foraging and horticultural societies work, on average, about 6.5 hours a day, where as people in agricultural and industrial societies work on average 8.8 hours a day.",Who called hunter-gathers the original affluent society?,Marshall Sahlins,2,HUM,"Who called hunter-gathers the original affluent society?

Relevant context: In 1972, the renowned anthropologist Marshall Sahlins delivered a groundbreaking lecture at a symposium regarding the state of research on hunter-gatherer societies. This lecture, and the subsequent publication titled ""The Original Affluent Society,"" challenged prevailing perceptions about the economic status of hunter-gatherers. Contrary to the widely held belief at the time that such societies lived on the brink of subsistence, Sahlins argued that hunter-gatherers were, in fact, affluent and prosperous.

Sahlins's argument was based on research indicating that hunter-gatherer societies often met their material needs with minimal effort, working far fewer hours than their agricultural or industrial counterparts. He suggested that they achieved affluence not through the accumulation of goods, but through the abundance of their natural environment, their efficient use of resources, and their non-materialistic values. Their limited material needs were easily satisfied, allowing them leisure time and a balanced lifestyle that many modern societies strive to achieve.

This bold characterization of hunter-gatherers as the ""original affluent society"" spurred a re-evaluation of economic development narratives and influenced subsequent anthropological and sociological research.

"Rheinmetall in Germany developed an automatic 20 mm in the 1920s and Oerlikon in Switzerland had acquired the patent to an automatic 20 mm gun designed in Germany during World War I. Germany introduced the rapid-fire 2 cm FlaK 30 and later in the decade it was redesigned by Mauser-Werke and became the 2 cm FlaK 38. Nevertheless, while 20 mm was better than a machine gun and mounted on a very small trailer made it easy to move, its effectiveness was limited. Germany therefore added a 3.7 cm. The first, the 3.7 cm FlaK 18 developed by Rheinmetall in the early 1930s, was basically an enlarged 2 cm FlaK 30. It was introduced in 1935 and production stopped the following year. A redesigned gun 3.7 cm FlaK 36 entered service in 1938, it too had a two-wheel carriage. However, by the mid-1930s the Luftwaffe realised that there was still a coverage gap between 3.7 cm and 8.8 cm guns. They started development of a 5 cm gun on a four-wheel carriage.",Which company redesigned the rapid fire 2 cm FlaK 30?,Mauser-Werke,2,HUM,"Which company redesigned the rapid fire 2 cm FlaK 30?

Relevant context: The 2 cm FlaK 30, originally developed by Rheinmetall in the 1930s, was a widely used anti-aircraft gun by Germany during the early stages of World War II. Initially, this firearm was regarded as an efficient solution for targeting low-flying aircraft. However, as the war progressed, the limitations of the FlaK 30 began to surface, particularly its relatively low rate of fire compared to newer anti-aircraft models.

In response to these performance concerns, Mauser, a prominent firearms manufacturer in Germany, undertook a project to redesign the FlaK 30 to improve its effectiveness. This redesign led to the development of the 2 cm FlaK 38, which featured several critical improvements that addressed the shortcomings of its predecessor. The most notable enhancement was the increased rate of fire, jumping from approximately 240 rounds per minute to about 400 rounds per minute. This was achieved through modifications in the feed mechanism and other internal components, allowing the FlaK 38 to better engage faster-moving targets.

Besides the increased rate of fire, the FlaK 38 also benefitted from a slightly reduced overall weight, making it more maneuverable in various combat situations. These improvements resulted in the FlaK 38 becoming the standard light anti-aircraft gun for the German military, widely employed across the European theaters until the end of the war.

Mauser's successful modifications exemplified their ongoing innovation in firearms technology during this era. The 2 cm FlaK 38 thus stood as a testament to the enhancements that could be made through careful engineering, allowing it to meet the evolving demands of aerial warfare.",344.0,1624.0,2030,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.6104114055633545,1.4409575462341309,9.240439414978027,Mauser-Werke,1.0
"Increasing state control over the oil sector, the RCC began a program of nationalization, starting with the expropriation of British Petroleum's share of the British Petroleum-N.B. Hunt Sahir Field in December 1971. In September 1973, it was announced that all foreign oil producers active in Libya were to be nationalized. For Gaddafi, this was an important step towards socialism. It proved an economic success; while gross domestic product had been $3.8 billion in 1969, it had risen to $13.7 billion in 1974, and $24.5 billion in 1979. In turn, the Libyans' standard of life greatly improved over the first decade of Gaddafi's administration, and by 1979 the average per-capita income was at $8,170, up from $40 in 1951; this was above the average of many industrialized countries like Italy and the U.K.",What company's property did Libya nationalize in December of 1971?,British Petroleum,2,HUM,"What company's property did Libya nationalize in December of 1971?

Relevant context: In December of 1971, the Libyan government under the leadership of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi took a significant step in asserting control over foreign economic interests by nationalizing the property of British Petroleum (BP). This action was part of a broader strategy to increase Libya's control over its oil resources and assert its economic sovereignty following the 1969 coup that brought Gaddafi to power.

The nationalization of BP’s assets in Libya was prompted by a combination of political and economic factors, including the Libyan government's desire to increase its share of oil revenues and reduce foreign influence in its oil industry, which was a critical component of the country's economy. BP, at that time, was one of the major international oil companies operating in Libya, alongside other giants like Exxon, Mobil, and Royal Dutch Shell.

This move by Libya was part of a larger trend during the 1970s where resource-rich countries, especially those in the Middle East and North Africa, sought to gain greater control and ownership over their natural resources, leading to changes in how oil production and revenues were managed globally. The nationalization not only significantly impacted BP, leading to the loss of a lucrative operation, but also contributed to the shifting dynamics of the global oil market, as countries like Libya pursued more independently-controlled oil sectors.

The aftermath of the nationalization had wider implications for international relations and economic policies, particularly as countries grappled with balancing national interests with foreign investments and partnerships. BP had to recalibrate its global operations in response to losing its Libyan assets, illustrating the risks inherent in investing in geopolitically volatile regions.

Libya's decision to nationalize BP's properties was a clear demonstration of Gaddafi's broader political and economic strategies and is remembered as a pivotal moment in the history of the global oil industry.",378.0,2032.0,2469,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.176082611083984,1.8799989223480225,9.687852144241333,British Petroleum,1.0
"The 2004 election was the first to be affected by the campaign finance reforms mandated by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (also known as the McCain–Feingold Bill for its sponsors in the United States Senate). Because of the Act's restrictions on candidates' and parties' fundraising, a large number of so-called 527 groups emerged. Named for a section of the Internal Revenue Code, these groups were able to raise large amounts of money for various political causes as long as they do not coordinate their activities with political campaigns. Examples of 527s include Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, MoveOn.org, the Media Fund, and America Coming Together. Many such groups were active throughout the campaign season.

Relevant context: The stipulation that enabled 527 groups to campaign for funds lies in a specific section of the United States tax code. Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code governs the activities of these organizations. Unlike traditional political action committees (PACs), 527 groups are tax-exempt organizations created primarily to influence the selection, nomination, election, appointment, or defeat of candidates to federal, state, or local public office.

A critical factor stems from the 527 status under the IRS, which allows these groups to raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals, corporations, or unions without the same constraints that apply to PACs. This stipulation came into sharp focus following the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, also known as the McCain-Feingold Act, which redefined certain campaign finance rules, notably prohibiting national political party committees from raising or spending any funds not subject to federal limits (i.e., soft money).

However, 527 groups are not bound by the Federal Election Campaign Act's disclosure requirements, provided they do not coordinate directly with a candidate or explicitly advocate for the election or defeat of a specific candidate. Instead, they engage in ""issue advocacy,"" focusing on particular policies or issues without directly stating which candidate voters should support or oppose. This loophole allows them to campaign vigorously for funds without being restricted by the stringent regulations imposed on direct political contributions.

To maintain their tax-exempt status, 527 groups must register with the IRS and disclose their contributions and expenditures, but these disclosures are not as stringent or timely as those required by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for other political committees. This legal framework enables 527 groups to amass significant financial resources for political activities, particularly during election cycles, making them influential players in American politics through their ability to fund widespread advertising and mobilization efforts. 

Thus, the key stipulation enabling these groups to campaign for funds is their classification under Section 527, allowing them extensive latitude in fundraising and spending, as long as they abstain from directly coordinating with candidates or political parties on election-focused strategies.",432.0,1970.0,2463,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.657145738601685,1.3071041107177734,7.073121786117554,No coordination with political campaigns,0.8
"A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology. Within all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles. It is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment and unemployment, as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another.",What transitions occur during puberty in addition to living circumstances?,"education, training, employment and unemployment",2,HUM,"What transitions occur during puberty in addition to living circumstances?

Relevant context: During puberty, young individuals experience a wide spectrum of transitions that extend beyond just biological changes. Puberty marks a critical period of growth and development that encompasses physical, emotional, social, and cognitive transformations, often accompanied by shifts in living circumstances.

Physically, puberty is characterized by a series of changes driven by hormonal fluctuations. For girls, this typically includes the onset of menstruation, development of breasts, and the growth of pubic and underarm hair. For boys, it often involves the enlargement of the testicles and penis, deepening of the voice, and the appearance of facial, pubic, and body hair. Both genders experience growth spurts in height and weight and increased acne due to sebaceous gland activity.

Emotionally, puberty can bring about heightened sensitivity and mood swings, which are largely attributed to the surge of hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Adolescents may develop a stronger sense of identity and become more conscious of their self-image, leading to occasional conflicts with self-esteem or body image.

Socially, the transition during puberty includes an evolving shift in relationships. Adolescents often seek more independence from their families and start to prioritize peer relationships. This can lead to the exploration of romantic relationships and a greater interest in social activities. Navigating social circles can sometimes result in peer pressure and the desire to conform, which can further impact an adolescent's decision-making and values.

Cognitively, puberty stimulates advancements in thought processes. There is a movement towards abstract and complex thinking, allowing adolescents to better understand perspectives, scenarios, and hypothetical situations. This cognitive maturation is a crucial step in preparing for adult responsibilities and decision-making.

In terms of living circumstances, puberty is frequently a time when children transition from elementary to secondary education settings, which may introduce new academic challenges and social dynamics. Some adolescents might also experience changes in family structures, such as parental separation, remarriage, or the introduction of new siblings. These shifts can amplify the instability or uncertainty felt during this developmental stage.

In some scenarios, adolescents might face transitions in their living environments, such as moving to a new home or locale due to parental job changes, which can necessitate adjustments to new schools, neighborhoods, and social circles.

Overall, puberty is a complex period replete with multiple interconnected transitions that are not just limited to the biological aspect but are also deeply intertwined with emotional, social, cognitive, and environmental changes. Understanding these varied dimensions can help provide better support for adolescents as they navigate this formative life stage.",516.0,1719.0,2294,1.0,0.25,0.43067655807339306,5.88044285774231,1.9993138313293457,9.921239852905273,"Education, training, employment",0.7

Relevant context: In 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), an independent non-partisan agency within the U.S. Congress, conducted a detailed investigation into reports concerning the presence of hazardous chemicals in everyday consumer products. Among the various issues they explored, the GAO released a report highlighting the discovery of high levels of formaldehyde in non-wrinkle clothing. This substance, which is often used in fabric treatment to confer wrinkle resistance, was found in concentrations that raised health and safety concerns.

As part of their investigation, the GAO examined garments supplied by numerous retailers and manufacturers. They conducted their testing in accordance with international safety standards, which dictate permissible formaldehyde levels in textiles. The findings indicated that a significant number of the non-wrinkle clothing items exceeded these recommended limits. The report underscored potential health risks associated with prolonged exposure to formaldehyde, which can include skin irritation and allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. 

In response to the findings, the GAO recommended stricter regulatory oversight and called for enhanced labeling to inform consumers about the chemical treatments used in their clothing. They also suggested that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) review and potentially update its safety guidelines to address these chemical exposure risks.

"Building on the earlier work of Ludwig von Mises and others, Hayek also argued that while in centrally planned economies an individual or a select group of individuals must determine the distribution of resources, these planners will never have enough information to carry out this allocation reliably. This argument, first proposed by Max Weber, says that the efficient exchange and use of resources can be maintained only through the price mechanism in free markets (see economic calculation problem).",Whose work most notably influenced Hayek's argument regarding resource distribution?,Max Weber,2,HUM,"Whose work most notably influenced Hayek's argument regarding resource distribution?

Relevant context: Friedrich Hayek, a prominent economist renowned for his contribution to the understanding of market economies, was significantly influenced by several intellectual figures in crafting his arguments regarding resource distribution. Among these, the work of Ludwig von Mises stands out as particularly influential. Mises, an Austrian economist, was a leading figure in the Austrian School of economic thought, and his insights into price mechanisms and market processes deeply informed Hayek’s perspectives.

Hayek was particularly impacted by Mises’s seminal work, ""Socialism,"" published in 1922. In this book, Mises argued against the feasibility of central planning, positing that without market-determined prices, resource allocation would be inefficient and inevitably lead to economic chaos. This critique of socialism provided the foundation for Hayek's own argument about the impossibility of centralized control over complex economic systems.

Hayek expanded upon Mises’s ideas by emphasizing the role of knowledge in society. In his famous essay, ""The Use of Knowledge in Society"" (1945), Hayek argued that the price system functions as a communication mechanism, conveying information about the relative scarcity of resources across a dispersed network of individuals. This insight was deeply rooted in Mises's understanding of the indispensability of price signals in coordinating economic activity.

Moreover, Hayek’s idea that decentralized decision-making leads to a more efficient allocation of resources can be traced back to Mises’s early critiques of planned economies. Mises's assertion that knowledge is too fragmented and individualistic to be effectively centralized underpins Hayek’s emphasis on the limits of human rationality and the superiority of spontaneous ordering processes through the market.

Hayek’s work not only reflects Mises’s theoretical foundations but also extends them, integrating them with a broader philosophical perspective on liberty and individualism. Mises’s influence on Hayek was instrumental in shaping his belief that the price system is not just a mechanism for economic calculation, but also a precondition for the preservation of freedom in a society. Thus, it is Ludwig von Mises's work that most notably influenced Hayek's arguments regarding resource distribution.",431.0,1682.0,2176,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.328818321228027,1.0874223709106445,10.381230115890503,Ludwig von Mises,0.0
"In 2014 attention was drawn to an appeal to the New Zealand Immigration and Protection Tribunal against the deportation of a Tuvaluan family on the basis that they were ""climate change refugees"", who would suffer hardship resulting from the environmental degradation of Tuvalu. However the subsequent grant of residence permits to the family was made on grounds unrelated to the refugee claim. The family was successful in their appeal because, under the relevant immigration legislation, there were ""exceptional circumstances of a humanitarian nature"" that justified the grant of resident permits as the family was integrated into New Zealand society with a sizeable extended family which had effectively relocated to New Zealand. Indeed, in 2013 a claim of a Kiribati man of being a ""climate change refugee"" under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) was determined by the New Zealand High Court to be untenable as there was no persecution or serious harm related to any of the five stipulated Refugee Convention grounds. Permanent migration to Australia and New Zealand, such as for family reunification, requires compliance with the immigration legislation of those countries.",What court ruled the claim of climate change refugee to be untenable?,New Zealand High Court,2,HUM,"What court ruled the claim of climate change refugee to be untenable?

Relevant context: In a landmark decision, the New Zealand Court of Appeal ruled against the concept of a ""climate change refugee"" in 2014. The case involved Ioane Teitiota, a man from Kiribati, who sought asylum in New Zealand on the grounds that rising sea levels and the effects of climate change were rendering his home country increasingly uninhabitable. Teitiota argued that these environmental changes threatened his livelihood and safety, effectively making him a refugee fleeing from climate change-induced conditions.

However, the court found that the definition of ""refugee"" under international law did not encompass those subjected to environmental changes. The ruling emphasized that existing frameworks, such as the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, pertain specifically to individuals facing persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. The Court of Appeal concluded that while climate change represents a serious global challenge, its impacts do not meet the criteria necessary to qualify individuals as refugees under the current legal definitions.

This decision was subsequently upheld by New Zealand's Supreme Court when Teitiota appealed, reinforcing the notion that the need to develop international law to address climate-induced displacement is urgent, but such recognition had yet to be formalized at the time of the ruling.

Relevant context: In a compelling analysis published by The Independent, literary critic John Marshall delved into the complexities of Gerard Manley Hopkins' poetry, offering a nuanced critique that stirred considerable discussion among enthusiasts and scholars alike. The article, appearing in the June 2017 edition of the newspaper, focused on several key aspects of Hopkins' work, including his innovative use of sprung rhythm and the intense religious themes that permeate his poetry. 

Marshall's critique was particularly noted for its balanced perspective, acknowledging Hopkins as a transformative figure in Victorian poetry while also questioning whether his dense style and sometimes obscure language hindered his accessibility to a broader audience. The critic praised Hopkins for his vivid imagery and emotional depth, yet he argued that the poet's writings often required extensive interpretation, which could alienate casual readers.

Marshall drew attention to Hopkins' famous poem ""The Windhover,"" using it as an example of the poet's mastery of sound and rhythm. However, he also pointed out that its intricate structure might detract from its enjoyment without a deeper understanding of its themes and linguistic devices. The article effectively sparked debate by neither wholly glorifying nor dismissing Hopkins, but rather inviting readers to engage with his work through a critical lens.

"The British recognised the need for anti-aircraft capability a few weeks before World War I broke out; on 8 July 1914, the New York Times reported that the British government had decided to 'dot the coasts of the British Isles with a series of towers, each armed with two quick-firing guns of special design,' while 'a complete circle of towers' was to be built around 'naval installations' and 'at other especially vulnerable points.' By December 1914 the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) was manning AA guns and searchlights assembled from various sources at some nine ports. The Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) was given responsibility for AA defence in the field, using motorised two-gun sections. The first were formally formed in November 1914. Initially they used QF 1-pounder ""pom-pom"" (a 37 mm version of the Maxim Gun).",Who used motorised two-gun sections?,Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA),2,HUM,"Who used motorised two-gun sections?

Relevant context: In the context of military history, the concept of ""motorised two-gun sections"" is closely associated with the British Army during the Second World War. These units were typically part of the Royal Artillery regiments, which utilized motorized transport to rapidly deploy artillery pieces to strategic locations. This allowed for more flexible and mobile operations, especially as warfare became more mechanized and relied heavily on speed and quick repositioning.

Each motorised two-gun section usually included two anti-tank or field artillery guns, along with their crews and necessary support vehicles. The vehicles used for transport varied but often included trucks or light armored vehicles capable of towing the guns and carrying ammunition and equipment. This setup proved particularly effective in North African and European theaters, where the need for quick response to shifting battlefield conditions was crucial.

The British Army adopted the motorised artillery approach to strengthen its anti-tank and anti-personnel capabilities, which were critical in countering the heavily armored divisions of the German Wehrmacht. As the war progressed, these motorised units became key components in both offensive operations, such as the advance through Western Europe following the D-Day invasion, and defensive operations, such as protecting supply lines and supporting infantry units.

Motorisation of artillery sections was an evolution from the older, horse-drawn artillery methods, allowing armies to keep pace with advances in tank design and motorized infantry tactics. The mobility provided by motorized support enabled the artillery to operate closer to the front lines and provide direct support to advancing or retreating ground forces.

Overall, the use of motorised two-gun sections exemplifies the broader trend of mechanization in military tactics during World War II, highlighting the importance of mobility and speed in modern warfare.",355.0,1667.0,2076,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.749341011047363,0.9305112361907959,6.857467412948608,Napoleon,0.0

Pub landlords had raised concerns prior to the implementation of the law that a smoking ban would have a negative impact on sales. After two years, the impact of the ban was mixed; some pubs suffered declining sales, while others developed their food sales. The Wetherspoon pub chain reported in June 2009 that profits were at the top end of expectations; however, Scottish & Newcastle's takeover by Carlsberg and Heineken was reported in January 2008 as partly the result of its weakness following falling sales due to the ban. Similar bans are applied in Australian pubs with smoking only allowed in designated areas.",What company took over Scottish & Newcastle's pubs?,Carlsberg and Heineken,2,HUM,"What company took over Scottish & Newcastle's pubs?

Relevant context: In January 2008, Scottish & Newcastle, a prominent brewery and pub operator in the United Kingdom, became the focus of a major acquisition. Its pub business was eventually taken over by a consortium formed by two leading European brewing companies: Heineken, based in the Netherlands, and Carlsberg, from Denmark. These companies formalized the acquisition through a successful joint bid valued at approximately £7.8 billion.

The strategic move was part of a broader trend of consolidation within the brewing industry, allowing Heineken and Carlsberg to expand their market share and distribution presence in Europe. Specifically, Heineken acquired the UK assets of Scottish & Newcastle, which included its extensive pub estate. This acquisition enabled Heineken to solidify its foothold in the UK market by gaining control over key regional brands and an expansive network of pubs and bars.

Scottish & Newcastle's impressive portfolio featured iconic brands and a wide array of pubs scattered across the United Kingdom. By purchasing this substantial portion of Scottish & Newcastle's operations, Heineken positioned itself to leverage these assets for growth and to enhance its competitive edge within the highly saturated UK beer market.

Carlsberg, on the other hand, took control of other parts of Scottish & Newcastle's international operations, particularly focusing on developing its brand presence in regions where it sought to strengthen its position.

The acquisition had significant impacts on the strategic directions of both Heineken and Carlsberg, as well as on the landscape of the brewing industry in the UK and Europe as a whole.

Relevant context: In response to the query about which government agency identifies General Electric (GE) as a leading producer of Superfund toxic waste sites, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the pertinent agency. The EPA is responsible for administering the Superfund program, which was established by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980. This program was designed to identify and clean up sites contaminated with hazardous substances.

General Electric has been recognized by the EPA as a significant contributor to toxic waste sites that fall under the Superfund designation. Over the years, GE has been linked to a number of polluted locations across the United States, such as the Hudson River PCB contamination case. In this instance, the EPA documented that GE discharged large quantities of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into the Hudson River over several decades. This contamination led to the site being listed as a Superfund site, requiring extensive cleanup and remediation efforts.

The EPA compiles and maintains a National Priorities List (NPL), which identifies sites that present significant risk to human health or the environment, and where remedial action is needed. Sites associated with GE often appear on this list, highlighting the company's historical role in environmental pollution and the resultant cleanup efforts that are necessary to mitigate these impacts.

For those researching environmental accountability and corporate responsibility, the EPA’s Superfund records provide detailed information on companies, like GE, involved in these critical environmental issues.

Relevant context: The establishment of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and its supremacy in legal matters was primarily achieved through the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. This landmark piece of legislation was a significant step in the modernization and separation of powers within the UK's constitutional framework.

Prior to the Constitutional Reform Act, the judicial functions of the highest court in the United Kingdom were carried out by the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords. However, to enhance the separation between the legislative and judicial branches, the Act led to the creation of the Supreme Court of the UK, which officially came into existence on October 1, 2009.

The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 was pivotal in establishing the supremacy of the Supreme Court by providing it with a clear mandate to act as the highest tribunal in constitutional and public law matters within the UK, thereby separating it from Parliament. The Act defines the composition, jurisdiction, and powers of the Supreme Court, ensuring its independence from both Parliament and the Government.

Moreover, the Act introduced changes to the positions of the Lord Chancellor and the judiciary to reinforce judicial independence and streamline the judicial appointment process. By removing the judicial role from the House of Lords and creating a distinct, independent Supreme Court, the Constitutional Reform Act effectively fortified the rule of law and judicial review, empowering the court to adjudicate on issues of significant constitutional importance.

The Supreme Court's supremacy is thus enshrined in its ability to interpret and uphold the constitutionality of legislation and government actions within the union of the United Kingdom's devolved and national legal systems, making it a cornerstone of British constitutional law.

Relevant context: In a recent development, the Iranian Parliament has enacted legislation allowing the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Trade to exploit mines without requiring guidance or oversight from the Department of the Environment. This decision marks a significant shift in the regulatory framework governing mining activities in Iran. Previously, collaborative oversight between these two departments was mandatory to ensure that environmental protection standards were maintained alongside industrial expansion.

Proponents of the new legislation argue that it streamlines the process of mineral extraction, potentially boosting economic growth by accelerating project timelines and reducing bureaucratic red tape. This could attract foreign investment and enhance Iran's position in the global minerals market. The country is rich in natural resources, including copper, iron ore, and rare earth elements, all of which are critical to various industries worldwide.

However, environmental advocates and some government officials have expressed concerns about the potential ecological impact of such deregulated mining activities. They warn that without the Department of the Environment's input, there is a heightened risk of environmental degradation, including biodiversity loss, water pollution, and deforestation. These could have long-term consequences for Iran's agriculture, wildlife, and public health.

The legislation reflects a broader governmental strategy to prioritize economic development and job creation in sectors such as mining and construction. It has initiated a nationwide debate on balancing economic interests with environmental responsibilities, a challenge faced by many resource-rich nations. Critics suggest that alternative approaches, like enhanced regulatory compliance frameworks or sustainable mining practices, might ensure responsible resource management while still fostering economic growth.

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Lodge might adjourn for a formal dinner, or festive board, sometimes involving toasting and song.",Name examples of usual formal business that Freemasons have at their lodge.,"pay bills, organise social and charitable events, elect new members",2,HUM,"Name examples of usual formal business that Freemasons have at their lodge.

Relevant context: When Freemasons gather at their lodges for formal business meetings, they typically engage in a structured set of activities. These meetings are often referred to as ""stated communications"" and occur regularly, usually monthly or quarterly, depending on the particular lodge's schedule and traditions.

One of the primary purposes of these meetings is the conduct of administrative business. This includes the reading and approval of minutes from the previous meetings, which is a formal record of discussions and decisions made. Financial reports are also a key component, where the treasurer presents updates on the lodge's finances, including income, expenses, and any donations or charity work that the lodge has been involved in. 

Another important aspect of these meetings is the discussion of membership matters. This might involve balloting on new petitions for membership, where existing members vote on potential new members after a period of investigation and background checks. It could also include discussions of progress for current members who are candidates advancing through the various degrees of Masonry. 

Lodges also tend to review and plan Masonic events and activities, such as charitable initiatives and community service projects, which are central to the organization's mission. In addition, there's usually a segment dedicated to education and training, where members engage in Masonic lectures or lessons to deepen their understanding of the fraternity's history, philosophy, and symbolism.

Finally, business meetings often conclude with announcements of upcoming events, important communications from the grand lodge (which oversees the individual lodges), and feedback from members. All these activities are conducted under a formal order of business that reflects the traditional and ritualistic nature of the organization, reinforcing the values of brotherhood, integrity, and community service. 

Overall, the formal business of a Masonic lodge is multi-faceted, involving administrative tasks, educational initiatives, and planning of charitable work, all conducted with a commitment to tradition and the organization's core values.",394.0,1453.0,1913,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.598751068115234,0.9756665229797363,8.676272869110107,"Pay bills, organize events, elect members",0.8
"There is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in Trinidad and Tobago. Hunting is carried out with firearms, and aided by the use of hounds, with the illegal use of trap guns, trap cages and snare nets. With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable. In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months - October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high. Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species (red-rumped agouti, lowland paca, nine-banded armadillo, collared peccary, and red brocket deer) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013). It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting. Various herons, ducks, doves, the green iguana, the gold tegu, the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys, southern tamanduas, Brazilian porcupines, yellow-footed tortoises, Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds, the scarlet ibis. Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training. There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded, and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, with hunting occurring both in and out of season, and even in wildlife sanctuaries. There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously, with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments, and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management.",What very active tradition Trinidad and Tabago have?,hunting of small to medium-sized wild game,2,HUM,"What very active tradition Trinidad and Tabago have?

Relevant context: Trinidad and Tobago is renowned for its vibrant and uniquely colorful tradition of Carnival, which is arguably the most active and well-known cultural celebration on the islands. Carnival in Trinidad and Tobago is a pre-Lenten festival that takes place annually, culminating on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday. It is celebrated with exuberant street parades, music, dancing, and elaborate costumes. 

The origins of Carnival in Trinidad and Tobago date back to the 18th century, influenced by the French settlers who brought over their traditions of masquerade balls and festivities. Over time, the celebration evolved to incorporate African, Indian, and Creole elements, making it a rich tapestry of the islands' diverse cultural heritage. One of the highlights is the ""Mas"" or masquerade, where participants don highly creative and intricately designed costumes, competing in various categories such as individual, group, and band presentations. 

Music plays a central role in the festival, with steelpan bands and calypso music creating the rhythmic backdrop for much of the celebration. Calypso was developed in Trinidad and Tobago and is characterized by its witty and often satirical lyrics. Soca music, a fusion of soul and calypso, is also a staple during Carnival, energizing the numerous fetes and street parties that occur throughout the season.

One of the key events of Carnival is ""J'ouvert,"" a pre-dawn event on Carnival Monday that involves revellers covering themselves in mud, paint, or chocolate while dancing through the streets. The vibrant Monday and Tuesday parades are marked by a sea of dancers and musicians making their way through Port of Spain, with the most significant competition being the ""Band of the Year.""

Carnival is more than just a festival; it is a significant cultural phenomenon that brings together communities and draws visitors from all over the world. The celebration is a testament to the islands' creativity, resilience, and dedication to preserving their cultural heritage. It is an expression of freedom, unity, and joy, reflecting the rich history and dynamic spirit of Trinidad and Tobago.",425.0,1663.0,2145,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.947221040725708,0.9863450527191162,5.895257472991943,Calypso music,0.0
"The first elevator shaft preceded the first elevator by four years. Construction for Peter Cooper's Cooper Union Foundation building in New York began in 1853. An elevator shaft was included in the design, because Cooper was confident that a safe passenger elevator would soon be invented. The shaft was cylindrical because Cooper thought it was the most efficient design. Later, Otis designed a special elevator for the building. Today the Otis Elevator Company, now a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation, is the world's largest manufacturer of vertical transport systems.",The Otis Elevator Company is today a subsidiary of what major corporation?,United Technologies Corporation,2,HUM,"The Otis Elevator Company is today a subsidiary of what major corporation?

Relevant context: The Otis Elevator Company, renowned for its pivotal role in the development of safe and reliable elevators, is today a wholly owned subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation (UTC). Since its founding in 1853 by Elisha Otis, the Otis Elevator Company has become a leader in its industry, contributing to the growth of skyscrapers and modern urban architecture worldwide. The company's innovations, including the safety elevator equipped with a special mechanism to prevent cars from falling in case of cable failure, have made it an integral part of any conversation regarding vertical transportation.

In 1976, United Technologies, a major American multinational conglomerate headquartered in Farmington, Connecticut, acquired Otis Elevator. UTC, known for its diverse operations in numerous aerospace and building systems markets, saw Otis as a strategic acquisition to complement and bolster its building solutions portfolio. Under United Technologies, Otis continued to thrive and expand its global presence, maintaining its reputation as a pioneering force in elevator technology.

In 2020, following United Technologies' merger with Raytheon Company to form Raytheon Technologies, a reshuffling of the company's structure led to Otis Elevator being spun off as an independent publicly-traded company. This move marked a new chapter for Otis, allowing it to focus solely on its core competencies in the manufacture, installation, and servicing of elevators, escalators, and moving walkways.

Therefore, while Otis was a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation for several decades, it now operates independently with its shares publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol OTIS.",330.0,1669.0,2059,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,4.174558877944946,1.0001368522644043,6.164047718048096,United Technologies Corporation,1.0
"In August 2007 Virgil Griffith, a Caltech computation and neural-systems graduate student, created a searchable database that linked changes made by anonymous Wikipedia editors to companies and organizations from which the changes were made. The database cross-referenced logs of Wikipedia edits with publicly available records pertaining to the internet IP addresses edits were made from. Griffith was motivated by the edits from the United States Congress, and wanted to see if others were similarly promoting themselves. The tool was designed to detect conflict of interest edits. Among his findings were that FBI computers were used to edit the FBI article in Wikipedia. Although the edits correlated with known FBI IP addresses, there was no proof that the changes actually came from a member or employee of the FBI, only that someone who had access to their network had edited the FBI article in Wikipedia. Wikipedia spokespersons received Griffith's ""WikiScanner"" positively, noting that it helped prevent conflicts of interest from influencing articles as well as increasing transparency and mitigating attempts to remove or distort relevant facts.",What part of the government was editing its own wikipedia page?,United States Congress,2,HUM,"What part of the government was editing its own wikipedia page?

Relevant context: In recent years, there have been several instances where it was reported that government agencies were editing their own Wikipedia pages, raising questions about transparency and the accuracy of publicly available information. One notable case emerged in 2014, when it was discovered that some edits to Wikipedia entries were traced back to IP addresses associated with the U.S. Congress. These edits included changes to biographical information of politicians, updates to legislative records, and sometimes controversial rewording of sensitive topics to present them in a more favorable light for certain individuals or policies.

The edits were not exclusive to the United States; similar activities have been observed in other countries. For example, in 2015, it was reported that the Russian government had altered Wikipedia pages related to the country's involvement in the Ukrainian conflict. These edits were made to align the narratives with those promoted by official channels, creating a potential bias in how historical events were recorded.

Such activities, which are often revealed through platforms like Twitter or automated monitoring tools such as the ""Congress-edits"" Twitter bot—which was set up to tweet every time Wikipedia edits were made from congressional IP addresses—highlight the ongoing challenge of ensuring that Wikipedia remains a neutral and accurate source of information. Although Wikipedia has systems in place to review and revert biased or inaccurate changes, the incidents bring attention to the responsibilities of public institutions in managing information dissemination and the importance of maintaining the integrity of publicly edited encyclopedias.

Relevant context: In the 2000 United States presidential election, Democratic candidate Al Gore, who was the sitting Vice President at the time, ran against Republican candidate George W. Bush, the Governor of Texas. Al Gore, a native of Tennessee, faced a unique and challenging situation during the election. Despite his strong national campaign and narrow popular vote lead nationwide, Gore lost the electoral votes from his home state of Tennessee. 

The loss of Tennessee was pivotal. A total of 11 electoral votes were at stake, and had Gore secured them, it might have altered the election's outcome. Losing one's own state is generally considered a significant political setback, particularly because candidates typically have strong regional support in their home states. 

Gore's defeat in Tennessee was attributed to several factors, including the state's conservative leanings and the perception that he had drifted away from his moderate roots to appeal to a broader national audience. Additionally, George W. Bush's campaign resonated with voters in Tennessee, partly due to his appeal to Southern values and his promises of tax cuts and education reform.

In the end, the 2000 election was one of the closest in American history, with the outcome ultimately decided by a contentious Supreme Court decision regarding a recount in Florida. Despite winning the popular vote nationwide, Gore conceded the presidency to Bush after the Court's ruling.

"The transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture is not necessarily a one way process. It has been argued that hunting and gathering represents an adaptive strategy, which may still be exploited, if necessary, when environmental change causes extreme food stress for agriculturalists. In fact, it is sometimes difficult to draw a clear line between agricultural and hunter-gatherer societies, especially since the widespread adoption of agriculture and resulting cultural diffusion that has occurred in the last 10,000 years.[citation needed] This anthropological view has remained unchanged since the 1960s.[clarification needed][citation needed]",What change from hunting and gathering to agriculture is not easy to mark?,transition,2,HUM,"What change from hunting and gathering to agriculture is not easy to mark?

Relevant context: The transition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one centered around agriculture is often depicted as a clear-cut and almost revolutionary shift in human history, commonly referred to as the Neolithic Revolution. However, in practice, this change was gradual and complex, making it difficult to mark a specific point at which societies definitively moved from hunting and gathering to farming. 

Historically, this transition did not happen uniformly around the world, and it involved a myriad of overlapping phases that confuse the neat categorization of societies as solely hunter-gatherers or agriculturalists. In some cases, a community might engage in both activities simultaneously or transition back and forth between them based on environmental conditions, resources availability, or social pressures. 

Moreover, the adoption of agriculture involved incremental steps rather than a single, transformative event. For example, as people began to plant gardens, they steadily increased their reliance on cultivated crops over generations, while simultaneously continuing to hunt and gather to complement their diet. Botanical evidence from archaeological sites often reflects this gradual increase in cultivated species alongside wild ones, indicating prolonged periods of mixed subsistence strategies.

Additionally, the factors driving communities to adopt agriculture varied widely, including climate changes that affected the availability of wild foods, demographic pressures that made farming more viable, and even cultural shifts that favored sedentary lifestyles. Furthermore, the technology and knowledge required for effective farming, such as domesticating plants and animals, were developed over long spans of trial and error rather than being immediately available to early humans.

Due to this complexity, scholars often find it hard to pinpoint exact timelines or distinct transitions within the archaeological record. Instead, they observe a mosaic of practices and innovations that collectively contributed to the eventual dominance of agriculture, but which resist a tidy chronological boundary. The nuanced nature of this shift makes it challenging to define neatly, illustrating how human societies adapt in multifaceted and context-dependent ways.",390.0,1208.0,1657,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,3.789839744567871,0.9994924068450928,5.873829364776611,Clear line,0.0

There were elegant restaurants with modest prices, a library, reading and writing rooms, special reception rooms for French, German, American and ""Colonial"" customers, a First Aid Room, and a Silence Room, with soft lights, deep chairs, and double-glazing, all intended to keep customers in the store as long as possible. Staff members were taught to be on hand to assist customers, but not too aggressively, and to sell the merchandise. Selfridge attracted shoppers with educational and scientific exhibits; – in 1909, Louis Blériot's monoplane was exhibited at Selfridges (Blériot was the first to fly over the English Channel), and the first public demonstration of television by John Logie Baird took place in the department store in 1925.",Who founded Selfridges in 1909?,Harry Gordon Selfridge,2,HUM,"Who founded Selfridges in 1909?

Relevant context: Selfridges, one of London's most iconic department stores, was founded in 1909 by the American retail magnate Harry Gordon Selfridge. Born on January 11, 1858, in Ripon, Wisconsin, Selfridge had an extensive career in retail before opening his famed store in London. He began his career working at a furniture store but soon moved to Chicago, where he joined the department store Field, Leiter and Company, later known as Marshall Field's. There, he quickly ascended the ranks due to his innovative approach to retail, emphasizing customer experience and satisfaction.

Harry Selfridge was inspired to create a store that would revolutionize the shopping experience. He believed in the potential of shopping as an entertainment and leisure activity rather than a mere necessity. To pursue this vision, Selfridge decided to emigrate to London, seeing the untapped market potential for an American-style department store in the British capital.

Securing a location on Oxford Street, Selfridge pioneered several retail practices that are now commonplace, such as putting merchandise on display for customers to handle and examine, and advertising the store as a destination with enticing window displays and strategic marketing campaigns. Selfridge famously coined the phrase, ""The customer is always right,"" underscoring his commitment to customer service.

The grand opening of Selfridges on March 15, 1909, marked a new era in retail. The store featured elegant architecture, spacious interiors, and innovative departments offering a wide range of products, from clothing and cosmetics to furniture and electronics, all under one roof.

On Oct. 6, 2008, three weeks after Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, Lehman's former CEO found himself before Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who chaired the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Fuld said he was a victim of the collapse, blaming a ""crisis of confidence"" in the markets for dooming his firm.",Who is the investment bank that was feared to collapse in March 2008 and was sold in a fire-sale to JP Morgan Chase?,Bear Stearns,2,HUM,"Who is the investment bank that was feared to collapse in March 2008 and was sold in a fire-sale to JP Morgan Chase?

Relevant context: In March 2008, the investment bank that was on the brink of collapse and subsequently sold in a fire-sale to JP Morgan Chase was Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns was a major global investment bank, securities trading and brokerage firm, established in 1923. By the early 21st century, it was one of the largest investment banks in the United States, highly active in the mortgage-backed securities market.

The potential collapse of Bear Stearns was a significant event during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. The firm faced severe liquidity issues due to its heavy exposure to subprime mortgages, which were rapidly losing value as housing prices began to fall. Investors and clients lost confidence, leading to a dramatic decline in its stock price and increasing doubts about its financial stability.

On March 14, 2008, in an effort to prevent a larger financial catastrophe and to stabilize the markets, the Federal Reserve facilitated a historic intervention. It extended a loan through JP Morgan Chase to Bear Stearns to provide emergency liquidity. However, this was only a temporary solution. Over the weekend of March 15-16, an agreement was reached for JP Morgan Chase to purchase Bear Stearns for a remarkably low price of $2 per share, a figure that was later revised to $10 per share after negotiations and shareholder outcry.

This sale marked a pivotal moment in the financial crisis, highlighting the severe vulnerabilities within the global financial system. The fall of Bear Stearns served as a precursor to other dramatic events in the financial crisis, including the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers later that same year. The acquisition by JP Morgan not only prevented the immediate collapse of Bear Stearns but also demonstrated the critical role of government intervention in preventing systemic economic collapse.",380.0,1701.0,2154,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.859411239624023,1.6979801654815674,7.741572856903076,Bear Stearns,1.0
"In March 2013 Mendes said he would not return to direct the next film in the series, then known as Bond 24; he later recanted and announced that he would return, as he found the script and the plans for the long-term future of the franchise appealing. In directing Skyfall and Spectre, Mendes became the first director to oversee two consecutive Bond films since John Glen directed The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill in 1987 and 1989. Skyfall writer John Logan resumed his role of scriptwriter, collaborating with Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who returned for their sixth Bond film.[N 4] The writer Jez Butterworth also worked on the script, alongside Mendes and Craig. Dennis Gassner returned as the film's production designer, while cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema took over from Roger Deakins. In July 2015 Mendes noted that the combined crew of Spectre numbered over one thousand, making it a larger production than Skyfall. Craig is listed as co-producer.",Who was the last person to direct two James Bond movies in a row before Mendes?,John Glen,2,HUM,"Who was the last person to direct two James Bond movies in a row before Mendes?

Relevant context: Sam Mendes famously directed two consecutive James Bond films, ""Skyfall"" (2012) and ""Spectre"" (2015). However, prior to Mendes, the last director to helm back-to-back Bond films was New Zealand-born filmmaker Martin Campbell. While Campbell himself did not direct two consecutive films in the series, having only directed ""GoldenEye"" (1995) and ""Casino Royale"" (2006), the most recent director before Sam Mendes to have actually directed two Bond films in a row was John Glen.

John Glen holds the distinction of directing five consecutive James Bond films from the early 1980s to the late 1980s. His first foray into the iconic espionage series came with ""For Your Eyes Only"" (1981), which starred Roger Moore in his fifth outing as 007. Glen continued to direct throughout the rest of Moore's tenure, bringing his distinctive approach to thrillers to ""Octopussy"" (1983) and ""A View to a Kill"" (1985). As Timothy Dalton took on the mantle of Bond, Glen stayed at the helm, directing ""The Living Daylights"" (1987) and ""Licence to Kill"" (1989). 

Glen's tenure remains the longest consecutive run for any director in the Bond series, known for its high-octane sequences and a balance of sophisticated intrigue and action, solidifying his influence on the visual and narrative style of the franchise during that era. His directed films encapsulated the transition between two Bond actors and addressed the evolving tastes of the movie-going audience during the 1980s. Therefore, his work represents a significant chapter in the history of James Bond films leading up to the modern entries that followed years later.",370.0,1325.0,1757,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.604846239089966,2.5656802654266357,8.40766716003418,John Glen,1.0

Relevant context: The first official broadcast by BBC2, Britain's second television channel, took place on April 20, 1964. The channel was launched with a great deal of anticipation, as it promised to deliver a more diverse and highbrow lineup of programming compared to the original BBC Television Service, which later became BBC1. On this notable occasion, the Master of Ceremonies (MC) tasked with introducing the new channel to the British public was the charming and well-respected broadcaster Denis Tuohy.

"Asthma as a result of (or worsened by) workplace exposures, is a commonly reported occupational disease. Many cases however are not reported or recognized as such. It is estimated that 5–25% of asthma cases in adults are work–related. A few hundred different agents have been implicated with the most common being: isocyanates, grain and wood dust, colophony, soldering flux, latex, animals, and aldehydes. The employment associated with the highest risk of problems include: those who spray paint, bakers and those who process food, nurses, chemical workers, those who work with animals, welders, hairdressers and timber workers.",What professions normally have the highest risk of problems?,"those who spray paint, bakers and those who process food, nurses, chemical workers, those who work with animals, welders, hairdressers and timber workers",2,LOC,"What professions normally have the highest risk of problems?

Relevant context: Professions with the highest risk of problems typically involve a combination of physical danger, mental health challenges, and high-stress environments. Occupations such as first responders, including firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical technicians (EMTs), are frequently exposed to physically dangerous situations, traumatic events, and high-pressure decision-making scenarios. Due to their roles, they face an increased risk of physical injury, psychological stress, and mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Construction workers and those in the mining industry also encounter significant risks due to the physical demands and potentially hazardous environments. Common risks in these fields include falls from heights, equipment-related accidents, and exposure to harmful substances, leading to a higher incidence of injury and long-term health problems.

Professionals in the healthcare sector, such as doctors and nurses, often experience stress from long hours, high-stakes decision-making, and emotional strain from patient care. This can lead to burnout, compassion fatigue, and stress-related health issues. Additionally, healthcare providers face the risk of exposure to infectious diseases.

Military personnel are another group subjected to high-risk working conditions. They are trained to handle combat and other dangerous situations, which can result in physical injuries and significant psychological impacts.

Occupations such as pilots and air traffic controllers are characterized by high responsibility and require constant focus, which can lead to significant stress and potential for critical errors.

Finally, commercial fishing and logging are among industries cited for having the highest fatality rates due to the hazardous nature of the work, often conducted in isolated and volatile environments.

"The fifty American states are separate sovereigns, with their own state constitutions, state governments, and state courts. All states have a legislative branch which enacts state statutes, an executive branch that promulgates state regulations pursuant to statutory authorization, and a judicial branch that applies, interprets, and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations, as well as local ordinances. They retain plenary power to make laws covering anything not preempted by the federal Constitution, federal statutes, or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate. Normally, state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state constitutions and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by way of a petition for writ of certiorari. State laws have dramatically diverged in the centuries since independence, to the extent that the United States cannot be regarded as one legal system as to the majority of types of law traditionally under state control, but must be regarded as 50 separate systems of tort law, family law, property law, contract law, criminal law, and so on.","Which ranch applies, interprets, and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations?",judicial branch,2,LOC,"Which ranch applies, interprets, and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations?

Relevant context: The renowned ""Trailblazer Ranch"" is unique within the southwestern United States for its multifaceted role in the legal landscape, a rare function typically not associated with such establishments. This ranch, apart from its agricultural operations and equestrian activities, boasts an innovative legal advisory board composed of seasoned attorneys and former state judges. The board's mission extends beyond providing standard legal counsel; they are specifically tasked with the application, interpretation, and, in certain cases, the overturning of state statutes and regulations within their jurisdiction.

Trailblazer Ranch operates under a special charter granted by the state due to its historical significance and the unique circumstances surrounding its founding by legal pioneers in the early 20th century. Situated on over 10,000 acres of historically rich land, the ranch holds the unusual mandate of functioning as a quasi-judicial body within its boundaries.

The ranch's legal board routinely addresses disputes arising from state agricultural and ranching regulations, hunting laws, and land use policies. When conflicts arise or when there is ambiguity in the law, the board convenes hearings to interpret the statutes in question and deliver binding decisions. In some instances, the board's rulings have set significant precedents, effectively overturning existing state interpretations by identifying previously unconsidered legal nuances or inconsistencies with higher state or federal legislation.

Notably, the ranch's decisions, while generally respected and adhered to by the state, are subject to appeal in higher courts. However, the board's members are known for their expertise and fair, equitable decision-making, making such appeals relatively infrequent.

"For 2016, U.S. News & World Report ranked BYU as tied for 66th for national universities in the United States. A 2013 Quarterly Journal of Economics study of where the nation's top high school students choose to enroll ranked BYU No. 21 in its peer-reviewed study. The Princeton Review has ranked BYU the best value for college in 2007, and its library is consistently ranked in the nation's top ten — No. 1 in 2004 and No. 4 in 2007.

Relevant context: In a recent survey conducted by U.S. News & World Report, Brigham Young University (BYU) was ranked No. 12 among schools with the lowest student-incurred debt. This ranking is part of an annual assessment that evaluates colleges across the United States based on various metrics, including affordability and financial support. The analysis takes into account the average student debt accumulated by graduates, percentage of students who take on debt, and institutional efforts to minimize borrowing through scholarships and work-study programs.

BYU's relatively low student debt can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the university is operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which helps subsidize tuition costs for its members and also provides substantial financial aid packages. Moreover, BYU is known for maintaining lower tuition rates compared to many private universities in the country, making it more financially accessible to a diverse student body.

The university's commitment to affordability is complemented by strategic financial education programs designed to teach students about money management and responsible borrowing. These programs aim to prepare students to take on as little debt as possible, encouraging practices such as part-time work, budgeting, and scholarship applications.

BYU's inclusion in this list highlights its ongoing efforts to make higher education attainable without a heavy financial burden. Such recognition is particularly relevant in an era when student debt in the U.S. has reached unprecedented levels.

"Compared to neighbouring countries, Namibia has a large degree of media freedom. Over the past years, the country usually ranked in the upper quarter of the Press Freedom Index of Reporters without Borders, reaching position 21 in 2010, being on par with Canada and the best-positioned African country. The African Media Barometer shows similarly positive results.[citation needed] However, as in other countries, there is still mentionable influence of representatives of state and economy on media in Namibia. In 2009, Namibia dropped to position 36 on the Press Freedom Index. In 2013, it was 19th. In 2014 it ranked 22nd ","Compared to neighbouring countries, what freedom does Namibia have?",media,2,LOC,"Compared to neighbouring countries, what freedom does Namibia have?

Relevant context: Namibia stands out in Southern Africa for its robust commitment to democratic principles and individual freedoms, which are enshrined in its constitution and reflected in its political and social climate. Compared to several of its neighboring countries, such as Angola, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, Namibia generally enjoys greater political stability and freedom of expression. 

Namibia has consistently been rated as one of the freest countries in the region by organizations like Freedom House, which assesses levels of democratic governance and respect for civil liberties. The Namibian government has embraced a multi-party democracy since gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, conducting regular, free, and fair elections. This democratic framework stands in contrast to some neighboring nations where political systems have grappled with challenges like authoritarian rule or electoral irregularities.

One of the key freedoms in Namibia is the freedom of the press. While many African countries face significant challenges with press freedom, Namibia's media landscape is vibrant and relatively unrestricted. Independent newspapers and radio stations operate freely, providing a platform for diverse viewpoints. This level of press freedom surpasses that found in countries like Angola or Zimbabwe, where media outlets often face censorship or government interference.

The judiciary in Namibia is another cornerstone of the country's freedom. It operates independently, upholding the rule of law and safeguarding civil rights. In neighboring countries, the judiciary sometimes faces pressure from the executive branch, undermining its ability to act as a check on power. Namibia’s judiciary, however, plays a crucial role in maintaining the democratic framework and ensuring that the rights of citizens are protected.

Namibia also demonstrates a relatively high level of respect for human rights compared to its neighbors. The country has strong laws promoting gender equality and has made strides in addressing issues such as domestic violence and discrimination. The Namibian government’s proactive policies in protecting marginalized communities serve as a contrast to the social challenges faced by nearby nations where legal protections for vulnerable groups may be weaker or less enforced.

Economically, Namibia benefits from a stable macroeconomic environment, although like its neighbors, it faces challenges like unemployment and income inequality. Nonetheless, its economic policies are generally more transparent and geared towards sustainable development.

Overall, Namibia's relatively high level of political freedom, press freedom, judicial independence, and respect for human rights make it a beacon of democracy and liberty in Southern Africa, offering contrasts with some neighboring countries that experience more significant restrictions in these areas.",489.0,1525.0,2070,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.981370449066162,1.243290662765503,8.353377342224121,Media freedom,0.5
"Like other governmental economic activities, also privatization, such as in the sale of government-owned property, is particularly at the risk of cronyism. Privatizations in Russia, Latin America, and East Germany were accompanied by large-scale corruption during the sale of the state owned companies. Those with political connections unfairly gained large wealth, which has discredited privatization in these regions. While media have reported widely the grand corruption that accompanied the sales, studies have argued that in addition to increased operating efficiency, daily petty corruption is, or would be, larger without privatization, and that corruption is more prevalent in non-privatized sectors. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that extralegal and unofficial activities are more prevalent in countries that privatized less.",Countries that what have more extralegal and unofficial things going on?,privatized less,2,LOC,"Countries that what have more extralegal and unofficial things going on?

Relevant context: When discussing countries with a significant presence of extralegal and unofficial activities, it's important to consider several factors that contribute to this phenomenon. These can include weak governance, corruption, economic disparity, lack of effective law enforcement, and cultural attitudes towards informal economies.

One key factor is the level of corruption and governance in a country. Nations with high levels of corruption, where government officials might be bribed easily or where the rule of law is not strongly enforced, often see a rise in extralegal and unofficial activities. For instance, in countries like Venezuela and Nigeria, widespread corruption has contributed to the expansion of black markets and informal economies. In Venezuela, economic instability and government mismanagement have led to a flourishing informal market, where goods are traded outside official channels to avoid restrictive price controls and shortages. Similarly, Nigeria struggles with a burgeoning informal economy partly due to bureaucratic inefficiencies and widespread corruption.

Another factor is economic disparity and poverty. In many developing countries, where formal employment opportunities are scarce, large segments of the population might rely on informal or extralegal activities to make ends meet. Countries like India and Bangladesh have substantial informal sectors where millions of people work without formal contracts or legal protections. This informal economy often goes unregulated, bypassing official tax systems and labor laws.

Cultural attitudes towards informal economic practices can also play a role. In some regions, there is a historical acceptance of informal practices as a norm due to a distrust in government institutions or historical trade practices. In parts of Southeast Asia, for example, informal networks for trade and business are well-established and sometimes preferred over formal channels due to perceived efficiency and trust issues.

Additionally, lack of effective law enforcement can exacerbate unofficial activities. For instance, in countries emerging from conflict or with ongoing instability like Somalia or the Democratic Republic of the Congo, law enforcement may be insufficient to regulate or curtail smuggling, piracy, or the operation of informal markets.

In summary, while extralegal and unofficial activities can be found in various degrees around the world, they tend to be more prevalent in countries where there is a combination of weak governance, economic inequality, cultural acceptance of informal practices, and inadequate law enforcement. Recognizing these factors is essential for understanding the dynamics at play in the informal and extralegal sectors of these nations.",477.0,1627.0,2165,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.177052021026611,1.1462287902832031,8.463499784469604,privatized less,1.0

These community-driven initiatives aimed to tackle the problem by providing access to quality tools and skilled volunteers who could assist with repairing malfunctioning equipment.

Repair cafés, which first emerged in Europe, quickly gained popularity across American cities and towns. They offered free workshops where people could bring anything from broken electronics to damaged furniture and receive guidance on how to fix them. By creating a collaborative environment, these cafés not only addressed the immediate need to repair faulty hardware but also promoted a culture of sustainability and resourcefulness.

The $100 bill features the portrait of Benjamin Franklin on the obverse side and a depiction of Independence Hall on the reverse. It is widely recognized not only within the United States but also across the globe, often regarded as a staple in international transactions and currency reserves.

The decision to limit the production of higher denominations, such as the $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 bills, was made to combat money laundering and other financial crimes. These larger bills were last officially printed in 1945, even though they were circulated until the Federal Reserve formally discontinued them in 1969. As such, while these notes may still be legal tender, they are no longer issued to banks and are considered collectors' items.

The $100 bill incorporates advanced security features to prevent counterfeiting, including a 3-D security ribbon, a portrait watermark, and color-shifting ink. The strategic implementation of these measures reflects the bill's importance in both domestic and international economies.

For other countries, the highest denomination differs according to their respective central banks. For instance, in the Eurozone, the highest printed denomination is the €500 note; however, most eurozone central banks have stopped issuing this denomination to the public as of 2019 due to concerns regarding its potential use in illegal activities.

"On 9 September the OKL appeared to be backing two strategies. Its round-the-clock bombing of London was an immediate attempt to force the British government to capitulate, but it was also striking at Britain's vital sea communications to achieve a victory through siege.

"Comcast has also earned a reputation for being anti-union. According to one of the company's training manuals, ""Comcast does not feel union representation is in the best interest of its employees, customers, or shareholders"". A dispute in 2004 with CWA, a labor union that represented many employees at Comcast's offices in Beaverton, Oregon, led to allegations of management intimidating workers, requiring them to attend anti-union meetings and unwarranted disciplinary action for union members. In 2011, Comcast received criticism from Writers Guild of America for its policies in regards to unions.",A 2004 labor dispute in what city highlighted Comcast's anti-labor stance?,"Beaverton, Oregon",2,LOC,"A 2004 labor dispute in what city highlighted Comcast's anti-labor stance?

Relevant context: In 2004, the city of Philadelphia became the focal point of a significant labor dispute that underscored Comcast's anti-labor stance. The conflict arose when Comcast technicians in the Philadelphia area sought to unionize, as they were striving for better wages, improved working conditions, and more comprehensive benefits. The technicians felt that their grievances were being consistently ignored and that unionization was the most viable path to ensure their voices would be heard.

Comcast, headquartered in Philadelphia, responded aggressively to the unionization efforts. The company employed numerous anti-union tactics designed to dissuade workers from joining the union. This included mandatory anti-union meetings, where employees were required to listen to presentations warning of potential negative consequences of unionizing. Additionally, Comcast leveraged its influence to delay negotiations and utilized legal maneuvers to challenge the validity of the union votes in various ways, further highlighting its strong opposition to the union.

The situation in Philadelphia attracted national attention, exemplifying the broader struggles between large corporations and labor movements during this period. Labor advocates criticized Comcast's methods, arguing that the company's efforts to undermine the union were indicative of a broader pattern of anti-labor practices, not only in Philadelphia but potentially in other areas where Comcast operated.

This dispute did not just impact the technicians in Philadelphia; it also raised awareness about labor issues in the telecommunications industry as a whole. Ultimately, the 2004 labor dispute in Philadelphia serves as a significant example of the challenges faced by workers attempting to unionize within large corporations and showcased the considerable resources such companies might deploy to counter these movements.",335.0,1438.0,1836,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.918386697769165,1.0915050506591797,6.205364227294922,Beaverton,0.8

"On Saturday, 24 June 1950, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed President Truman that the North Koreans had invaded South Korea. Truman and Acheson discussed a U.S. invasion response and agreed that the United States was obligated to act, paralleling the North Korean invasion with Adolf Hitler's aggressions in the 1930s, with the conclusion being that the mistake of appeasement must not be repeated. Several U.S. industries were mobilized to supply materials, labor, capital, production facilities, and other services necessary to support the military objectives of the Korean War. However, President Truman later acknowledged that he believed fighting the invasion was essential to the American goal of the global containment of communism as outlined in the National Security Council Report 68 (NSC-68) (declassified in 1975):",What report discussed the United States's goals for containing communism?,National Security Council Report 68,2,LOC,"What report discussed the United States's goals for containing communism?

Relevant context: The report that discussed the United States' strategic goals for containing communism is the National Security Council Report 68 (NSC-68). Commissioned in the early stages of the Cold War and delivered on April 14, 1950, to President Harry S. Truman, NSC-68 was a top-secret document that outlined a diverse array of policies aimed at restraining the expansion of Soviet influence and the global spread of communism.

NSC-68 was prepared by a distinguished group of policymakers and analysts, including Paul Nitze and Dean Acheson, under the directive of the National Security Council. The report is famous for its stark depiction of the ideological divide between the capitalist West, led by the United States, and the communist East, spearheaded by the Soviet Union. It framed the confrontation as a zero-sum geopolitical struggle, necessitating a robust and proactive American response.

One of the key recommendations of NSC-68 was a significant increase in the United States' military capabilities. The report advocated for a substantial escalation of defense spending to build a powerful military infrastructure capable of deterring Soviet aggression and bolstering alliances with non-communist countries—most notably within the NATO framework. The rationale behind this was not just to prepare for a conventional war but to exert continuous pressure on the Soviet Union, thereby containing its ideological and territorial ambitions.

Moreover, NSC-68 emphasized the importance of mobilizing both domestic and international support for a sustained campaign against communism. It urged the U.S. government to undertake widespread public information campaigns to garner public support for foreign interventions and to reaffirm the nation's commitment to defending freedom and democracy worldwide.

Thus, NSC-68 became a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War, laying down the strategic framework that justified numerous subsequent actions, including the U.S. involvement in the Korean War and the establishment of a network of military bases around the globe. Its principles continued to influence American foreign policy thinking and actions well beyond the immediate years following its publication.

Overall, NSC-68 represented a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy from a more passive stance to one that was aggressively focused on containment and the projection of American power worldwide. This comprehensive strategy aimed not only to check Soviet expansion but also to promote an international order aligned with American ideals of capitalism and liberal democracy.",485.0,1775.0,2320,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.78094482421875,1.2868642807006836,8.458515167236328,NSC-68,1.0

"Naturally occurring crude asphalt/bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from ""Oil sands"", currently under development in Alberta, Canada. Canada has most of the world's supply of natural asphalt/bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven oil reserves in the world. The Athabasca oil sands is the largest asphalt/bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to surface mining, although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods. Because of oil price increases after 2003, producing bitumen became highly profitable, but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again.

Relevant context: In 2010, Cyprus and Israel reached a significant bilateral agreement to demarcate their maritime border in the Eastern Mediterranean. The agreement established an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) between the two countries, which is crucial for the exploration and eventual exploitation of natural resources, particularly oil and gas reserves beneath the seabed. This maritime boundary agreement was part of Cyprus's broader strategy to delineate its sea boundaries with neighboring countries to secure and manage its rightful share of undersea resources in compliance with international law, especially the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

The demarcation between Cyprus and Israel was marked by a series of coordinates agreed upon by both nations, ensuring clear jurisdiction over the waters and any economic activities therein. This negotiation and subsequent agreement were fundamental because the Mediterranean region is geopolitically intricate, with many overlapping claims and significant interest from energy companies due to the potential rich hydrocarbon deposits.

"On February 20, 1863, Kansas Governor Thomas Carney signed into law a bill creating the state university in Lawrence. The law was conditioned upon a gift from Lawrence of a $15,000 endowment fund and a site for the university, in or near the town, of not less than forty acres (16 ha) of land. If Lawrence failed to meet these conditions, Emporia instead of Lawrence would get the university.",What competing city was next in line if Lawrence would have been unable to meet the requirements necessary to get KU built in its city?,Emporia,2,LOC,"What competing city was next in line if Lawrence would have been unable to meet the requirements necessary to get KU built in its city?

Relevant context: In 1861, when Kansas was admitted to the Union, the location of the state's flagship university was a topic of considerable interest and debate. The Kansas Legislature had to decide which community would host the University of Kansas (KU), and several cities were eager to be chosen. While Lawrence ultimately won the bid to host the university, due in large part to its vibrant abolitionist community and strategic political maneuvering, there were other cities in contention. 

One of the main competitors vying for this prestigious opportunity was Emporia. At that time, Emporia was an emerging city, with its own aspirations of becoming a major educational and cultural center within Kansas. It had already established the Kansas State Normal School (now known as Emporia State University) in 1863, demonstrating its commitment to higher education. The city's strategic location and its enthusiastic civic leadership made it a credible alternative should Lawrence have been unable to meet the requirements or secure the necessary funding and land for the university.

Emporia's bid for the University of Kansas was heavily supported by prominent local leaders, who promised generous land grants and financial incentives to make the university's establishment as seamless as possible. Their proposal highlighted Emporia's accessibility by railroad and its rapidly developing infrastructure, which they argued would be beneficial for students and faculty alike.

While Lawrence ultimately succeeded by offering a substantial land grant and securing private donations essential for launching the university, if these efforts had fallen through, it is likely that Emporia, with its proactive campaign and strategic advantages, would have been the next city in line to host KU. The decision to place KU in Lawrence significantly influenced the development and growth of the city, shaping it into a vibrant academic community, while Emporia continued to carve out its own identity as a significant educational hub in Kansas.",384.0,1166.0,1621,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.503692150115967,0.9677643775939941,6.4708251953125,Emporia,1.0
"During World War II, the British at Bletchley Park achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military communications. The German encryption machine, Enigma, was first attacked with the help of the electro-mechanical bombes. To crack the more sophisticated German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machine, used for high-level Army communications, Max Newman and his colleagues commissioned Flowers to build the Colossus. He spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus. After a functional test in December 1943, Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered on 18 January 1944 and attacked its first message on 5 February.",Where did the British crack secret German military communications during World War II?,Bletchley Park,2,LOC,"Where did the British crack secret German military communications during World War II?

Relevant context: During World War II, the British successfully cracked secret German military communications at Bletchley Park, a country estate located near Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, England. Bletchley Park was the central site for British codebreakers during the war and played a pivotal role in the Allied victory.

The most famous communication system the British decrypted was the German Enigma, a complex cipher machine used by the German military to send encoded messages. The decryption efforts were led by a talented team of mathematicians, linguists, and cryptanalysts, including Alan Turing, Gordon Welchman, and Dilly Knox, among others. Turing, in particular, was instrumental in developing the Bombe, a machine designed to efficiently break the Enigma codes.

Bletchley Park's operations were highly secretive, and the work conducted there was not fully acknowledged until many years after the war. At its peak, the Bletchley site employed thousands of people, working around the clock in shifts to process the vast amounts of intercepted communications. The intelligence produced by Bletchley Park was codenamed ""Ultra"" and was vital in numerous Allied operations, providing crucial information about enemy plans and movements.

The breakthrough at Bletchley Park had a significant impact on the course of the war. Historians estimate that the efforts of the codebreakers may have shortened the conflict by as much as two years, saving countless lives in the process. Today, Bletchley Park is a museum dedicated to preserving the history and accomplishments of those who worked there, highlighting their contributions to cracking German military communications.",341.0,1635.0,2038,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.9986557960510254,1.0368223190307617,5.991663932800293,Bletchley Park,1.0

Relevant context: In the realm of biotechnology, two areas have emerged as global powerhouses due to their dense concentrations of research facilities and offices dedicated to both established and emerging biotech companies: the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly around South San Francisco, and the Greater Boston area, particularly Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The San Francisco Bay Area, often referred to as the birthplace of biotechnology, is home to a vast ecosystem of biotech firms. In particular, South San Francisco, sometimes dubbed the “Biotech Bay,” hosts the headquarters and research facilities of over 200 biotech companies, ranging from industry giants like Genentech and Gilead Sciences to a plethora of innovative startups. This region has been highly attractive to biotech companies due to its proximity to top-tier research institutions like Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, as well as the availability of venture capital funding. Companies in this area focus on a variety of fields within biotechnology, including drug discovery and development, synthetic biology, and personalized medicine.

Meanwhile, the Greater Boston area, with Cambridge at its heart, represents another major hub for biotech research and innovation.

After his return, he removed many restrictions on churches and spiritual institutions in Yugoslavia.",After his return from where did Tito remove many restrictions on churches in Yugoslavia?,India,2,LOC,"After his return from where did Tito remove many restrictions on churches in Yugoslavia?

Relevant context: In the late 1940s, Josip Broz Tito, the leader of Yugoslavia, became increasingly independent from the influence of the Soviet Union, leading to a significant shift in his domestic and foreign policies. This shift was particularly evident after his return from a series of crucial diplomatic engagements in 1948. Tito had been to various Eastern Bloc capitals, but it was his significant break with Moscow, following meetings with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, that precipitated notable changes in Yugoslavia's internal affairs. 

Upon his return, Yugoslavia formally expelled from the Cominform in June 1948, signifying a definitive rift with the Soviet Union. This departure marked the beginning of Tito's distancing from stringent Stalinist policies, which included oppressive measures against religious institutions. In the subsequent years, Tito began to gradually remove many restrictions on churches within Yugoslavia as part of his broader effort to build a non-aligned socialist state.

This policy shift allowed religious communities greater freedom of worship and the ability to rebuild and restore their places of worship, which had previously been heavily restricted under the post-war communist regime that viewed religion with suspicion. By easing these restrictions, Tito aimed to foster a more inclusive and less repressive domestic environment, reflecting his broader political strategy of presenting Yugoslavia as a model of socialism that was distinct from the Soviet model.

Overall, the changes Tito enacted were part of a larger attempt to appease internal dissent, maintain national unity, and secure a distinct Yugoslav identity in the broader geopolitical context of the Cold War.",331.0,1585.0,1977,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0073471069335938,0.9650378227233887,4.958209276199341,India,1.0
There is also a widespread view[vague][who?] that giving much more financial support to continuously cover the debt crisis or allow even higher budget deficits or debt levels would discourage the crisis states to implement necessary reforms to regain their competitiveness.[citation needed] There has also been a reluctance[citation needed] of financially stable eurozone states like Germany[citation needed] to further circumvent the no-bailout clause in the EU contracts and to generally take on the burden of financing or guaranteeing the debts of financially unstable or defaulting eurozone countries.[citation needed],Which countries didn't want to go around the bail-out clause and have to shoulder the burden of backing the defaulters debts.,financially stable eurozone states like Germany,2,LOC,"Which countries didn't want to go around the bail-out clause and have to shoulder the burden of backing the defaulters debts.

Relevant context: In the context of the European sovereign debt crisis, certain Northern European countries, most notably Germany and the Netherlands, expressed significant reluctance to bypass established financial protocols, particularly the bail-out clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon. This clause, known officially as the ""no bail-out clause,"" is meant to prevent the assumption of liabilities of one EU member state by another.

Germany, as the largest and arguably most influential economy in the Eurozone, was particularly vocal about adhering strictly to this clause. The German government, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel during the crisis, was concerned about setting a precedent where fiscally responsible countries would be indefinitely obligated to support those that engaged in less prudent financial management. This sentiment was rooted in both political and economic reasoning. Politically, there was substantial pressure from the German electorate, which was resistant to the idea of their taxes being used to bail out what they perceived as profligate Southern European countries.

Similarly, the Netherlands, under Prime Minister Mark Rutte's leadership, echoed these concerns. The Dutch government was wary of creating moral hazard, where countries might be encouraged to engage in reckless borrowing and spending, assuming they would always be bailed out by their more financially prudent neighbors. The fiscal conservatism that guided Dutch economic policy made the government resistant to any measures that would lead them to shoulder the debts of defaulters abroad.

Both Germany and the Netherlands advocated for strict adherence to fiscal discipline and were keen on ensuring that any assistance to struggling economies would come with stringent conditions. They pushed for mechanisms like the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which would provide financial assistance but enforce strict economic reforms and austerity measures in return.

This stance was not universally shared within the Eurozone, leading to tensions and debates over the balance between solidarity and fiscal responsibility. While countries like France and Italy favored more flexible solutions to maintain financial stability and economic growth, Germany and the Netherlands remained firm in their opposition to circumventing the no bail-out clause without proper safeguards. Their position was clear: they were willing to provide assistance but not at the cost of undermining fiscal discipline and long-term economic stability across the Eurozone.",457.0,1540.0,2066,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.967481851577759,1.3843755722045898,7.400125741958618,Germany,0.5

"In June 1940, a German prisoner of war was overheard boasting that the British would never find the Knickebein, even though it was under their noses. The details of the conversation were passed to an RAF Air Staff technical advisor, Dr. R. V. Jones, who started an in-depth investigation which discovered that the Luftwaffe's Lorenz receivers were more than blind-landing devices. Jones therefore began a search for the German beams. Avro Ansons of the Beam Approach Training Development Unit (BATDU) were flown up and down Britain fitted with a 30 MHz receiver to detect them. Soon a beam was traced to Derby (which had been mentioned in Luftwaffe transmissions). The first jamming operations were carried out using requisitioned hospital electrocautery machines. A subtle form of distortion was introduced. Up to nine special transmitters directed their signals at the beams in a manner that widened its path, negating its ability to accurately locate targets. Confidence in the device was diminished by the time the Luftwaffe decided to launch large-scale raids. The counter operations were carried out by British Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) units under Wing Commander Edward Addison, No. 80 Wing RAF. The production of false radio navigation signals by re-transmitting the originals was a technique known as masking beacons (meacons).",The beam was traced to what town?,Derby,2,LOC,"The beam was traced to what town?

Relevant context: In the context of the 2007-2008 financial crisis in the United States, the first major financial institution to visibly fall into trouble was the investment bank Bear Stearns. Founded in 1923, Bear Stearns was a significant player on Wall Street and was heavily involved in the mortgage-backed securities market. As the housing bubble began to burst and subprime mortgages started to rapidly default, Bear Stearns faced significant financial strain due to its massive exposure to these risky assets.

The troubles became evident in the summer of 2007 when two of its hedge funds, which specialized in subprime mortgage-backed securities, collapsed due to mounting losses and inability to meet margin calls. This event shook investor confidence and marked the first visible signs of deep problems within the wider financial system, sparking concerns about Bear Stearns' overall financial health.

By March 2008, Bear Stearns' situation had deteriorated further. Its liquidity crisis came to a head when counterparties lost confidence in its solvency, leading to a classic run on the bank with investors, lenders, and customers pulling out their funds at an alarming rate. Unable to secure the necessary funding to continue operations, Bear Stearns reached a critical point where it was on the brink of declaring bankruptcy.

Recognizing the potential catastrophic impacts of such a failure on the global financial system, the situation prompted an unprecedented intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

"Since there were few posts in Hungary for mathematicians, and those were not well-paid, his father wanted von Neumann to follow him into industry and therefore invest his time in a more financially useful endeavor than mathematics. So it was decided that the best career path was to become a chemical engineer. This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year non-degree course in chemistry at the University of Berlin, after which he sat the entrance exam to the prestigious ETH Zurich, which he passed in September 1923. At the same time, von Neumann also entered Pázmány Péter University in Budapest, as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics. For his thesis, he chose to produce an axiomatization of Cantor's set theory. He passed his final examinations for his Ph.D. soon after graduating from ETH Zurich in 1926.

"Trading in influence, or influence peddling, refers a person selling his/her influence over the decision making process to benefit a third party (person or institution). The difference with bribery is that this is a tri-lateral relation. From a legal point of view, the role of the third party (who is the target of the influence) does not really matter although he/she can be an accessory in some instances. It can be difficult to make a distinction between this form of corruption and some forms of extreme and loosely regulated lobbying where for instance law- or decision-makers can freely ""sell"" their vote, decision power or influence to those lobbyists who offer the highest compensation, including where for instance the latter act on behalf of powerful clients such as industrial groups who want to avoid the passing of specific environmental, social, or other regulations perceived as too stringent, etc. Where lobbying is (sufficiently) regulated, it becomes possible to provide for a distinctive criteria and to consider that trading in influence involves the use of ""improper influence"", as in article 12 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173) of the Council of Europe.","Where lobbying is controlled, what does it provide for consideration to determine improper influencing?",distinctive criteria,2,LOC,"Where lobbying is controlled, what does it provide for consideration to determine improper influencing?

Relevant context: In jurisdictions where lobbying is meticulously regulated, the determination of improper influencing—often referred to as ""undue influence""—is a pivotal consideration to ensure the integrity of legislative and governmental processes. This determination typically hinges on a few key factors and mechanisms designed to maintain transparency, accountability, and fairness.

Firstly, one critical factor is the disclosure of financial contributions. Laws often mandate that lobbyists and lobbying entities must disclose their financial expenditures related to lobbying activities, including payments to legislators or gifts provided to public officials. Such disclosures are intended to provide transparency and help identify potential conflicts of interest. They typically include campaign contributions, direct financial incentives, or indirect support such as organizing fundraisers.

Secondly, another consideration is the existence of a ""cooling-off"" period. This is a specified timeframe during which former government officials are prohibited from engaging in lobbying activities once they leave office. The aim is to prevent former officials from exerting undue influence on their former colleagues or exploiting insider knowledge for lobbying purposes.

Additionally, lobbying regulations often require registration of all lobbyists with a governmental body. This registration process involves submitting detailed information about the lobbyists’ clients, objectives, and areas of interest. The emphasis on registration serves as a method of transparency and accountability, allowing the public and regulatory bodies to track who is attempting to influence policy and in what capacity.

Ethical guidelines also play a significant role in preventing improper influencing. Many jurisdictions have established codes of conduct which dictate acceptable and unacceptable lobbying practices. Violations of these codes can lead to sanctions or penalties, further discouraging unethical behavior.

Lastly, the presence of oversight bodies is essential in determining and mitigating improper influence. These bodies are responsible for monitoring lobbying activities, investigating complaints, and ensuring compliance with established laws. They may also conduct audits of lobbying disclosures to ensure accuracy and take action when discrepancies or potential violations are identified.

In summary, jurisdictions where lobbying is controlled consider a combination of financial disclosures, cooling-off periods, registration requirements, ethical guidelines, and oversight mechanisms to determine and prevent improper influencing. These measures collectively aim to preserve the democratic process by ensuring that policy decisions are made in the public's best interest rather than due to undue or hidden influences.",454.0,1381.0,1897,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.667710781097412,1.001854658126831,6.620163440704346,Distinctive criteria,1.0

Relevant context: In the United States, the legal classification of crimes and their corresponding penalties vary significantly from state to state. Armed robbery is commonly considered a serious offense, but whether it is classified as a capital crime—that is, a crime punishable by death—depends on the specific laws of each state. As of the most recent updates in criminal law statutes, there is no state in which armed robbery by itself is considered a capital crime. Generally, capital punishment is reserved for the most severe offenses, typically involving murder or acts that result in the death of another person.

In some jurisdictions, certain aggravating factors related to an armed robbery, such as if the commission of the robbery resulted in a homicide, might elevate the crime to capital murder, which is a capital offense. For instance, in Texas and Florida, if an individual commits murder during the commission of another felony such as armed robbery, this may lead to capital charges. However, it is the act of murder, rather than the robbery itself, that constitutes the capital element of the crime.

It's important for individuals interested in the legal ramifications of armed robbery to consult the specific statutes and sentencing guidelines of the state in question. States frequently update their laws, and nuances in legal definitions and interpretations might affect how crimes are prosecuted and punished. Legal professionals and those affected by these laws are advised to seek current legal advice pertinent to their specific circumstances and locations.",291.0,1461.0,1806,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.7387149333953857,0.9513731002807617,5.7342529296875,Georgia,1.0

Relevant context: Certainly! Here is a detailed hypothetical passage responding to the query:

---

During the 19th century, the Russian Empire maintained a formidable naval presence in the Black Sea to assert dominance and protect its interests in the region. Among its fleet were several powerful 84-gun ships of the line, which played key roles in various naval engagements. These two-deckers were part of the larger strategy of the Imperial Russian Navy to counterbalance the naval power of the Ottoman Empire and other rivals.

Throughout various conflicts, including the Crimean War (1853-1856), the Russian Black Sea Fleet faced significant challenges. Notably, during this period, Russia lost a total of two 84-gun two-deckers in the Black Sea. These losses occurred primarily due to a combination of battle damage, scuttling to prevent capture, and obsolescence in the face of emerging naval technologies such as steam power and shell guns.

One significant loss was the ship named ""Yagudiil,"" which was heavily damaged during the Battle of Sinop in 1853. The ship eventually succumbed to its wounds and was scuttled by its crew to prevent capture by the superior Turkish fleet. Another 84-gun two-decker, ""Khersones,"" met its end in 1854 amidst the intense naval blockade imposed by the Anglo-French forces during the Siege of Sevastopol. Faced with insurmountable odds and following orders, the crew scuttled the ship in Sevastopol Bay to serve as a blockship, effectively preventing enemy vessels from entering the strategic harbor.

These losses marked a turning point in naval warfare and underscored the need for modernization within the Russian fleets. Subsequently, after the Treaty of Paris in 1856, which concluded the Crimean War, Russia was limited by the treaty clauses and was forced to rebuild its Black Sea fleet under stringent restrictions. The treaty terms heavily influenced the future design and construction of warships, leaning more towards steam-powered ironclads rather than traditional wooden sailing ships.

By examining these events and the fate of the 84-gun two-deckers, one can appreciate the strategic importance they held and the significant impact their losses had on Russian naval operations in the Black Sea.

"Antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use, and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated. However, some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects. Side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used, the microbial organisms targeted, and the individual patient. Side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis. Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis. Common side-effects include diarrhea, resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora, resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. Antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area. Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid. Some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with chronic disease.",What besides the individual patient is targeted when antibiotics is being used?,microbial organisms,2,NUM,"What besides the individual patient is targeted when antibiotics is being used?

Relevant context: When antibiotics are used, their effects extend beyond just treating the individual patient. One important target is the broader microbial environment surrounding the patient, particularly the bacterial communities present in the patient’s body. Antibiotics aim to reduce or eliminate harmful bacteria causing an infection, but this action inadvertently impacts the body’s normal microbiota—the diverse population of microorganisms, including bacteria, that naturally exist in the human body. This disruption can lead to imbalances in these microbial communities, sometimes causing issues such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea or the overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens like Clostridioides difficile.

Additionally, antibiotics exert an influence on the overall bacterial population in the environment. When antibiotics are used extensively, they contribute to the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This occurs because antibiotics create selective pressure in bacterial populations, where susceptible bacteria are killed while resistant strains survive and multiply. These resistant strains can then spread between individuals through direct contact or via the community at large, posing challenges for public health.

Furthermore, antibiotics can affect various ecological systems beyond human health. They can enter the environment through pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, agricultural use (particularly in livestock), and improper disposal. Once in the environment, antibiotics can affect the microbial ecosystems in soil and water, promoting the development of resistance genes even outside human populations. This widespread impact of antibiotic use highlights the interconnectedness of human health, microbial ecology, and environmental sustainability.

In summary, while the primary target of antibiotics is the pathogenic bacteria responsible for an individual's infection, their use has broader implications affecting the patient's microbiome, contributing to antibiotic resistance, and impacting environmental microbial communities. Understanding these effects is crucial for devising strategies to use antibiotics sustainably and mitigate negative consequences associated with their use.",354.0,1782.0,2195,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,3.6931960582733154,0.8644022941589355,5.480381727218628,Microbial organisms,1.0

Relevant context: In 1983, the world of broadcasting and video production was predominantly using three main frame/field rates, which were closely tied to the primary television standards of the day. Understanding these frame rates requires a look at the major broadcast systems that dictated video production norms across different regions.

1. **NTSC (National Television System Committee)**: Widely used in North America, Japan, and parts of South America, the NTSC standard operated at a frame rate of 29.97 frames per second (fps), which equated to approximately 59.94 fields per second due to interlacing. This peculiar number resulted from color broadcasting needs, as it slightly altered the original 30 fps that had been standard for black and white television to maintain compatibility with existing monochrome broadcasts while allowing for hue and color information.

2. **PAL (Phase Alternating Line)**: Commonly used in most of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and some parts of South America, the PAL system worked at a frame rate of 25 fps, or 50 fields per second with interlacing. PAL was designed to improve color stability and was more resilient to color differences than NTSC, which was one of its significant advantages, especially for international broadcasts and video recording.

3. **SECAM (Sequential couleur à mémoire)**: Predominantly used in France, the former Soviet Union, and parts of Eastern Europe, SECAM also adhered to a 25 fps frame rate, similarly based on 50 fields per second with interlacing. Despite its similarity to PAL in terms of time-based frame rates, SECAM used a different method for color encoding, making it less compatible with PAL in terms of direct video compatibility without conversion.

These frame rates were largely influenced by the alternating current (AC) electricity frequency of 60 Hz in the Americas and Japan (for NTSC) and 50 Hz in most other countries (for PAL/SECAM), to minimize power line interference with television signals. The differences shaped the broadcast and video production landscapes significantly and affected international distribution of video content, making knowledge of these rates crucial for professionals in the industry during 1983.

Relevant context: The decline in iPod purchases began around 2008, a notable turning point in the device's sales trajectory. At this time, Apple was witnessing a shift in consumer preferences largely due to the introduction and rapid growth of their iPhone line, which consolidated multiple functionalities—music playing, internet browsing, and cellular communication—into a single device. 

Initially launched in 2001, the iPod quickly became a cultural icon and dominated the portable music player market throughout the early to mid-2000s. However, with the iPhone's release in 2007 and its subsequent models that offered robust music playing capabilities, the need for a separate music-only device was diminished. Consequently, as the iPhone gained popularity and enhanced features, iPod sales began to decrease steadily.

By the end of 2008, industry reports and Apple's sales data indicated a continuous decline in iPod units sold, a trend that persisted over the following years. This decline was also facilitated by the broader transition from dedicated devices to multifunctional smartphones, the increasing adoption of streaming services, and the overall technology convergence that rendered standalone digital music players less appealing to consumers. 

Therefore, while the iPod remained a beloved product for many and continued to see incremental releases and updates, its market significance was overshadowed by the smartphone era, marking 2008 as the beginning of its continuous decline in purchases.",291.0,1375.0,1723,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,4.32504940032959,0.9295492172241211,6.236740589141846,2009,1.0
"Although it had equipment capable of doing serious damage, the problem for the Luftwaffe was its unclear strategy and poor intelligence. OKL had not been informed that Britain was to be considered a potential opponent until early 1938. It had no time to gather reliable intelligence on Britain's industries. Moreover, OKL could not settle on an appropriate strategy. German planners had to decide whether the Luftwaffe should deliver the weight of its attacks against a specific segment of British industry such as aircraft factories, or against a system of interrelated industries such as Britain's import and distribution network, or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the British population. The Luftwaffe's strategy became increasingly aimless over the winter of 1940–1941. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it began.",What year did the OKL become aware that Britain would be a possible target?,early 1938,2,NUM,"What year did the OKL become aware that Britain would be a possible target?

Relevant context: In examining when the German High Command (OKL) became aware that Britain would be a potential target, we must delve into the period leading up to World War II. The OKL, or Oberkommando der Luftwaffe, was the high command of the German Air Force during the Nazi regime. Awareness of Britain as a possible target developed through a series of events and strategic deliberations in the 1930s.

A pivotal year in this context is 1936. This was a time of increasing tension and strategic planning within Germany, largely driven by Adolf Hitler's expansionist ambitions. The remilitarization of the Rhineland in March 1936 was a significant step that emboldened the German leadership to contemplate broader military actions, ultimately including Britain as a consideration.

Another crucial development was the release of the Four-Year Plan in 1936, aimed at preparing Germany for war within four years. This plan underscored the necessity of gearing military industries towards potential conflict scenarios that included Britain. In this year, the OKL began enhancing the capabilities of the Luftwaffe, an essential precondition for any military engagement with Britain, suggesting an awareness of Britain as a potential adversary.

Moreover, the Spanish Civil War, which began in 1936, served as a testing ground for the Luftwaffe's tactics and technology. The success of the German air force in this conflict likely reinforced the confidence of the OKL in its ability to conduct campaigns against more formidable foes, like Britain.

Thus, the awareness of Britain as a potential target by the OKL can be traced back to strategic considerations and military preparations made as early as 1936, though it would be in the years following—particularly after the Munich Agreement in 1938 and leading into the early stages of World War II—that this awareness would crystallize into concrete plans for military engagement.",394.0,1719.0,2174,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.824327707290649,1.1380927562713623,7.103872537612915,1938,0.8
"There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game.

Relevant context: The Laws of the Game are the set of codified rules that govern the sport of association football (commonly known as soccer). These laws are maintained and updated annually by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which is the body responsible for overseeing the rules of the game globally. 

As of the latest edition, there are 17 individual laws that collectively form the official Laws of the Game. Each law addresses specific aspects of the sport, ranging from the basic field dimensions to more complex regulations such as offside and fouls. Here is a brief overview of each law:

1. **The Field of Play** - This law outlines the required dimensions and markings of the football pitch.
2. **The Ball** - Details the specifications for the ball used in matches.
3. **The Players** - Specifies the number of players per team and the rules around substitutions.
4. **The Players' Equipment** - Covers the mandatory equipment that players must wear.
5. **The Referee** - Defines the authority and responsibilities of the referee.
6. **The Other Match Officials** - Describes the roles of assistant referees and other officials.
7. **The Duration of the Match** - Sets the length of a match and conditions for additional time.
8. **The Start and Restart of Play** - Details how matches start and how play is resumed after a stoppage.
9. **The Ball In and Out of Play** - Clarifies when the ball is considered in play or out of play.
10. **Determining the Outcome of a Match** - Outlines methods for determining a match result.
11. **Offside** - Provides guidance on what constitutes an offside position and infraction.
12. **Fouls and Misconduct** - Lists actions considered to be fouls and the corresponding sanctions.
13. **Free Kicks** - Differentiates between direct and indirect free kicks.
14. **The Penalty Kick** - Describes how penalty kicks are awarded and executed.
15. **The Throw-In** - Details the procedure for a throw-in.

"The origins of the HDI are found in the annual Development Reports of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq in 1990 and had the explicit purpose ""to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies"". To produce the Human Development Reports, Mahbub ul Haq formed a group of development economists including Paul Streeten, Frances Stewart, Gustav Ranis, Keith Griffin, Sudhir Anand, and Meghnad Desai. Working alongside Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, they worked on capabilities and functions that provided the underlying conceptual framework. Haq was sure that a simple composite measure of human development was needed in order to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being. Sen initially opposed this idea, but he soon went on to help Haq develop the Index. Sen was worried that it was going to be difficult to capture the full complexity of human capabilities in a single index, but Haq persuaded him that only a single number would shift the immediate attention of politicians from economic to human well-being.",Which year was used for estimates in the 2011 report?,1990,2,NUM,"Which year was used for estimates in the 2011 report?

Relevant context: In the comprehensive assessment presented in the 2011 report, the estimates are primarily based on data from the year 2009. Several factors contributed to selecting 2009 as the base year for estimates. Firstly, 2009 was the most recent year for which complete and reliable data were available at the time of the report's preparation. This allowed analysts to provide the most up-to-date assessments while ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

The report outlines that the choice of 2009 as the estimate year was crucial because it encompassed significant global economic events that impacted several sectors evaluated in the report. By grounding the estimates in 2009 data, the report aimed to capture a more accurate reflection of the market conditions, environmental factors, and socio-economic trends prevalent just before the decade began winding down. This approach also facilitated the comparison of trends over a span of multiple years leading up to the publication of the report in 2011.

Additionally, using 2009 as the baseline year enabled the inclusion of annual growth rate projections and trend analyses extending towards the mid-2010s, offering a more dynamic and forward-looking perspective for policymakers and researchers relying on the report's estimates.

Relevant context: As of September 2012, a total of 22 species had been delisted from the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) due to successful recovery efforts. This landmark achievement reflects decades of collaborative conservation actions undertaken by federal, state, and private agencies to restore these species to self-sustaining levels. Among the notable species that had been removed from the endangered list by this time were the bald eagle, the American alligator, and the gray wolf, each representing a unique conservation success story.

The bald eagle, for instance, was delisted in 2007, following remarkable recovery throughout its range in the contiguous United States. Intense conservation efforts included strict legal protections, habitat restoration, and public education campaigns that helped stabilize and increase eagle populations after the decline caused by hunting and DDT pesticide use. Similarly, the American alligator was delisted due to the combined effects of strong legal protections and the alligator's innate resilience, allowing it to rebound across its southeastern U.S. habitat.

These recovery stories underscore the ESA’s effectiveness in not only preventing the extinction of species but also facilitating their rebound to viable population levels where federal protection is no longer necessary. The delisting of a species, due to recovery, is a comprehensive, science-driven process that evaluates population size, threat status, and reproductive health to ensure that the species can sustain itself independently in the wild.

Cruisers in the U.S. Navy are designated as guided missile cruisers, which are heavily armed surface ships designed for multiple roles, including air defense, surface warfare, and anti-submarine warfare.

While the exact count of cruisers in the Third Fleet can vary over time due to deployment schedules and maintenance cycles, it generally consists of several Ticonderoga-class cruisers. This class, known for its Aegis Combat System, is integral to the fleet's ability to provide air defense and support carrier strike groups. A standard operational group within the Third Fleet might include two or three cruisers, each equipped with an array of missiles, gun systems, and other defense capabilities to support a range of missions.

Overall, while the exact number might change, such as during peacetime downgrades or wartime surges, a typical Third Fleet configuration would maintain a modest but significant number of cruisers, ensuring they remain a formidable force in Pacific maritime operations.",322.0,2088.0,2469,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,3.9654760360717773,1.21697998046875,6.122344732284546,17 cruisers,0.0
"During World War II, when Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany, the United States briefly controlled Greenland for battlefields and protection. In 1946, the United States offered to buy Greenland from Denmark for $100 million ($1.2 billion today) but Denmark refused to sell it. Several politicians and others have in recent years argued that Greenland could hypothetically be in a better financial situation as a part of the United States; for instance mentioned by professor Gudmundur Alfredsson at University of Akureyri in 2014. One of the actual reasons behind US interest in Greenland could be the vast natural resources of the island. According to Wikileaks, the U.S. appears to be highly interested in investing in the resource base of the island and in tapping the vast expected hydrocarbons off the Greenlandic coast.",How much did the US offer to pay for Greenland?,$100 million,2,NUM,"How much did the US offer to pay for Greenland?

Relevant context: In August 2019, a particularly notable event in international relations occurred when it was reported that President Donald Trump had expressed interest in the possibility of the United States purchasing Greenland from Denmark. The idea was not entirely unprecedented; the U.S. has shown interest in Greenland before, notably in 1946 when an offer of $100 million was made, though not accepted. 

However, in 2019, no formal financial offer was made. The interest was reportedly based on strategic and economic factors, with Greenland's valuable natural resources and its geopolitical significance in the Arctic being key attractions. President Trump's interest surfaced during discussions among White House advisers, and he later confirmed the idea publicly, describing it as ""essentially a large real estate deal.""

Though President Trump and his administration discussed the acquisition of Greenland, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen made it clear that Greenland was not for sale, dismissing the idea as ""absurd."" Greenland's government and its citizens also reiterated that they were not interested in being sold, emphasizing Greenland's autonomy and national pride.

In essence, while the concept of purchasing Greenland was brought to the public's attention in 2019, there was never an official offer detailing a specific sum of money made by the U.S. government to Denmark.

Relevant context: In the early 1970s, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) conducted an extensive study across multiple cities in the United States to evaluate the effectiveness of various crime reduction programs. The initiative aimed to understand the impact of federal funding on local law enforcement strategies and the overall crime rates in these urban areas. According to the comprehensive report published by the LEAA, 22 cities were included in the study, each implementing different tactics ranging from increased police presence to community engagement initiatives.

Of the 22 cities examined, 15 reported a measurable reduction in crime rates over the study period. Several factors were found to contribute to these decreases. Cities that experienced reductions often implemented multi-faceted approaches combining technological upgrades with community policing. Notably, cities like New York and Chicago saw significant improvements in certain categories of crime, such as property crime and burglary, potentially linked to the adoption of data-driven policing methods and enhanced community outreach programs.

However, it is important to note that the reductions were not uniformly spread across all categories of crime or all studied regions. Some cities experienced only modest declines or saw improvement in specific areas while others remained unchanged or even saw an increase in crime. The report emphasizes that while positive trends were observed in 15 cities, the overall success of crime reduction strategies heavily relied on the local context, the types of programs implemented, and the level of community involvement.

The LEAA study remains a critical reference point for understanding the early impact of federally supported crime reduction initiatives and highlights the complex dynamics involved in reducing crime in urban areas.

"Switzerland was the last Western republic to grant women the right to vote. Some Swiss cantons approved this in 1959, while at the federal level it was achieved in 1971 and, after resistance, in the last canton Appenzell Innerrhoden (one of only two remaining Landsgemeinde) in 1990. After obtaining suffrage at the federal level, women quickly rose in political significance, with the first woman on the seven member Federal Council executive being Elisabeth Kopp, who served from 1984–1989, and the first female president being Ruth Dreifuss in 1999.",When were Switzerland women granted the right to vote on a federal level?,1971,2,NUM,"When were Switzerland women granted the right to vote on a federal level?

Relevant context: Switzerland granted women the right to vote on a federal level relatively late compared to many other countries. The journey to achieving suffrage for Swiss women was long and complex, marked by numerous proposals and referendums before victory was finally secured. 

The pivotal moment came on February 7, 1971, when Swiss men voted in a national referendum to extend the right to vote to women. Remarkably, prior to this referendum, Swiss women had been denied the vote in federal elections, although some cantons had already granted women local voting rights. The result of the 1971 referendum was overwhelmingly positive, with 65.7% of male voters supporting the initiative, marking a historic change in Swiss political life. 

Before this, there had been multiple unsuccessful attempts to introduce women’s suffrage, with proposals being consistently rejected in referendums. For instance, an earlier national referendum in 1959 saw an overwhelming majority vote against it. However, shifts in social attitudes and increasing pressure from women’s rights movements, both domestically and internationally, contributed to the eventual success in 1971.

Interestingly, while Switzerland introduced federal women's suffrage in 1971, some cantons were slower to adopt full voting rights at the local level. The canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden, for instance, did not grant women the right to vote in cantonal elections until 1991 after being compelled by a Federal Court decision.

This change in 1971 placed Switzerland in line with other Western democracies but also highlighted its unique political system, where significant changes often require both national and local approval. The granting of voting rights to women was a crucial step towards gender equality in Switzerland, signifying a major societal transformation that has continued to evolve over the subsequent decades.",372.0,1707.0,2138,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.300909757614136,1.5409409999847412,6.786603689193726,1971,1.0

Relevant context: As of the most recent estimates, there are approximately 900 million dogs worldwide. This figure includes both domestic dogs, which are pets, and free-ranging or stray dogs, which do not have owners. The global dog population is broken down into various categories: pet dogs account for a substantial proportion, with millions found in homes across developed countries where they are kept for companionship, assistance, and security. 

In countries like the United States, it is estimated that there are around 90 million pet dogs. Meanwhile, developing countries often have larger populations of free-ranging or community dogs, which live on the streets or in rural areas where they may partially rely on human communities for food and suitable living conditions.

This impressive total reflects the widespread presence of dogs across the globe, inhabiting various environments from urban centers to rural areas. Dogs are among the most popular and versatile animals, and their numbers have steadily grown as human populations have increased and as dogs continue to adapt to diverse ecosystems.

Five main rail lines were cut in London and rolling stock damaged.",How many German bombers were shot down?,two,2,NUM,"How many German bombers were shot down?

Relevant context: The question of how many German bombers were shot down can be addressed by examining specific instances and overall statistics from World War II, particularly during key bombing campaigns. During the Battle of Britain alone, which took place from July to October 1940, the German Luftwaffe conducted extensive bombing raids against the United Kingdom. Historical records indicate that out of approximately 1,380 German bombers deployed during the battle, an estimated 600 were shot down by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and anti-aircraft defenses. 

The bombers primarily consisted of aircraft such as the Heinkel He 111, Dornier Do 17, and Junkers Ju 88. These losses were significant and had a profound impact on the Luftwaffe's ability to sustain prolonged bombing campaigns. RAF fighter pilots, flying planes like the Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane, played a crucial role in intercepting and destroying these German bombers.

Beyond the Battle of Britain, Allied forces continued to engage and shoot down German bombers throughout the war. During the Blitz, the intense German bombing campaign against London and other British cities from September 1940 to May 1941, many bombers were also lost to RAF night fighters and improved anti-aircraft measures.

It's important to note that comprehensive statistics for German bomber losses throughout the entirety of World War II vary due to differences in record-keeping and the chaotic nature of the war. However, studies estimate that thousands of German bombers were ultimately shot down by various Allied air forces over the course of the conflict, severely depleting the Luftwaffe's operational capacity by the war's end.

In summary, while exact numbers may vary depending on the specific campaign and time period, the loss of German bombers was a significant factor in the air war over Europe, heavily influenced by the effective strategies of the Allied air defenses and the valor of their pilots.",393.0,1801.0,2250,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.613062381744385,1.1868846416473389,6.956610918045044,38 German bombers,0.0

One key aspect of the FBI’s laboratory services is the accessibility of its resources. Many smaller agencies that lack specialized laboratory facilities rely on the FBI's capabilities, knowing that such assistance will come without an associated cost. However, while the services themselves are free, agencies receiving laboratory support must cover associated logistical expenses, such as evidence transportation to the FBI lab and any travel costs incurred if agency personnel need to collaborate directly with FBI specialists.

Additionally, the FBI maintains certain criteria and guidelines to ensure that the cases they support align with their national security priorities and overall mission. Requests for laboratory services may be prioritized based on factors such as the seriousness of the crime, potential threats to public safety, and the need for specialized forensic analyses that only the FBI can provide.

"The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a ""coalition of the willing"" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no ""smoking guns"". Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of ""major combat operations"" in the Iraq War. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a CNN–USA Today–Gallup poll. However, Bush's high approval ratings did not last. First, while the war itself was popular in the U.S., the reconstruction and attempted ""democratization"" of Iraq lost some support as months passed and casualty figures increased, with no decrease in violence nor progress toward stability or reconstruction. Second, as investigators combed through the country, they failed to find the predicted WMD stockpiles, which led to debate over the rationale for the war.","Did Bush have the support of the UN, when he decided to infiltrate Iraq on March 20, 2003?",without UN authorization,2,NUM,"Did Bush have the support of the UN, when he decided to infiltrate Iraq on March 20, 2003?

Relevant context: On March 20, 2003, the United States, under the leadership of President George W. Bush, initiated the invasion of Iraq. This military action marked the beginning of the Iraq War, which was part of a broader campaign known as the ""War on Terror."" A central question regarding this decision is whether President Bush had the support of the United Nations (UN) for the invasion.

In the lead-up to the invasion, the U.S. government argued that Iraq, led by President Saddam Hussein, possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and posed a significant threat to international security. The Bush administration also contended that Iraq had failed to comply with a series of UN Security Council resolutions, most notably Resolution 1441, which had been passed unanimously in November 2002. This resolution gave Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations under previous resolutions.

However, the situation regarding international support, particularly from the UN, was complex. While Resolution 1441 required Iraq to disarm and cooperate with UN weapons inspectors, it did not expressly authorize the use of force without further Security Council deliberation. The resolution indicated that ""serious consequences"" would follow if Iraq failed to comply, but there was a division within the Security Council about what those consequences should entail.

Leading up to the invasion, the U.S. sought a second resolution that would explicitly authorize military action against Iraq. This second resolution was strongly supported by the United Kingdom and some other allies, but it faced significant opposition from key Security Council members, including France, Russia, and China. These nations argued that diplomatic efforts and weapons inspections should continue and that the use of force was premature.

Ultimately, the U.S. did not secure a new resolution authorizing the invasion, and on March 19, 2003, President Bush announced the commencement of military operations without explicit UN approval. Many nations viewed the invasion as lacking legitimate authorization under international law, which led to widespread protests and criticism globally.

In summary, while the U.S. led coalition claimed the invasion was justified under existing UN resolutions, it did not have explicit support or authorization from the UN Security Council for the military intervention in Iraq. This lack of a specific UN mandate for the invasion was a significant point of contention and debate internationally.",488.0,2023.0,2580,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.5537497997283936,1.3795764446258545,7.278882026672363,No,0.0
"Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are required to create an Endangered Species Recovery Plan outlining the goals, tasks required, likely costs, and estimated timeline to recover endangered species (i.e., increase their numbers and improve their management to the point where they can be removed from the endangered list). The ESA does not specify when a recovery plan must be completed. The FWS has a policy specifying completion within three years of the species being listed, but the average time to completion is approximately six years. The annual rate of recovery plan completion increased steadily from the Ford administration (4) through Carter (9), Reagan (30), Bush I (44), and Clinton (72), but declined under Bush II (16 per year as of 9/1/06).",What is the average time of completion of an Endangered Species Recovery Plan?,approximately six years,2,NUM,"What is the average time of completion of an Endangered Species Recovery Plan?

Relevant context: The average time of completion for an Endangered Species Recovery Plan can vary significantly depending on a range of factors, including the complexity of the species' ecological needs, the degree of threat it faces, and the extent of stakeholder involvement. Recovery plans are essential processes endorsed by conservation agencies such as the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and play a critical role in guiding the recovery efforts for species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

Typically, the development of a recovery plan, from its initial stages to final publication, can range from two to five years. This timeframe includes several phases, such as initial data collection, public consultation, and the formal peer review process. However, completion times can sometimes extend beyond this range, particularly for species facing complex ecological threats or requiring coordinated efforts across multiple jurisdictions or agencies.

In general, a recovery plan begins with a comprehensive assessment of the species' current status, including its population trends, habitat requirements, and threats. Creating this assessment involves extensive field studies and collaboration with biologists, ecologists, and local stakeholders. Public involvement is also a crucial component, often requiring additional time for workshops and feedback sessions to ensure that the plan is both scientifically sound and publicly supported.

Once a draft plan is created, it undergoes a formal peer review by experts who provide objective critiques to ensure its effectiveness. These reviews can be time-intensive but are essential for ensuring that the plan adheres to best practices in conservation science. Following this, the plan is made available for public comment, another critical step that can add several months to the timeline, as feedback from this process must be reviewed and potentially integrated into the final plan.

After addressing public and scientific input, the recovery plan is finalized and officially published. Notably, the timeline from conception to completion can also be influenced by funding availability, political will, and unforeseen environmental changes that may necessitate plan revisions.

It is important to note that the completion of a recovery plan does not equate to the recovery of the species itself. Implementing a plan's strategies and achieving tangible recovery goals can take many years or even decades, depending on the species' reproductive rates, habitat restoration progress, and threat mitigation success.

While the timeframe for finalizing a recovery plan can be indicative of its thoroughness and the robustness of stakeholder engagement, it also reflects the often urgent and dynamic nature of conservation work, necessitating flexibility, adaptation, and sometimes, adjustments to evolving environmental conditions and scientific understanding.",512.0,1654.0,2226,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.130028009414673,6.869197368621826,14.182985305786133,Six years,0.8

"In recent years there was a high demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance but according to the CAP theorem it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide consistency, availability and partition tolerance guarantees. A distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time, but not all three. For that reason many NoSQL databases are using what is called eventual consistency to provide both availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency.",How many guarantees will most databases tolerate?,two,2,NUM,"How many guarantees will most databases tolerate?

Relevant context: Most modern databases are designed to handle guarantees related to data consistency, availability, and integrity, depending on the specific database system and its architecture. Generally, the concept of guarantees in databases becomes particularly relevant in the context of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties and the CAP theorem, which focuses on Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.

ACID guarantees are essential for transactional databases, which ensure that each transaction is processed reliably. Most relational databases, like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle, aim to provide robust ACID guarantees. They manage this through mechanisms like locks, isolation levels, and journaling to ensure that data remains consistent and transactions are both atomic (all parts succeed or fail as a unit) and durable (successful transactions are permanently recorded even in case of a system crash).

On the other hand, the CAP theorem informs the design of many NoSQL databases, where it's generally accepted that a distributed data store can't simultaneously provide all three of the guarantees concerning Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. Instead, database systems often have to sacrifice one to improve others. For example, Apache Cassandra aims for high availability and partition tolerance, trading off some consistency unless configured otherwise with techniques like eventual consistency or tunable consistency settings.

Most databases therefore don't have a fixed number of guarantees they will ""tolerate,"" as this isn't quite the right terminology. Rather, they strive to balance multiple guarantees out of necessity, influenced heavily by their architecture (whether they are centralized or distributed systems) and the design goals (transactional integrity versus scalability/flexibility). Understanding these balances can guide database administrators and developers in choosing the best database for their specific needs, tuning configurations to prioritize the guarantees that are most critical for their applications.

In summary, instead of asking how many guarantees databases tolerate, it's often more useful to consider which guarantees are prioritized and how they are implemented, given the trade-offs inherent in the database's design philosophy.",403.0,1525.0,1980,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.6874938011169434,1.3636531829833984,6.281508445739746,Two,1.0
"During World War II, San Diego became a major hub of military and defense activity, due to the presence of so many military installations and defense manufacturers. The city's population grew rapidly during and after World War II, more than doubling between 1930 (147,995) and 1950 (333,865). During the final months of the war, the Japanese had a plan to target multiple U.S. cities for biological attack, starting with San Diego. The plan was called ""Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night"" and called for kamikaze planes filled with fleas infected with plague (Yersinia pestis) to crash into civilian population centers in the city, hoping to spread plague in the city and effectively kill tens of thousands of civilians. The plan was scheduled to launch on September 22, 1945, but was not carried out because Japan surrendered five weeks earlier.",When did San Diego's population grow so rapidly that it nearly doubled?,during and after World War II,2,NUM,"When did San Diego's population grow so rapidly that it nearly doubled?

Relevant context: San Diego experienced a significant population boom during the mid-20th century. Specifically, the city's population nearly doubled between 1940 and 1960. This surge in growth can be attributed to several key factors. 

First, the post-World War II economic expansion played a crucial role. San Diego's military presence, heightened during the war, led to an influx of defense industry jobs. The U.S. Navy's continued investment in the area attracted workers and their families, spurring residential development.

Additionally, the establishment of high-tech industries and research institutions, such as General Dynamics and the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, further bolstered the local economy. These industries drew in educated professionals, contributing to the city's rapid population increase.

Infrastructure improvements, including the development of highways and the expansion of the San Diego International Airport, also made the city more accessible and appealing. The mild climate and scenic coastline further attracted new residents seeking a desirable living environment in southern California.

Consequently, San Diego's population grew from approximately 203,341 in 1940 to around 573,224 by 1960. This dramatic increase reflected the city's transformation into a major urban center and set the stage for its continued growth in the following decades.",266.0,1516.0,1842,1.0,0.25,0.43067655807339306,2.8155174255371094,1.232813835144043,5.254078388214111,World War II,0.5
"According to some estimates about 20% of the population lives on less than US$1.25 per day. Migration from Tajikistan and the consequent remittances have been unprecedented in their magnitude and economic impact.

Tajikistan has achieved transition from a planned to a market economy without substantial and protracted recourse to aid (of which it by now receives only negligible amounts), and by purely market-based means, simply by exporting its main commodity of comparative advantage — cheap labor. The World Bank Tajikistan Policy Note 2006 concludes that remittances have played an important role as one of the drivers of Tajikistan's robust economic growth during the past several years, have increased incomes, and as a result helped significantly reduce poverty.",What is the average amount lived on per day?,US$1.25 per day,2,NUM,"What is the average amount lived on per day?

Relevant context: When considering the question, ""What is the average amount lived on per day?"" it's important to understand the context in which this metric is being examined. Often, this inquiry relates to understanding the average daily cost of living for individuals or households in various regions around the world.

Several key factors influence the average daily living amount:

1. **Geographical Variations**: Different regions have vastly different costs of living, influenced by the local economy, price of goods and services, and purchasing power. In developed countries like the United States or Western Europe, the daily living expenses might range from $50 to $100 USD or more per person, taking into account food, transportation, housing, utilities, and other expenses.

2. **Living Standards**: The average amount lived on per day can also vary greatly depending on the standard of living. For instance, minimal living conditions in developing countries might involve daily costs of $1 to $5 USD, aligning with basic subsistence levels where individuals spend primarily on food and basic needs.

3. **Income Levels and Cost of Living Index**: The World Bank and other international organizations often assess poverty lines by considering the average amount people live on per day. For instance, they might classify those living on less than $3.20 per day as living in poverty in lower-middle-income countries.

4. **Household Composition and Economies of Scale**: An average per capita daily cost might also differ depending on the number of people sharing costs within a household. A larger household may benefit from economies of scale, reducing the average daily cost per person.

5. **Lifestyle Choices and Spending Patterns**: Individual lifestyle choices, such as dining out frequently or engaging in luxury activities, can significantly raise the daily amount one lives on. Conversely, frugal and minimalist lifestyles generally result in a lower average daily expenditure.

Ultimately, understanding the average daily living amount required involves a combination of these factors. Therefore, any reference to the average daily cost should specify the context, such as the location, socioeconomic group in question, and whether it refers to basic subsistence or a more comfortable lifestyle. This data can be essential for assessing economic well-being and planning personal or governmental budgets.",452.0,1579.0,2088,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.3881919384002686,1.2244954109191895,7.957443714141846,$1.25,0.5
"It is estimated that 5.5 million tonnes of uranium exists in ore reserves that are economically viable at US$59 per lb of uranium, while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources (reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction). Prices went from about $10/lb in May 2003 to $138/lb in July 2007. This has caused a big increase in spending on exploration, with US$200 million being spent worldwide in 2005, a 54% increase on the previous year. This trend continued through 2006, when expenditure on exploration rocketed to over $774 million, an increase of over 250% compared to 2004.

Relevant context: In May 2003, the price of uranium experienced notable fluctuations, reflecting broader trends in the energy market and geopolitical concerns. As of that month, the price of uranium was approximately $10.75 per pound. This value was consistent with the pricing trend of the early 2000s, a period characterized by relatively low uranium prices compared to subsequent years. The market for uranium at that time was influenced by limited demand from nuclear power facilities, many of which were operating on long-term contracts secured at stable prices.

Several factors contributed to the market conditions of uranium in 2003. The nuclear sector was still recovering from the aftermath of the Cold War, which resulted in significant stockpiles of uranium being released from decommissioned nuclear weapons. This oversupply, coupled with stagnant demand, kept prices low throughout the early 2000s.

However, by 2003, there were early signs of a shift in the energy landscape. Increasing global demand for electricity, coupled with a growing acknowledgment of the need for low-carbon energy sources, began to renew interest in nuclear power. This anticipated resurgence was expected to gradually tighten the uranium supply, with potential implications for future pricing. As such, May 2003 marked a period of transition, with stakeholders beginning to pay close attention to the potential for uranium price increases in the coming years.",285.0,1626.0,1971,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5530035495758057,2.118699789047241,6.881533622741699,$10,1.0
"General Electric switched to use the ASA scale in 1946. Meters manufactured since February 1946 were equipped with the ASA scale (labeled ""Exposure Index"") already. For some of the older meters with scales in ""Film Speed"" or ""Film Value"" (e.g. models DW-48, DW-49 as well as early DW-58 and GW-68 variants), replaceable hoods with ASA scales were available from the manufacturer. The company continued to publish recommended film values after that date, however, they were now aligned to the ASA scale.",How was the ASA scale shown on models built after 1946?,"labeled ""Exposure Index""",2,NUM,"How was the ASA scale shown on models built after 1946?

Relevant context: The ASA (American Standards Association) scale, which was the precursor to the current ISO scale, was widely incorporated into photographic equipment and film packaging following its formal adoption in the mid-20th century. In 1946, the ASA scale became a standard way to represent film speed—a measure of a film's sensitivity to light—using numerical ratings. 

On models built after 1946, this scale was typically displayed in several key places to guide photographers in selecting appropriate settings for various lighting conditions. For cameras, the ASA value was often indicated on the camera body, particularly near the film speed dial or selector. Many cameras had a dedicated ASA dial, allowing photographers to input the film speed rating, which in turn would adjust the camera's light meter calibration if it had one.

For film packaging, manufacturers prominently printed the ASA number on the film canister or the film box. This was crucial for ensuring that photographers set their camera to the correct ASA setting, maximizing the film's performance and ensuring proper exposure. The ASA scale was displayed numerically, with common values such as 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 representing the film's speed. These numbers directly corresponded to the sensitivity of the film; higher numbers indicated greater sensitivity and better performance in low-light conditions.

Additionally, on light meters developed post-1946, the ASA scale was often part of the input or calibration settings, enabling photographers to measure the intensity of light more accurately relative to the film speed they were using. 

Through these implementations, the ASA scale became an integral part of photographic practice, ingraining itself in the workflows of both amateur and professional photographers. This standardization helped bridge various components of photography—cameras, film, and light meters—under a common schema for measuring and utilizing film speed effectively.",381.0,1563.0,2003,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.921482563018799,2.633781671524048,11.836486339569092,Exposure Index,1.0
"Currently, the army is divided into the Regular Army, the Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. The army is also divided into major branches such as Air Defense Artillery, Infantry, Aviation, Signal Corps, Corps of Engineers, and Armor. Before 1903 members of the National Guard were considered state soldiers unless federalized (i.e., activated) by the President.

Relevant context: The Militia Act, also known as the Militia Act of 1862, was a significant piece of legislation passed by the United States Congress during the tumultuous period of the American Civil War. Enacted on July 17, 1862, this act granted President Abraham Lincoln the authority to call forth militias from the states to aid the Union Army in its efforts against the Confederacy. One of the critical aspects of the Militia Act was that it allowed for the enlistment of African American soldiers, marking a pivotal step towards the eventual formation of the United States Colored Troops. The act aimed to bolster Union forces by leveraging the manpower available in state militias while also addressing the urgent need for additional troops in light of ongoing military campaigns. The passage of the Militia Act of 1862 underscores the federal government’s growing reliance on broader inclusivity and resource mobilization strategies to achieve victory in the Civil War.

"As anticipated by Nimitz, the Japanese fleet arrived off Midway on 4 June and was spotted by PBY patrol aircraft. Nagumo executed a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his aircraft, bound for Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20 the first U.S. carrier aircraft arrived, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; thanks in part to faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to score a single hit and all 15 were wiped out by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, 15 additional TBDs from Enterprise attacked in which 14 were lost, again with no hits. Thus far, Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly ineffectual, but they succeeded in drawing Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repulsing the two waves of torpedo bombers. As a result, when U.S. dive bombers arrived at high altitude, the Zeros were poorly positioned to defend. To make matters worse, Nagumo's four carriers had drifted out of formation in their efforts to avoid torpedoes, reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft fire. Nagumo's indecision had also created confusion aboard his carriers. Alerted to the need of a second strike on Midway, but also wary of the need to deal with the American carriers that he now knew were in the vicinity, Nagumo twice changed the arming orders for his aircraft. As a result, the American dive bombers found the Japanese carriers with their decks cluttered with munitions as the crews worked hastily to properly re-arm their air groups.",When did the Japanese fleet arrive off Midway?,4 June,2,NUM,"When did the Japanese fleet arrive off Midway?

Relevant context: The Japanese fleet arrived off Midway Atoll in the early morning hours of June 4, 1942, marking the beginning of what would become the pivotal Battle of Midway during World War II. Under the command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the Japanese operation aimed to eliminate the United States as a strategic power in the Pacific, thereby securing Japan's dominance in the region.

The fleet, consisting of four aircraft carriers—Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, and Hiryu—as well as numerous battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, approached Midway from the northwest. The arrival time coincided with the first light, as the Japanese intended to launch a surprise attack, similar to their strategy at Pearl Harbor. However, U.S. cryptanalysts had broken Japanese communication codes, allowing the United States Navy to anticipate and prepare for the assault.

Japanese aircraft began launching from their carriers shortly after their arrival, intending to soften the defenses on Midway before invading. Despite their early success in damaging parts of the Midway base, U.S. forces were ready. American aircraft from Midway, along with carrier-based planes from USS Enterprise, USS Hornet, and the newly-repaired USS Yorktown, launched a counteroffensive that ultimately led to a turning point in the war.

Relevant context: FGM stands for Female Genital Mutilation. It refers to all procedures involving the partial or total removal of external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women. The practice is mostly carried out on young girls between infancy and age 15. 

FGM is divided into four major types: 

1. **Clitoridectomy**: Partial or total removal of the clitoris.
2. **Excision**: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora.
3. **Infibulation**: Narrowing of the vaginal opening by creating a covering seal, formed by cutting and repositioning the labia.
4. **Other Harmful Procedures**: All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, such as pricking, piercing, incising, scraping, and cauterizing.

FGM is practiced for various reasons, often rooted in cultural, religious, or social factors within families and communities. Despite being illegal in many countries, it persists due to these entrenched beliefs and is often regarded as a rite of passage or a necessary preparation for marriage. 

Health consequences of FGM can be severe and long-lasting, including chronic pain, infections, increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths, as well as psychological trauma.

Efforts to eliminate FGM have been ongoing worldwide, with the United Nations, World Health Organization, and various human rights groups actively working to raise awareness, implement stronger legislation, and provide support to affected individuals.

In addition to religious gatherings held in churches and temples, the LDS Church is known for its youth programs, seminary and institute classes for religious education, and a lay clergy system, where church members volunteer their time to fulfill various leadership and service roles.

The church's organizational structure is highly unified and hierarchical, with a President, who is regarded as a prophet, seer, and revelator, at the helm, supported by two counselors, together comprising the First Presidency. This governance is further backed by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, General Authorities, and local leaders who guide thousands of congregations worldwide.

This index is a key economic indicator that measures the degree of optimism or pessimism that consumers feel about the overall state of the economy and their personal financial situation. The Consumer Confidence Index is typically published on a regular basis, such as monthly or quarterly, by organizations like The Conference Board in the United States. It plays a crucial role in economic forecasting and policy-making, as high consumer confidence generally correlates with increased spending and economic growth, while low confidence suggests consumers might save more and spend less.

Another well-known meaning of CCI is the ""Competition Commission of India."" This is a statutory body established by the Government of India to enforce the Competition Act, 2002, and to prevent activities that have an adverse effect on competition in the country. The CCI's role is to promote and sustain competition in the markets, protect the interests of consumers, and ensure freedom of trade.

"During Victoria's first pregnancy in 1840, in the first few months of the marriage, 18-year-old Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother. Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot. He was tried for high treason and found guilty, but was acquitted on the grounds of insanity. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis. Her daughter, also named Victoria, was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen hated being pregnant, viewed breast-feeding with disgust, and thought newborn babies were ugly. Nevertheless, over the following seventeen years, she and Albert had a further eight children: Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (b. 1841), Alice (b. 1843), Alfred (b. 1844), Helena (b. 1846), Louise (b. 1848), Arthur (b. 1850), Leopold (b. 1853) and Beatrice (b. 1857).",What happened to Edward Oxford to after he was found guilty of high treason?,acquitted on the grounds of insanity,3,DESC,"What happened to Edward Oxford to after he was found guilty of high treason?

Relevant context: Edward Oxford, a young man in his late teens, became a notorious figure in 1840 when he attempted to assassinate Queen Victoria. After his arrest, Oxford was tried for high treason at the Old Bailey. The trial commenced in July 1840 and attracted significant public and media attention, given the gravity of the crime against the young Queen.

At trial, evidence was presented that Oxford had fired a pistol at the Queen while she was in her carriage, though no bullets actually struck her. The most pivotal point of the trial came when it was revealed that Oxford's firearms did not contain live ammunition, raising doubts about his intent and capability to carry out the assassination.

The defense argued that Oxford was insane, a claim supported by his erratic behavior and family reports of mental illness. Medical experts testified about his mental state, suggesting that he suffered from delusions and was not fully aware of the nature or consequences of his actions.

Ultimately, the jury accepted the defense of insanity, a relatively novel legal concept at the time, and thus found Edward Oxford “not guilty on the grounds of insanity.” As a result, he was not sentenced to the death penalty, as was customary for treason, but was instead detained indefinitely at the state's pleasure. This effectively meant he was committed to an asylum for the criminally insane.

Oxford was initially sent to the State Criminal Lunatic Asylum at Bethlem (commonly known as Bedlam), where he spent several years under strict supervision. Following this, he was transferred to Broadmoor Hospital, a newly established facility designed specifically for long-term care of mentally ill offenders.

Despite his confinement, Oxford's behavior and mental state reportedly improved over time. His conduct in the institution was described as exemplary, and he engaged in various activities and studies, gaining a reputation for industriousness and good temper.

In 1867, after 27 years of confinement, Oxford was released on the condition of permanent exile from Britain. He relocated to Australia, where he assumed a new identity, John Freeman. In his new life, he adapted well, finding employment as a painter and writer, and even pursuing a career as a stage actor. Oxford led a relatively quiet and uneventful life there until his death in 1900, leaving a legacy as one of history’s most intriguing yet obscure figures who once posed a threat to the British monarchy.",495.0,2050.0,2607,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.95806097984314,0.8927958011627197,10.898918628692627,Acquitted,0.5

The protesters were voicing their opposition to a newly approved development project that planned to replace a significant portion of Greenfield Park, a beloved local natural area, with commercial and residential buildings. The demonstration had been organized by the Greenfield Environmental Alliance (GEA), a local advocacy group known for its commitment to preserving natural spaces.

Despite initially peaceful intentions, tensions escalated when the protesters began blocking access to the courthouse. According to eyewitness accounts and police reports, the protesters formed a human chain, linking arms and sitting down in front of the main entrance, effectively preventing employees and the public from entering the building. This blockade occurred around 9:00 AM, during the courthouse’s busiest hours, leading to significant disruption of its operations.

Law enforcement officials on the scene repeatedly requested that the protesters disperse and allow access to the courthouse. When these verbal appeals were ignored, and after an hour of continued obstruction, the Greenfield Police Department declared the protest unlawful under local ordinances prohibiting obstruction of public buildings and thoroughfares. The police issued a final warning before proceeding with arrests.

Ultimately, 23 protesters were arrested for failing to comply with dispersal orders and for obstructing access to a public building. Those arrested were charged primarily with misdemeanor offenses, including unlawful assembly and obstruction of justice.

Relevant context: Tucson, located in the state of Arizona, has a climate classified as a hot semi-arid climate, which is categorized as ""BSh"" according to the Köppen climate classification system. This classification indicates that the region experiences hot temperatures and receives limited precipitation, characteristic of semi-arid environments. Tucson's climate is defined by its distinct seasons that are typical of the Sonoran Desert region.

Summers in Tucson are long, extremely hot, and mostly clear, with temperatures frequently climbing above 100°F (38°C) during June, July, and August. The intense heat is often tempered by the onset of the North American Monsoon. The monsoon typically arrives in early July and continues until early September, bringing short-lived but intense thunderstorms that can deliver significant precipitation in a short period. While these storms provide crucial moisture relief from the summer heat, they can also lead to flash flooding and localized severe weather events.

Winters in Tucson are mild with cooler temperatures and more cloud cover than summer. Average daytime highs in January, the coolest month, range from 60 to 70°F (15 to 21°C), while nighttime lows can drop to around 40°F (4°C) or lower. Snow is exceptionally rare, occurring only under unusual conditions. However, the nearby Santa Catalina Mountains, just outside the city, can receive snow, offering a stark contrast to the desert floor.

Spring and fall are transitional seasons characterized by mild temperatures and relatively low precipitation. Spring can start as early as February, with blossoms appearing and temperatures gradually warming from the winter lows. Fall, which typically begins in late September to early October, brings relief from the summer's intense heat with decreasing temperatures and a retreat of monsoon activity.

Tucson receives an average annual precipitation of about 12 inches (300 mm).

"Fog is fairly common, particularly in spring and early summer, and the occasional tropical storm or hurricane can threaten the region, especially in late summer and early autumn. Due to its situation along the North Atlantic, the city often receives sea breezes, especially in the late spring, when water temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be more than 20 °F (11 °C) colder than a few miles inland, sometimes dropping by that amount near midday. Thunderstorms occur from May to September, that are occasionally severe with large hail, damaging winds and heavy downpours. Although downtown Boston has never been struck by a violent tornado, the city itself has experienced many tornado warnings. Damaging storms are more common to areas north, west, and northwest of the city. Boston has a relatively sunny climate for a coastal city at its latitude, averaging over 2,600 hours of sunshine per annum.",What months do thunderstorms occur in Boston?,May to September,3,DESC,"What months do thunderstorms occur in Boston?

Relevant context: Thunderstorms in Boston can occur throughout much of the year, but they are most common during the warmer months, particularly from late spring to early fall. Generally, the thunderstorm season in Boston begins in May and lasts through September. During these months, the combination of warmer temperatures and increased humidity creates favorable conditions for thunderstorm development. 

In May, thunderstorms start to become more frequent as temperatures rise, marking the beginning of Boston's prime season for such weather events. June and July typically see the highest frequency of thunderstorms in the city. These storms often coincide with hot, humid conditions typical of summer weather in the northeastern United States. 

August also sees a significant number of thunderstorms, as the heat and humidity remain prominent. By September, the occurrence of thunderstorms begins to taper off, though it is still possible for early fall storms to happen, especially early in the month. 

It is relatively uncommon for thunderstorms to occur in Boston during the winter months from November through March. During these months, the weather is generally too cold and less conducive to the atmospheric instability needed for thunderstorms. 

Overall, while thunderstorms can happen at any time of year, those interested in tracking or studying thunderstorm activity in Boston should primarily focus on the period from May through September. This timeframe captures the peak of thunderstorm activity, offering the best chance to observe and experience such weather phenomena in the area.",286.0,1944.0,2284,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.479506254196167,1.1840002536773682,5.781979084014893,May to September,1.0
"Temperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent Puget Sound, greater Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington. The region is largely shielded from Pacific storms by the Olympic Mountains and from Arctic air by the Cascade Range. Despite being on the margin of the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains, the city has a reputation for frequent rain. This reputation stems from the frequency of light precipitation in the fall, winter, and spring. In an average year, at least 0.01 inches (0.25 mm) of precipitation falls on 150 days, more than nearly all U.S. cities east of the Rocky Mountains. It is cloudy 201 days out of the year and partly cloudy 93 days. Official weather and climatic data is collected at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, located about 19 km (12 mi) south of downtown in the city of SeaTac, which is at a higher elevation, and records more cloudy days and fewer partly cloudy days per year.",What land mass protects Seattle from Pacific caused weather?,Olympic Mountains,3,DESC,"What land mass protects Seattle from Pacific caused weather?

Relevant context: Seattle, situated in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, is uniquely nestled between significant geographic features that influence its weather patterns. A key land mass that protects Seattle from the direct impact of Pacific Ocean weather systems is the Olympic Peninsula. This peninsula is home to the Olympic Mountains, a rugged mountain range that acts as a formidable barrier to incoming Pacific weather fronts.

When moist air masses travel eastward from the Pacific Ocean, they encounter the Olympic Mountains first. As the air is forced to rise over these mountains, it cools and releases much of its moisture in the form of precipitation, primarily as rain. This process is known as orographic lift. Consequently, the western slopes of the Olympic Mountains receive significant rainfall, resulting in lush temperate rainforests in this area.

By the time these weather systems move past the Olympic Mountains and reach the Puget Sound region, where Seattle is located, they have lost much of their moisture. This rain shadow effect means that Seattle experiences less precipitation than the Olympic Peninsula and is shielded from the most extreme weather conditions coming off the Pacific. While Seattle is famous for its rainy reputation, it actually receives less annual rainfall than many might expect, partly due to this natural barrier.

In summary, the Olympic Peninsula and its mountainous terrain act as a critical geographic feature that mitigates the impact of Pacific Ocean-driven weather on Seattle, creating a rain shadow effect that protects the city from the heavier rains that fall on the windward side of the Olympics.",309.0,1720.0,2085,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.713026285171509,1.0868785381317139,6.794504642486572,Olympic Mountains,1.0

At present the region is home to 14 million people and has 120 million annual visitors.",What is the dominant industry in the Alpine region? ,tourist industry,3,DESC,"What is the dominant industry in the Alpine region? 

Relevant context: The Alpine region, spanning across countries such as Austria, Switzerland, France, Italy, Germany, Slovenia, and Liechtenstein, is renowned for its stunning mountainous landscapes and diverse economic activities. While several industries are prevalent in this area, tourism emerges as the dominant industry, largely due to the unique geographical features and cultural offerings of the region.

Tourism in the Alpine region, particularly during the winter and summer seasons, plays a crucial economic role. The Alps are famous for their winter sports facilities, attracting millions of tourists annually. Skiing and snowboarding are particularly popular, with world-class resorts like Chamonix in France, St. Moritz in Switzerland, and Kitzbühel in Austria serving as key destinations. These resorts not only offer pristine ski slopes but also provide an array of complementary services such as luxury accommodations, fine dining, and wellness centers, catering to both domestic and international tourists.

Summer tourism is also significant, as visitors are drawn to activities like hiking, mountain biking, and climbing. The summer months showcase the region's breathtaking scenery, with verdant valleys and clear alpine lakes. The longstanding tradition of hosting events, such as the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, further complements the tourism industry's influence by drawing cultural tourism to the area.

Additionally, the Alpine region is deeply committed to sustainable tourism practices, placing a strong emphasis on preserving its natural environment while supporting local communities. Investments in eco-friendly infrastructure and initiatives to minimize environmental impacts are a testament to this commitment.

Outside of tourism, the Alpine region also supports industries such as agriculture—most notably dairy farming and cheese production—as well as hydroelectric power generation. These industries contribute to the regional economy but do not overshadow the pervasive influence of tourism, which remains the foremost economic driver.

"The governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division.",What do teams gain for doing well throughout the season?,points,3,DESC,"What do teams gain for doing well throughout the season?

Relevant context: When sports teams perform well throughout a season, they can gain a variety of rewards and advantages, both tangible and intangible, which often vary depending on the sport and league in question. 

One of the primary benefits is qualifying for postseason play. In many sports leagues, such as the NBA, NFL, MLB, and European soccer leagues, a strong performance during the regular season secures a team a spot in the playoffs or knockout stages. This provides an opportunity for the team to compete for the championship title. Playoff qualification is often a key motivator, as it can also bring additional revenue from ticket sales, merchandise, and broadcasting rights.

Securing a high seeding is another crucial advantage. In leagues with playoff systems, such as the NBA and NHL, teams with better season records often receive higher seeds, which can provide more favorable matchups in the initial rounds of the playoffs. Higher-seeded teams may also enjoy home-field or home-court advantage, meaning they play more games at their home venue, where they typically have a better chance of winning due to familiar surroundings and supportive crowds.

Financial incentives play a notable role as well. Teams that perform well might receive prize money, increased sponsorship deals, or bonuses. In European soccer leagues, such as the English Premier League, clubs that finish higher in the standings receive more significant shares of television revenue, which can substantially impact their financial health and investment in future talent.

Furthermore, individual player accolades and team recognition are also at stake. Players on successful teams have a higher likelihood of being acknowledged with awards such as Most Valuable Player (MVP), All-Star selections, or other league honors. Teams that perform well are often celebrated by their fans and gain increased media attention, which enhances their brand visibility and can attract more fans globally.

Lastly, maintaining a winning culture and morale within the team and its fanbase is an important intangible benefit. Success breeds a positive environment for both players and fans, fostering loyalty and enthusiasm that can support sustained performance over time. This strong team identity and culture are invaluable assets that contribute to a team's long-term success.

Relevant context: Castello a Mare, situated in Palermo, Sicily, served both defensive and administrative functions during its extensive history. Constructed between the Norman period and the 16th century, this formidable fortress was strategically positioned at the mouth of Palermo's harbor, effectively controlling maritime access to the city. Its primary purpose was to defend the city against both seaborne and inland attacks, reflecting its importance in the broader geopolitical landscape of the Mediterranean region. 

The fortification's design evolved over centuries, incorporating elements such as massive walls, watchtowers, and artillery platforms, indicative of its role in adapting to advancements in military technology and changing threats. Besides its military uses, Castello a Mare also housed administrative offices and served as the residence of key officials, integrating governance with defense. 

Moreover, the site played a significant part in the economic sphere, as it protected the bustling port through which goods flowed, making Palermo a vital commercial hub. Throughout its history, control of the Castello a Mare was seen as synonymous with control over the city itself, underscoring its integral role in Palermo's social and political fabric.

The central element of this attraction is a simulated free-fall achieved through the use of a high-speed elevator system. For safety reasons, passengers are seated and secured in their seats rather than standing. Unlike most traction elevators, the elevator car and counterweight are joined using a rail system in a continuous loop running through both the top and the bottom of the drop shaft. This allows the drive motor to pull down on the elevator car from underneath, resulting in downward acceleration greater than that of normal gravity. The high-speed drive motor is used to rapidly lift the elevator as well.",Do ride goers stand or sit?,passengers are seated and secured in their seats rather than standing,3,DESC,"Do ride goers stand or sit?

Relevant context: When attending amusement parks, fairs, or similar recreational venues, ride goers typically have the option to either stand or sit, depending on the type of ride they choose. Many traditional rides, such as roller coasters, Ferris wheels, and carousels, are designed with seats that include safety restraints like lap bars, seat belts, or harnesses to secure passengers during the ride. These seated rides offer a range of experiences, from gentle spins on a merry-go-round to the thrilling drops and loops of a roller coaster.

On the other hand, some rides are specifically designed to be experienced while standing. One example of a standing ride is the stand-up roller coaster. This variation of the traditional roller coaster allows riders to stand upright, secured by special harnesses and restraints, offering a unique perspective and sensation as the ride traverses its track. Another example is certain spinning rides and attraction simulators, which might require riders to stand while being enclosed in a safety enclosure that allows for greater movement.

The choice between standing or sitting on a ride can also be influenced by local safety regulations, the age and physical condition of the rider, and personal preference. Ride operators typically provide instructions and guidance on how to position oneself appropriately and will ensure that all safety measures are in place before the ride begins. Ultimately, whether ride goers stand or sit can greatly depend on the specific ride, its design, and safety requirements, all of which contribute to the overall experience and enjoyment of the attraction.",308.0,1275.0,1635,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.950157880783081,1.0395114421844482,7.165470361709595,Sit,0.0
"People lived on the edge of the desert thousands of years ago since the last ice age. The Sahara was then a much wetter place than it is today. Over 30,000 petroglyphs of river animals such as crocodiles survive, with half found in the Tassili n'Ajjer in southeast Algeria. Fossils of dinosaurs, including Afrovenator, Jobaria and Ouranosaurus, have also been found here. The modern Sahara, though, is not lush in vegetation, except in the Nile Valley, at a few oases, and in the northern highlands, where Mediterranean plants such as the olive tree are found to grow. It was long believed that the region had been this way since about 1600 BCE, after shifts in the Earth's axis increased temperatures and decreased precipitation. However, this theory has recently been called into dispute, when samples taken from several 7 million year old sand deposits led scientists to reconsider the timeline for desertification.",What is believed to have increased temperatures in the   Sahara?,shifts in the Earth's axis,3,DESC,"What is believed to have increased temperatures in the   Sahara?

Relevant context: The Sahara Desert, known for its vast stretches of arid landscapes, has experienced a noticeable increase in temperatures over recent decades. Scientists and climatologists have identified multiple factors that contribute to this warming trend. One of the primary culprits is climate change driven by human activities, particularly the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global temperature rises, including those observed in the Sahara.

Another significant factor is land use change, particularly overgrazing and deforestation. These activities can disrupt the natural vegetation cover, which plays a critical role in regulating temperature and maintaining soil moisture. The loss of vegetation leads to more heat being absorbed by the ground, further elevating temperatures.

Moreover, there is a complex interplay between the regional weather patterns and the warming ocean temperatures. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, for instance, influences rainfall patterns and could contribute to periods of warming by altering the Sahara's climate systems. This oscillation, combined with warming sea surface temperatures, can lead to shifts in the atmospheric circulation patterns that impact the desert climate.

Additionally, feedback loops such as the albedo effect also exacerbate warming. As the desert's surface darkens due to the loss of reflective sand and dust particles or changes in surface cover, it absorbs more heat, thus increasing temperatures further.

In summary, while natural climate variability does play a role, the predominant belief among experts is that human-induced factors such as increased greenhouse gas emissions, land use changes, and intricate feedback mechanisms are key drivers of the rising temperatures in the Sahara Desert. These insights are crucial for devising strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change in this and other vulnerable regions worldwide.",351.0,1978.0,2387,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.019313335418701,1.7671313285827637,6.925111293792725,Sinking air,0.0
"Mexico City is located in the Valley of Mexico, sometimes called the Basin of Mexico. This valley is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the high plateaus of south-central Mexico. It has a minimum altitude of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000 metres (16,000 feet). This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.",Why is Mexico City vulnerable to flooding?,no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides,3,DESC,"Why is Mexico City vulnerable to flooding?

Relevant context: Mexico City is particularly vulnerable to flooding due to a combination of geographical, historical, and urban planning factors. Geographically, the city is situated in a massive basin known as the Valley of Mexico, which is encircled by mountains. Historically, this area was once covered by a series of lakes, with the Aztecs famously establishing their capital, Tenochtitlán, on an island in the largest of these lakes. Over centuries, the Spanish and later the local government drained these lakes to accommodate urban growth, but this has had long-lasting implications on the land's ability to manage water.

One key reason for the city's susceptibility to flooding is its terrain. Much of Mexico City is built on soft, water-saturated clay and volcanic soils which are prone to subsidence. As the city expands, the weight of buildings combined with the extraction of groundwater causes the land to sink, a phenomenon known as subsidence. This exacerbates the risk of flooding because it disrupts the city's drainage systems and can lead to significant pooling of water during heavy rains.

Another major factor is the climate. Mexico City experiences a rainy season from May to October, during which intense rainfall events are common. The city's stormwater infrastructure, which is often outdated and inadequate for the current population of over 21 million people in the metropolitan area, struggles to manage the deluge during these times. Additionally, rapid urbanization has led to an increase in impermeable surfaces such as roads and pavements, which prevent water from naturally soaking into the ground, further overloading the drainage system.

Moreover, climate change has amplified the frequency and intensity of weather events, including heavy rainfalls, making extreme flooding events more likely. This has been compounded by deforestation in the surrounding areas which reduces natural water absorption and increases runoff.

Overall, the combination of historical lake drainage, subsidence due to soil composition and groundwater extraction, inadequate urban infrastructure, climate change challenges, and the natural basin-like geography contribute to Mexico City's vulnerability to flooding. These factors together underscore the city's unique challenges in managing flood risks, necessitating comprehensive urban planning and enhanced disaster resilience strategies.",434.0,1470.0,1958,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,7.218677759170532,1.0797042846679688,9.266993284225464,No natural drainage,0.8
"After the American Revolutionary War, the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the North and the South as slaves were freed. Most northern states abolished slavery, sometimes, like New York, in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed. The last slaves in New York were not freed until 1827. In connection with the Second Great Awakening, Quaker and Methodist preachers in the South urged slaveholders to free their slaves. Revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves, some by deed and others by will, so that from 1782 to 1810, the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the South.",What caused many men to free slaves from 1782 to 1810?,Revolutionary ideals,3,DESC,"What caused many men to free slaves from 1782 to 1810?

Relevant context: Between 1782 and 1810, a combination of evolving moral, economic, and legal factors led many men to free slaves in the United States and other parts of the world where slavery was still prevalent. One of the primary moral influences was the growing movement heralded by Enlightenment ideals, which emphasized liberty, equality, and human rights. These principles inspired prominent intellectuals and religious groups, such as the Quakers and Methodists, to vocally oppose slavery and promote abolition.

In addition to moral and philosophical shifts, economic changes played a significant role. The American Revolutionary War and the subsequent independence of the United States in 1783 spurred a reevaluation of labor systems. Initially, many landowners realized that the war had disrupted the agricultural economy, making it less cost-effective to maintain slave labor. The gradual end of the transatlantic slave trade also influenced some slaveholders. By 1807, Britain had abolished the trade, and the United States followed suit in 1808, making the acquisition of new slaves more difficult and costly, which contributed to a reconsideration of the slave-based economy.

Legal changes further encouraged manumission. In 1782, Virginia passed a law that made it easier for individuals to emancipate their slaves, a move mirrored by other states over the subsequent years. These legal adjustments provided a framework for owners who were inclined to release their slaves but faced numerous bureaucratic obstacles. Additionally, the emergence of free African American communities and the establishment of institutions like the Pennsylvania Abolition Society provided support and advocacy for enslaved people seeking freedom.

The era also saw a notable increase in the number of manumissions in the upper South and Northern states. In the North, the gradual abolition of slavery was already underway. States such as Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York passed laws that initiated the gradual emancipation of slaves. This regional comparison highlighted the growing moral divide within the United States and reinforced the idea that slavery was inconsistent with the newly founded nation's ideals of freedom and democracy.

The influence of successful self-emancipated individuals was also significant. Leaders like Olaudah Equiano and other former slaves wrote powerful narratives detailing the horrors of slavery while advocating for its abolition, providing firsthand accounts that were difficult to ignore.

While the period between 1782 and 1810 was not characterized by widespread abolition, these interconnected moral, economic, and legislative factors fostered a climate in which many men chose to free slaves, setting the stage for the broader abolitionist movements that gained momentum in the ensuing decades.",526.0,1818.0,2407,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.113732576370239,1.0012400150299072,9.06468677520752,Revolutionary ideals,1.0

Relevant context: In Dutch, the term for ""Peasant Wedding"" is ""Boerenbruiloft."" This phrase is composed of two Dutch words: ""boeren,"" which means ""peasant"" or ""farmer,"" and ""bruiloft,"" which translates to ""wedding."" Commonly, the word ""boer"" is used in the Netherlands to refer to farmers or agrarian workers, and ""bruiloft"" is the standard term for a wedding ceremony, much like in English.

The concept of a ""Boerenbruiloft"" is often associated with traditional and historical Dutch festivities, where communities would celebrate nuptials with rustic charm, reflecting rural customs. Historical depictions of peasant weddings, such as those captured in the famed painting ""The Peasant Wedding"" by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, provide a vivid tableau of these celebrations, showcasing the communal joy and simplicity typical of rural life.

Understanding translations like ""Boerenbruiloft"" can be particularly interesting because it provides insight not only into the language itself but also into cultural practices and historical contexts.

"The so-called ""Sack of Palermo"" is one of the major visible faces of the problem. The term is used to indicate the speculative building practices that have filled the city with poor buildings. The reduced importance of agriculture in the Sicilian economy has led to a massive migration to the cities, especially Palermo, which swelled in size, leading to rapid expansion towards the north. The regulatory plans for expansion was largely ignored in the boom. New parts of town appeared almost out of nowhere, but without parks, schools, public buildings, proper roads and the other amenities that characterise a modern city.",Why did Palermo substancially grow in size?,reduced importance of agriculture in the Sicilian economy has led to a massive migration to the cities,3,DESC,"Why did Palermo substancially grow in size?

Relevant context: Palermo, the capital of the Italian island of Sicily, experienced substantial growth in size due to a combination of historical, economic, and social factors. One of the key periods of expansion occurred during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, corresponding with the unification of Italy and the subsequent economic developments. 

After the unification, Palermo, like many other Italian cities, underwent significant urbanization. The city expanded beyond its ancient walls to accommodate a burgeoning population, driven in part by rural-to-urban migration. People from surrounding villages and rural areas moved to Palermo in search of better economic opportunities as the city industrialized and diversified its economy. This led to the development of new residential areas, commercial districts, and improved infrastructure to support the growing urban population.

Industrial advancements played a crucial role, with the establishment of new industries in sectors such as shipbuilding, textiles, and food processing. The port of Palermo became a critical hub for trade in the Mediterranean, further boosting the city's economy and attracting new residents. This economic growth also spurred investment in real estate and public works, leading to the construction of new housing, roads, and public buildings.

During the mid-20th century, after the devastation of World War II, Palermo underwent another phase of growth. The post-war economic boom saw significant investment in the reconstruction and modernization of the city's infrastructure. The government implemented extensive housing projects to accommodate the influx of people, further expanding the city's boundaries. The introduction and expansion of transportation networks, including a more extensive road and rail system, facilitated easier commuter access and supported urban sprawl into the surrounding countryside.

Moreover, the post-war era saw an increase in tourism, with Palermo becoming a popular destination due to its rich history, cultural heritage, and mild climate. This influx of tourists prompted further development and expansion of hospitality and service sectors, contributing to the city's growth.

In summary, Palermo's substantial growth can be attributed to historical unification and industrialization efforts, rural-to-urban migration, strategic economic positioning as a trade hub, post-World War II reconstruction and modernization initiatives, and the development of tourism sectors. These factors combined to expand not only the city's physical size but also its economic and social framework, making Palermo a vibrant and populous urban center in the Mediterranean region.",470.0,1781.0,2305,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.22723913192749,1.1114933490753174,7.324042558670044,Migration,0.5

Relevant context: Bermuda's decision to join the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) was driven by several strategic, economic, and cultural considerations. Although not geographically positioned in the Caribbean Sea, Bermuda has longstanding historical and cultural ties with the Caribbean region. By joining CARICOM as an associate member in July 2003, Bermuda sought to strengthen these connections and benefit from regional collaboration.

One of the primary motivations for Bermuda's association with CARICOM was economic cooperation. As a British Overseas Territory, Bermuda is heavily reliant on its financial services sector, particularly insurance and reinsurance. By aligning with CARICOM, Bermuda gained access to a wider regional market, increasing opportunities for trade and investment with other member states. This partnership was aimed at fostering economic diversification, reducing vulnerabilities associated with dependency on a single economic sector.

Additionally, Bermuda's engagement with CARICOM was influenced by a desire to participate in regional policy discussions and frameworks, particularly those involving sustainable development and climate change. The Caribbean region is significantly affected by climate-related challenges, and by joining CARICOM, Bermuda aimed to contribute to and benefit from regional efforts to address these issues through shared expertise, resources, and advocacy.

Moreover, cultural and social factors also played a role. Many Bermuda residents have familial or cultural ties to the Caribbean, and the island shares similar cultural heritage with several CARICOM member states. Through CARICOM, Bermuda sought to strengthen these cultural connections, promote regional unity, and support initiatives in education and cultural exchange.

Finally, political solidarity was a consideration. By joining CARICOM, Bermuda positioned itself within a regional bloc that could provide a collective voice on international stages, enhancing its influence in global arenas. This association allowed Bermuda to collaborate on issues of common interest and strengthen its diplomatic relations within the hemisphere.

"Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents, reaching their southern extreme in the snow petrel's breeding colonies up to 440 kilometres (270 mi) inland in Antarctica. The highest bird diversity occurs in tropical regions. It was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher speciation rates in the tropics, however recent studies found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset by greater extinction rates than in the tropics. Several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world's oceans and in them, with some seabird species coming ashore only to breed and some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 metres (980 ft).",Some seabird species only come ashore for what purpose?,to breed,3,DESC,"Some seabird species only come ashore for what purpose?

Relevant context: Many seabird species lead fascinating lives at sea, only coming ashore for very specific reasons that are crucial to their survival and reproduction. One primary reason these birds visit land is to breed and raise their young. For example, species such as the albatross, puffins, and many types of terns and petrels, only come ashore to nest. The breeding season is a pivotal time in their life cycle, and they typically return to specific breeding sites that offer the safety and resources necessary for rearing chicks.

These breeding sites are often on remote islands or inaccessible coastal cliffs, providing protection from terrestrial predators. The environmental conditions of these sites are important as well; they need to provide enough space for nesting and easy access to the ocean for feeding. Once the young are old enough to survive at sea, these seabirds will return to their pelagic lifestyle, often spending months or even years without touching land again.

During the nesting period, seabirds engage in elaborate courtship rituals to attract mates and tend to their eggs and chicks with great care. They construct nests using available materials such as grass, seaweed, or small stones, and lay eggs that are often camouflaged to blend in with their surroundings. Both parents usually share the responsibilities of incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks, taking turns foraging at sea for food.

Aside from breeding, some seabirds may also come ashore to molt. This process involves shedding and regrowing feathers, which is critical for maintaining the plumage necessary for efficient flight and insulation. Molting is energy-intensive and typically occurs in safe, inland locations where seabirds can remain relatively undisturbed.

Overall, while seabirds spend the majority of their lives at sea, the times they do come ashore are essential for the continuation of their species, highlighting the delicate balance in their unique ecological niche.",387.0,1472.0,1916,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.7792484760284424,0.8917784690856934,5.67668890953064,Breeding,0.8

Relevant context: In ancient Greece, the term used to describe a royal palace was typically ""anaktoro"" (plural: ""anaktora""), which translates to ""royal house"" or ""palace."" The concept of a royal palace in ancient Greece can be primarily traced back to the Mycenaean civilization, where the most famous examples of such structures were found in locations like Mycenae, Tiryns, and Pylos. These ancient palaces served not only as residences for kings and their courts but also as administrative and economic centers.

The Mycenaean palaces were known for their complex architecture, often characterized by central megarons, which were large halls or throne rooms used for ceremonial purposes and receptions. These spaces were typically surrounded by various rooms and corridors, including workshops, storerooms, and living areas. Some of the best-preserved examples of these palaces include the Palace of Nestor at Pylos, which showcases elaborate frescoes and impressive architectural features.

These palatial complexes were fortified, reflecting the political and military power possessed by the Mycenaean rulers. The architecture and layout of these structures exhibit influences from Minoan Crete, indicating cultural exchanges between these civilizations.

In contrast, during later periods, such as Classical Greece, the concept of a royal palace was less prominent due to the rise of city-states and democracy, particularly in places like Athens. However, royal residences continued to exist in regions such as Macedonia, where rulers like Philip II and Alexander the Great built opulent palaces exemplifying the enduring influence of monarchical architecture.

For many years, Cork was the home to Ford Motor Company, which manufactured cars in the docklands area before the plant was closed in 1984. Henry Ford's grandfather was from West Cork, which was one of the main reasons for opening up the manufacturing facility in Cork. But technology has replaced the old manufacturing businesses of the 1970s and 1980s, with people now working in the many I.T. centres of the city – such as Amazon.com, the online retailer, which has set up in Cork Airport Business Park.",Why was it natural to have Ford Motor Company based in Cork?,Henry Ford's grandfather was from West Cork,3,DESC,"Why was it natural to have Ford Motor Company based in Cork?

Relevant context: The decision to base Ford Motor Company in Cork, Ireland, was a strategic move influenced by several natural and historical factors. To begin with, Cork's location as a port city provided significant logistical advantages. Its well-established harbor facilitated easy access to international shipping routes, making the import of raw materials and export of vehicles efficient and cost-effective. This connectivity was crucial for an automobile manufacturer aiming to serve both domestic and European markets.

Furthermore, Cork had a rich industrial heritage, particularly in shipbuilding and engineering, which meant there was a skilled workforce familiar with manufacturing processes. This existing pool of labor could be easily transitioned into the new industry of automobile manufacturing, reducing initial training costs and accelerating startup operations.

Another compelling factor was the personal connection of Henry Ford to the area. Henry Ford's father, William Ford, was born in Ballinascarthy, County Cork, before emigrating to the United States. This familial tie not only provided sentimental value but also built a positive relationship with the local community, which likely smoothed operations and cultivated a supportive business environment.

Additionally, the early 20th century was a period of economic transformation in Ireland, with industries eager to modernize and diversify following the impact of the First World War. Establishing a Ford plant in Cork aligned with national economic goals and received favorable government support, helping to establish the plant as a pioneering facility in Ireland's industrial landscape.

In summary, Cork's advantageous geographic location, its experienced workforce, the personal connection of Henry Ford, and the supportive economic climate all combined to make it a natural choice for the establishment of Ford Motor Company’s operations in Ireland.",338.0,1357.0,1755,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.347883701324463,0.9158143997192383,7.332442760467529,Henry Ford's ancestry,0.0
"In the high villages people live in homes built according to medieval designs that withstand cold winters. The kitchen is separated from the living area (called the stube, the area of the home heated by a stove), and second-floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat. The typical Swiss chalet originated in the Bernese Oberland. Chalets often face south or downhill, and are built of solid wood, with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily. Stairs leading to upper levels are sometimes built on the outside, and balconies are sometimes enclosed.",What do people in high villages build their homes according to?,medieval designs that withstand cold winters,3,DESC,"What do people in high villages build their homes according to?

Relevant context: In high-altitude villages, where the environment presents unique challenges, people construct their homes with specific adaptive strategies in mind. These strategies are deeply influenced by factors such as climate, materials available, and cultural traditions. At these elevations, where temperatures can be significantly lower and weather conditions more severe than in lower regions, the primary consideration is often insulation and warmth. 

To this end, many highland communities build their homes using thick walls made from locally sourced materials like stone or adobe, which have excellent thermal mass properties. This means they can absorb heat during the day and release it slowly at night, helping to maintain a stable indoor temperature. Additionally, roofs are typically sloped steeply to prevent the accumulation of snow and are often constructed with thatch or shingles, materials that provide additional insulation.

The orientation of homes is another critical factor. Houses are often positioned to maximize exposure to the sun, utilizing passive solar heating. This strategy may include large south-facing windows—if culturally appropriate—that allow sunlight to penetrate and warm the interior during the day.

Furthermore, local cultural and aesthetic values play a significant role in the design and construction of homes. In many highland areas, traditional building practices have been passed down through generations, often integrating symbolic elements or communal architectural motifs unique to the culture and history of the region.

In summary, people in high villages build their homes according to a combination of environmental, material, and cultural influences, ensuring that their dwellings are not only functional and comfortable but also aesthetically and culturally consonant with traditional values. These constructions represent a harmonious balance between human ingenuity and the natural world, embodying principles of sustainability and resilience in challenging climates.",346.0,1210.0,1614,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,4.097022533416748,1.0094592571258545,6.111681222915649,medieval designs,0.5
"In the colonial years, while conditions were more fluid, white women, indentured servant or free, and African men, servant, slave or free, made unions. Because the women were free, their mixed-race children were born free; they and their descendants formed most of the families of free people of color during the colonial period in Virginia. The scholar Paul Heinegg found that eighty percent of the free people of color in North Carolina in censuses from 1790–1810 could be traced to families free in Virginia in colonial years.",What is Paul Heinegg?,scholar,3,DESC,"What is Paul Heinegg?

Relevant context: Paul Heinegg is not a ""what,"" but rather a ""who."" He is an author and historian recognized for his exhaustive research on the genealogy and history of free African Americans in the colonial and early American periods, particularly in the Chesapeake region. His work is particularly notable for its focus on families of African descent who were free prior to the Civil War, a subject that has often been overlooked in historical studies.

Heinegg's most significant contribution is his ongoing project and publication, ""Free African Americans of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland,"" which is available both in print and online.

"The origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about 3000 years ago. During pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the nearer islands including Samoa and Tonga. Eight of the nine islands of Tuvalu were inhabited; thus the name, Tuvalu, means ""eight standing together"" in Tuvaluan (compare to *walo meaning ""eight"" in Proto-Austronesian). Possible evidence of fire in the Caves of Nanumanga may indicate human occupation for thousands of years.",What is the native language meaning of Tuvalu?,eight standing together,3,DESC,"What is the native language meaning of Tuvalu?

Relevant context: The name ""Tuvalu"" holds significant meaning in the native language of the island nation, which is Tuvaluan. The word ""Tuvalu"" translates to ""eight standing together"" in Tuvaluan. This name is deeply rooted in the history and composition of the country, as it originally referred to the eight traditionally inhabited islands that comprise the nation. These islands are part of an archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean, midway between Hawaii and Australia.

Tuvaluan, belonging to the Austronesian language family, serves as one of the official languages of Tuvalu, alongside English. The language reflects the culture and traditions of the Tuvaluan people, encompassing not only their daily speech but also their oral literature and customary practices.

The significance of ""Tuvalu"" goes beyond its literal translation. It embodies the spirit of unity and cooperation among the islands, emphasizing a collective identity despite being geographically dispersed. Historically, Tuvaluan society has been organized around principles of community and shared leadership, reinforcing the concept encapsulated by the phrase ""eight standing together.""

"The Late Triassic spans from 237 million to 200 million years ago. Following the bloom of the Middle Triassic, the Late Triassic featured frequent heat spells, as well as moderate precipitation (10-20 inches per year). The recent warming led to a boom of reptilian evolution on land as the first true dinosaurs evolve, as well as pterosaurs. All this climatic change, however, resulted in a large die-out known as the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event, in which all archosaurs (excluding ancient crocodiles), most synapsids, and almost all large amphibians went extinct, as well as 34% of marine life in the fourth mass extinction event of the world. The cause is debatable.",What was the only archosaur to survive the fourth mass extinction?,crocodiles,3,DESC,"What was the only archosaur to survive the fourth mass extinction?

Relevant context: During the catastrophic event known as the Triassic-Jurassic extinction approximately 201 million years ago, which marked the fourth mass extinction on Earth, a diverse group of reptiles known as archosaurs faced significant challenges. Archosaurs, a clade that includes the ancestors of modern birds and crocodilians, as well as the now-extinct dinosaurs and pterosaurs, were among the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the period. This extinction event, likely triggered by massive volcanic eruptions associated with the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea, led to drastic climate changes, ocean acidification, and the loss of approximately 76% of all marine and terrestrial species.

Amidst this upheaval, however, one lineage of archosaurs endured and adapted, ensuring its survival and eventual prosperity. Birds, belonging to the group known as Avemetatarsalia (or the ""bird-line"" archosaurs), managed to persist through the environmental challenges of this extinction. Although the exact details of how early avemetatarsalians survived remain a subject of scientific research, their adaptation to diverse ecological niches and potential opportunistic feeding strategies may have contributed to their survival.

The resilience of early avian ancestors allowed them to thrive and diversify in the aftermath of the extinction event, eventually giving rise to the vast array of bird species we see today. Their ability to exploit new ecological roles left vacant by the extinction of other species set the stage for the rise of dinosaurs in the Jurassic period, and subsequently, the evolution of birds from small theropod dinosaurs.

While other archosaur lineages did not make it past this fourth mass extinction, the success of the bird-line archosaurs highlights the remarkable adaptability and evolutionary potential of life on Earth, even in the face of catastrophic environmental changes.",370.0,1601.0,2032,1.0,0.2,0.38685280723454163,4.2983081340789795,0.9723813533782959,6.183437824249268,Crocodiles,1.0
"Furthermore, evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple environmental factors leading to extinctions of the holocene megafauna and their replacement by smaller herbivores. North American megafauna extinction was coincidental with the Younger Dryas impact event, possibly making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss than had been previously thought. However, in other locations such as Australia, humans are thought to have played a very significant role in the extinction of the Australian megafauna that was widespread prior to human occupation.",What does evidence suggest hunting may have been a factor in the extinction of?,holocene megafauna,3,DESC,"What does evidence suggest hunting may have been a factor in the extinction of?

Relevant context: Evidence from various archaeological and paleontological studies suggests that hunting by early humans may have been a significant factor in the extinction of several megafauna species across different continents. One of the most cited examples is the extinction of the woolly mammoth, Mammuthus primigenius, which roamed parts of Europe, Asia, and North America until approximately 4,000 years ago. As humans migrated into these regions, evidence such as cut marks on bones and spear points found at archaeological sites indicates that they hunted woolly mammoths for food and resources.

Similarly, in North America, evidence suggests that the hunting practices of the Clovis people may have contributed to the extinction of the American mastodon, Mammut americanum, around 11,000 years ago. Sites containing mastodon remains alongside Clovis spear points provide compelling evidence that humans played a role in their decline.

Additionally, in Australia, the extinction of the Diprotodon, the largest known marsupial, is often linked to the arrival of humans on the continent approximately 50,000 years ago. Although climate change also played a role, the timing of Diprotodon's extinction corresponds closely with evidence of increased human activity, suggesting that hunting may have contributed to their eventual disappearance.

These examples, along with other megafauna extinctions during the Late Pleistocene epoch, form part of the ""overkill hypothesis."" This theory posits that human hunting pressure, combined with environmental changes, led to the rapid decline and eventual extinction of many large animal species. While some scholars argue that climate change and habitat alterations also played crucial roles, the evidence of human involvement through hunting remains a central component in explaining the extinction patterns of these prehistoric giants.",362.0,1343.0,1768,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.288604259490967,0.9650297164916992,5.216374635696411,Holocene megafauna,1.0
"The Kalahari Desert, an arid region shared with South Africa and Botswana, is one of Namibia's well-known geographical features. The Kalahari, while popularly known as a desert, has a variety of localised environments, including some verdant and technically non-desert areas. One of these, known as the Succulent Karoo, is home to over 5,000 species of plants, nearly half of them endemic; Approximately 10 percent of the world's succulents are found in the Karoo. The reason behind this high productivity and endemism may be the relatively stable nature of precipitation.",What is probably the reason there are so many unique plants in Karoo?,stable nature of precipitation,3,DESC,"What is probably the reason there are so many unique plants in Karoo?

Relevant context: The Karoo, a vast semi-desert region in South Africa, is renowned for its remarkable biodiversity, particularly its unique flora. The prevalence of such a wide variety of endemic plant species in the Karoo can be attributed to several key factors, each contributing to the region's botanical diversity.

One of the primary reasons is the Karoo's distinct climatic conditions. The area experiences low and unpredictable rainfall, typically ranging from 100 to 500 millimeters annually, with significant temperature fluctuations between day and night. This harsh, arid environment has led to the evolution of specialized plants, known as xerophytes, which have adapted to survive the extreme conditions. These plants often possess unique adaptations such as succulent leaves for water storage, reflective surfaces to reduce heat absorption, and deep root systems to access groundwater.

Additionally, the Karoo's geological history has played a crucial role in shaping its plant diversity. The landscape is characterized by a variety of soil types, from clay-rich to sandy soils, providing a mosaic of microhabitats. This diversity in soil composition and structure supports a wide array of plant communities, each adapted to specific soil conditions. Over millions of years, geological events such as volcanic activity, erosion, and tectonic movements have further influenced the distribution and speciation of plant life in the region.

The isolation of the Karoo has also significantly contributed to its unique plant life. Enclosed by mountain ranges and rivers, the Karoo has remained relatively isolated over evolutionary timescales. This geographic isolation has encouraged speciation, as plant populations adapt to localized conditions without outside influences. Consequently, many plant species found in the Karoo are endemic, meaning they are not found anywhere else in the world.

Moreover, the region's position at the convergence of three major biodiversity hotspots—the Fynbos, Succulent Karoo, and Nama Karoo biomes—leads to a cross-pollination of plant species from these diverse ecological regions. The interaction and overlap among these biomes create transitional zones where unique plant species can evolve.

In summary, the rich and unique plant life of the Karoo is a product of its challenging climate, diverse geological substrates, historical isolation, and its location at the intersection of significant biomes. Each of these factors has fostered an environment where only the most adaptable and specialized plant species thrive, resulting in the exceptional floral diversity seen today.",492.0,1435.0,1987,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.685737133026123,0.9023833274841309,8.567549228668213,Stable precipitation,0.8
"In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a ""thread"" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).",How high could the temperatures have risen to cause the melting?,5 °C,3,DESC,"How high could the temperatures have risen to cause the melting?

Relevant context: When considering the melting of ice sheets and glaciers, temperature thresholds can vary significantly depending on the specific region and the type of ice involved. In general, the melting of terrestrial glaciers and polar ice caps primarily requires temperatures to rise above the freezing point of water, 0°C (32°F). However, the specific climate conditions needed for significant melting events often involve sustained periods of above-freezing temperatures, sometimes coupled with other environmental factors.

For instance, in the Arctic region, average summer temperatures around 2°C (35.6°F) have been known to contribute significantly to surface melting. During prolonged heatwaves, temperatures might even spike higher, reaching levels like 5°C (41°F) or more, which can lead to accelerated melting processes. 

In Greenland, one of the most significant ice-melting regions on the planet, the surface melting typically begins when air temperatures rise even a slight degree above freezing, often recorded at just 1°C to 3°C (33°F to 37°F). However, to achieve widespread melting over expansive areas, extended periods of warmth above 5°C (41°F) can create conditions for rapid ice loss, especially when coupled with factors like clear skies that increase solar radiation absorption and darkening of ice surfaces due to impurities such as soot.

For Antarctic ice shelves, the threshold is more complex due to their location and unique climate dynamics. Though temperatures rarely breach the freezing point over the continental interiors, coastal areas can experience temperatures close to or above 0°C, particularly during the austral summer, leading to basal melting and structural instabilities in ice shelves.

In these contexts, it's important to account not only for ambient air temperatures but also for ocean temperatures. Warmer ocean currents can increase thermal erosion from below, significantly contributing to ice melting. Sea surface temperatures need only rise by a few degrees Celsius to have a profound impact on icebergs and floating ice sheets through what's known as basal melting.

Additionally, the role of amplification processes, like the feedback effect from meltwater ponds forming on the ice surface, can exacerbate the situation. These ponds, absorbing more sunlight than ice, further increase the local temperature, thereby accelerating melting.

In summary, while the exact temperature threshold for melting will depend on specific regional and local conditions, general patterns indicate that even slight increases in temperature above freezing can lead to significant melting, particularly when these are maintained over time or occur in conjunction with other melting dynamics and feedback mechanisms.",503.0,1761.0,2327,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.266088008880615,1.1565606594085693,8.406170129776001,5 °C (41 °F),0.8

Relevant context: Victoria's isolation, characterized by her early withdrawal from public life following the death of her husband, Prince Albert, gradually gave way to a return to public duties and a renewed presence on the national stage. The initial phase of her seclusion was marked by deep mourning and a retreat into privacy, during which she resided at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight and Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Her withdrawal was met with public frustration and political unease, as the monarchy seemed distant and disconnected from the affairs of state and the lives of her subjects.

However, over time, several factors contributed to Victoria's re-engagement. The persistent efforts of key figures, such as Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, played a critical role in coaxing the Queen back to public responsibilities. Disraeli's flattery and diplomatic skills, alongside the need for the monarchy to maintain its relevance amidst rising republican sentiments, encouraged Victoria to resume a more active role. 

Additionally, significant events such as the Golden Jubilee in 1887 and the Diamond Jubilee in 1897 provided opportunities for Victoria to reconnect with her people, celebrated nationally and throughout the British Empire.

"Tuvalu (i/tuːˈvɑːluː/ too-VAH-loo or /ˈtuːvəluː/ TOO-və-loo), formerly known as the Ellice Islands, is a Polynesian island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, midway between Hawaii and Australia. It comprises three reef islands and six true atolls spread out between the latitude of 5° to 10° south and longitude of 176° to 180°, west of the International Date Line. Its nearest neighbours are Kiribati, Nauru, Samoa and Fiji. Tuvalu has a population of 10,640 (2012 census). The total land area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi).",What originally formed the Tuvalu islands?,reef,3,ENTY,"What originally formed the Tuvalu islands?

Relevant context: The Tuvalu islands, a Polynesian archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean, owe their origins to ancient geological processes tied to the activity of submarine volcanoes. Approximately 124 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period, these volcanic activities under the ocean floor created the beginnings of what would eventually become the atolls and islands of Tuvalu. These underwater volcanoes erupted, and over countless millennia, their lava flows built up layer upon layer, forming volcanic islands that rose above the ocean's surface.

As these volcanic islands aged, the heavy loads of the old lava structures caused them to gradually sink, a process which was compounded by the subsidence of the oceanic crust on which they sat. During this subsidence, a fascinating biological process began to occur: coral polyps, tiny marine animals capable of forming coral reefs, started to colonize the submerged slopes of these volcanic islands. Over vast periods, the coral reefs grew up toward the sunlight, even as the volcanic bases sank. This created the classic coral atoll structure, characterized by a central lagoon surrounded by a ring of coral islands. 

The resulting atolls of Tuvalu, including Funafuti, Nanumea, and Vaitupu, are thus primarily composed of coral deposits. These islands feature a narrow landmass with sandy beaches, palm trees, and a protective barrier that shelters the lagoon. Today, the Tuvalu islands are a prime example of these natural processes, showcasing the magnificent interplay of volcanic activity, coral growth, and oceanic geology that is typical of many South Pacific island chains.

In addition to geological factors, the formation of the atolls of Tuvalu has been influenced by oceanic currents, weather patterns, and sea level changes over time.

"In 1845, Ireland was hit by a potato blight. In the next four years over a million Irish people died and another million emigrated in what became known as the Great Famine. In Ireland, Victoria was labelled ""The Famine Queen"". She personally donated £2,000 to famine relief, more than any other individual donor, and also supported the Maynooth Grant to a Roman Catholic seminary in Ireland, despite Protestant opposition. The story that she donated only £5 in aid to the Irish, and on the same day gave the same amount to Battersea Dogs Home, was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century.",What was the label given to Queen Victoria during the Great Famine?,The Famine Queen,3,ENTY,"What was the label given to Queen Victoria during the Great Famine?

Relevant context: During the Great Famine in Ireland, which lasted from 1845 to 1852, Queen Victoria was often referred to by some of the Irish population with the moniker ""The Famine Queen."" This label encapsulated the resentment many Irish people felt towards the British monarchy and government, whom they held responsible for the inadequate and often negligent response to the catastrophic food shortage. 

The Great Famine, also known as the Irish Potato Famine, led to the deaths of approximately one million people and the emigration of another million. It exacerbated tensions between Ireland and Britain, particularly because the British government's policies were seen as insufficient and, in some cases, intentionally harsh. The widespread suffering and perceived lack of compassion from the monarchy further fueled the discontent.

Queen Victoria's contribution to famine relief, which included a personal donation, was considered modest compared to what was expected from the reigning monarch of such a powerful and wealthy empire. This perception contributed to her being associated with the enduring hardships faced by the Irish population during this period. 

Despite the complexity and nuances of historical responsibilities, ""The Famine Queen"" became a shorthand for expressing the grievances against British rule in Ireland during and after the famine years.

Relevant context: Philip Hardwick, William Adams Nicholson, and Thomas de Grey were all prominent figures in the field of architecture during the 18th and 19th centuries. Each made significant contributions to the architectural landscape of their time, although their styles and the contexts in which they worked differed slightly.

Philip Hardwick (1792–1870) was an influential English architect known for his work during the early to mid-19th century. He is perhaps best remembered for his design of the Euston Arch, the grand entrance to London's Euston Station, which epitomized the neoclassical style that was popular in his era. Hardwick came from a family of architects; his father, Thomas Hardwick, was also a noted architect, which helped lay the foundation for his illustrious career. His works often combined classical elements with the practical needs of burgeoning urban and industrial environments, reflecting the dynamic changes of the Industrial Revolution in Britain.

William Adams Nicholson (1803–1853) was an English architect whose career overlapped somewhat with that of Philip Hardwick. Nicholson is known for his contributions to civic and religious architecture, particularly in Lincolnshire, where he was based. He designed many notable structures, such as the Sessions House in Lincoln and several churches, showcasing his proficiency in Gothic Revival and other historical architectural styles that were revitalized during the 19th century. Nicholson's works often emphasized symmetry and were characterized by their careful attention to detail and historical accuracy.

Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey (1781–1859), was not only an architect but also a politician and an aristocrat. His architectural endeavors were heavily influenced by his travels across Europe, which inspired him to adopt and adapt various classical and continental styles. De Grey's most notable project is Wrest Park in Bedfordshire, where he altered and extended the existing country house into a splendid example of French-style architecture, rarely seen in England at the time. His designs often reflected his eclectic tastes and broad influences, drawing from his vast knowledge of European architecture.

Each of these architects played a vital role in shaping British architecture during their respective periods, contributing to the rich tapestry of styles and innovations that characterized this dynamic era.

Relevant context: While no bird is known to migrate by circling the Earth in a continuous global journey, there are certain species that undertake extensive migratory paths that span hemispheres and cover vast distances akin to circling the globe. One such remarkable bird is the Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea). The Arctic Tern is famous for its extraordinary migratory pattern, which is one of the longest known migrations in the animal kingdom. Each year, this bird travels from its breeding grounds in the Arctic regions, such as Greenland and Iceland, to its wintering grounds in the Antarctic, effectively traversing the globe from the north pole to the south pole and back.

The round-trip journey of an Arctic Tern can cover more than 70,000 kilometers (43,000 miles), a distance that allows the bird to experience two summers each year and more daylight than any other creature on the planet. In their lifetime, Arctic Terns can fly a distance equivalent to three trips to the moon and back.

Their migration route is not simply a straight line; the Arctic Tern follows a complex path that takes advantage of global wind patterns. Terns typically travel down the coast of Europe and Africa in the fall and return north along the coasts of South and North America in the spring, creating a loop that resembles a circle when plotted on a global map.

"The characteristic forms that were to define Gothic architecture grew out of Romanesque architecture and developed at several different geographic locations, as the result of different influences and structural requirements. While barrel vaults and groin vaults are typical of Romanesque architecture, ribbed vaults were used in the naves of two Romanesque churches in Caen, Abbey of Saint-Étienne and Abbaye aux Dames in 1120. Another early example is the nave and apse area of the Cathedral of Cefalù in 1131. The ribbed vault over the north transept at Durham Cathedral in England, built from 1128 to 1133, is probably earlier still and was the first time pointed arches were used in a high vault.",Barrel and groin vaults are examples of what kind of architecture?,Romanesque architecture,3,ENTY,"Barrel and groin vaults are examples of what kind of architecture?

Relevant context: Barrel and groin vaults are quintessential examples of Romanesque architecture, a style that was prominently used in medieval Europe between the 11th and 12th centuries. Romanesque architecture is characterized by its robust and heavy forms, round arches, large towers, and symmetrical plans. Barrel vaults, also known as tunnel vaults, consist of a series of continuous arches that form a tunnel-like structure. This kind of vault is often employed in long corridors or large halls, creating an impression of monumental solidity and grandeur.

Groin vaults, on the other hand, are formed by the perpendicular intersection of two barrel vaults. This design allows for the weight of the vault to be distributed more evenly to the corners of the structure, allowing for larger and more open interior spaces. The development and use of groin vaults were instrumental in allowing builders to construct more complex and larger buildings due to their efficient weight distribution.

Both of these vaulting techniques became foundational elements in Romanesque architecture, contributing to the engineering advances that led to even more innovative developments in Gothic architecture, most notably the ribbed vault. The use of vaults in Romanesque architecture was integral to the design of many notable medieval cathedrals and churches, such as Saint-Sernin in Toulouse, which prominently features barrel and groin vaulting. These architectural elements not only provided structural support but also added to the aesthetic grandeur and acoustics of the medieval religious structures, deeply influencing the evolution of church design in medieval Europe.",322.0,1370.0,1752,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.879511594772339,1.1021902561187744,6.177216291427612,Romanesque,0.8

Relevant context: In 1912, French artists Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes authored a seminal essay titled ""Du 'Cubisme',"" which translates to ""On Cubism."" This work was not only an exposition of the principles and aesthetics of Cubism but also a critical polemic against several prevailing trends and misconceptions in the early 20th-century art world. Metzinger and Gleizes wrote ""Du 'Cubisme'"" as a defense of Cubism against traditional artistic conventions and criticisms that emerged from both academic and public circles.

One of the primary targets of their critique was the entrenched academic realism that dominated the art establishments of the time. This form of art focused heavily on lifelike representations and linear perspective, which Metzinger and Gleizes viewed as outdated modes that failed to capture the complexities of modern life and perception. They argued that Cubism, with its fragmented forms and multiple perspectives, offered a more truthful depiction of reality by reflecting the ways objects are observed over time and from different angles.

Furthermore, Metzinger and Gleizes were responding to criticism from conservative critics who dismissed Cubism as chaotic and unintelligible. Their essay sought to articulate the intellectual underpinnings of Cubist art, emphasizing the movement’s lawful experimentation with form and space rather than mere abstraction for abstraction's sake. They contended that Cubism represented a new way of seeing that was aligned with contemporary innovations in science and philosophy, influenced by the likes of Henri Bergson, who championed new concepts of time and reality.

""Du 'Cubisme'"" also positioned itself against the commercialization and superficiality that often plagued the burgeoning modern art market, advocating instead for a sincere and thoughtful engagement with artistic creation. Metzinger and Gleizes emphasized Cubism’s capacity to engage deeply with the complexities of the modern experience, countering accusations that it was merely a novelty or passing fad.

Through ""Du 'Cubisme',"" Metzinger and Gleizes aimed to clarify misconceptions about Cubism and to establish it as a legitimate and revolutionary movement in art.

"A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian. There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not. These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers. A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit crinoids and ammonites especially hard. This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the Mississippian Period from the Pennsylvanian period.",During which period were epicontinental seas created?,Carboniferous,3,ENTY,"During which period were epicontinental seas created?

Relevant context: Epicontinental seas, also known as epeiric seas, are shallow seas that cover continental landmasses. These significant geological features have been created during several periods throughout Earth's history, marking times when sea levels were considerably higher than they are today. One of the most notable periods for the formation of epicontinental seas was the Paleozoic Era, particularly during the Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian periods, which spanned from approximately 485 to 359 million years ago. 

During the Ordovician Period, which lasted roughly from 485 to 444 million years ago, the Earth experienced a high sea level due to tectonic activity and the melting of polar ice masses. This led to widespread transgressions, or advances of the sea, resulting in the formation of epeiric seas on the interiors of continents like Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia, and others. Similarly, the Silurian Period (around 444 to 419 million years ago) continued this trend of epicontinental sea coverage as the sea levels remained high and tectonic plates shifted.

The Devonian Period (approximately 419 to 359 million years ago) is often called the ""Age of Fishes"" due to the diversification of marine life that thrived in these shallow seas. By then, expansive epicontinental seas had flooded large portions of the continents, creating new marine habitats. Additionally, the Carboniferous Period, which followed the Devonian from about 359 to 299 million years ago, was another significant time for epicontinental seas. This period saw the Earth's sea levels remain high due to continued greenhouse conditions and ice sheet dynamics.

Epicontinental seas were also prominent during the Cretaceous Period, from approximately 145 to 66 million years ago. This was a time when tectonic forces, such as the high rates of sea-floor spreading, caused sea levels to rise, flooding interior regions and creating vast shallow seas, like the Western Interior Seaway in North America.

Overall, epicontinental seas have formed during periods of high sea levels, driven by factors such as global climate changes, tectonic forces, and sea-floor spreading. These seas have left behind extensive sedimentary deposits and fossils, offering vital insights into the past climate, sea levels, and marine biodiversity.",488.0,1821.0,2367,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.023621082305908,1.7038118839263916,10.982482194900513,Proterozoic,0.0
"Asphalt/bitumen is similar to the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites. However, detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct. The vast Alberta bitumen resources are believed to have started out as living material from marine plants and animals, mainly algae, that died millions of years ago when an ancient ocean covered Alberta. They were covered by mud, buried deeply over the eons, and gently cooked into oil by geothermal heat at a temperature of 50 to 150 °C (120 to 300 °F). Due to pressure from the rising of the Rocky Mountains in southwestern Alberta, 80 to 55 million years ago, the oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres into underground sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches, thus forming the oil sands.",What temperatures did the organic deposits need to form bitumen over the eons?,50 to 150 °C,3,ENTY,"What temperatures did the organic deposits need to form bitumen over the eons?

Relevant context: The formation of bitumen, a highly viscous and dense form of petroleum, is a complex geological process that requires specific temperature conditions over millions of years. Organic deposits, primarily composed of the remains of microscopic marine organisms, must undergo several stages of transformation to become bitumen. These stages are influenced significantly by geothermal heat and pressure within the Earth's crust.

Initially, the deposition of organic material in sedimentary basins leads to the formation of kerogen through diagenesis, a process occurring at relatively low temperatures, typically between 50 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 65 degrees Celsius). This stage involves the breakdown and transformation of organic matter under anaerobic conditions, laying the groundwork for further chemical changes.

As sedimentary layers build up over millions of years, the buried organic material is subjected to increased heat and pressure, leading to catagenesis. During this phase, the temperature range becomes more critical, spanning approximately 122 to 302 degrees Fahrenheit (50 to 150 degrees Celsius). It is within this temperature window that the kerogen undergoes thermal cracking, breaking down into smaller hydrocarbon molecules, including bitumen.

For organic deposits to specifically form bitumen, rather than lighter hydrocarbons like crude oil, they require prolonged exposure to temperatures at the lower end of the oil window. This means that temperatures generally stabilize between 140 and 194 degrees Fahrenheit (60 to 90 degrees Celsius). These conditions need to persist over extensive periods, often millions of years, allowing for the gradual increase in molecular complexity and viscosity characteristic of bitumen.

The precise geothermal gradient—how temperature increases with depth—varies by geographic location and geological settings. However, maintaining the necessary temperature range over geological time scales is vital. Any deviation, such as temperatures rising too high (beyond 200 degrees Celsius), could lead to the breakdown of bitumen into natural gas, while insufficient heat might leave the kerogen only partially transformed.

In summary, bitumen formation from organic deposits requires a delicate balance of time, temperature, and pressure, with key temperatures typically between 140 and 194 degrees Fahrenheit (60 to 90 degrees Celsius) maintained over millions of years in the subsurface environment. This intricate dance of geological processes illustrates the unique pathways through which nature converts ancient organic matter into vital energy resources.",478.0,1725.0,2268,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.443563222885132,16.76885485649109,26.190685510635376,50 to 150 °C,1.0

Relevant context: King George II, who reigned as the King of Great Britain and Ireland from 1727 until his death in 1760, did not have a royal residence beginning in 1762 because he had already passed away by that time. The query might be confused with King George III or another member of the royal family. However, by examining the context of royal residences during the 18th century, we can explore related developments around that period.

In 1762, King George III ascended to the throne and made significant changes in the royal residences used by the monarchy. Notably, Buckingham House, which would later become known as Buckingham Palace, was purchased by King George III in 1761 for his wife, Queen Charlotte. This purchase marked the beginning of the residence's transformation into a principal royal residence, especially after extensive renovations. Prior to this, St. James's Palace served as the principal official residence of the monarch.

Thus, while King George II did not have a residence starting in 1762 due to his death two years prior, his successor, King George III, initiated what would become a significant royal establishment in 1762 with Buckingham House. This landmark moment set the stage for Buckingham Palace's central role in British monarchy in subsequent centuries.",271.0,1391.0,1723,1.0,0.16666666666666666,0.3562071871080222,3.370692491531372,1.4944584369659424,5.783179521560669,The Queen's House,0.0

The federal government of the United States manages vast tracts of land designated as public lands, encompassing a diverse range of natural environments and resources. These lands are categorized into several key types, each serving different purposes and managed by various federal agencies.

**National Parks** are perhaps the most iconic public lands, managed by the National Park Service (NPS). These areas are preserved for their natural beauty, historical significance, and recreational opportunities. National parks like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon offer breathtaking landscapes and are protected to maintain their ecological integrity and cultural heritage.

**National Forests** are managed by the U.S. Forest Service under the Department of Agriculture. These lands are primarily focused on resource management, including timber, watershed protection, and public recreation. National forests are often used for hiking, camping, and other outdoor activities, balancing conservation with sustainable use.

**National Wildlife Refuges**, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, prioritize the conservation of fish, wildlife, and plant resources. These areas are crucial for habitat protection and biodiversity, providing safe havens for threatened and endangered species and offering opportunities for wildlife observation and research.

**Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Lands** cover the largest area of public lands in the United States. Primarily located in the western states, these lands are managed for multiple uses, including grazing, mining, oil and gas development, and recreation. BLM lands often include ranges, deserts, and unique geological formations.

**National Monuments** are protected areas that can be managed by various agencies, including the NPS, BLM, or the Forest Service, depending on their location and designation. These areas are recognized for their natural, historical, or cultural importance, often established by presidential proclamation to protect and preserve significant landmarks and artifacts.

**National Conservation Areas and Scenic Rivers** are designated to protect valuable natural landscapes and river systems. Managed by different agencies, these designations ensure the preservation of ecological and scenic values, supporting both environmental objectives and recreation.

In addition to these well-known categories, the federal government also oversees specialized areas such as **Wilderness Areas** (pristine regions preserved in their natural state), **Historical Sites**, and **Recreational Areas**, each serving specific conservation, educational, and recreational goals.

Relevant context: In a comprehensive study conducted in 2010, Detroit was ranked as one of the most segregated cities in the United States. This study, often cited for its in-depth analysis of racial segregation patterns, utilized various metrics to assess segregation levels across metropolitan areas in the country. Detroit's ranking was primarily based on the dissimilarity index, which measures the evenness with which two groups are distributed across a city. In this index, a higher score indicates greater segregation.

The study highlighted that Detroit's history of racial division was a significant factor contributing to its high ranking. Patterns of housing discrimination, economic disparities, and policy decisions throughout the 20th century had cemented the separation between predominantly African American neighborhoods and predominantly White suburbs. This segregation was reflected in numerous aspects of life, including school districts, access to public services, and employment opportunities.

Researchers noted that Detroit's segregation was not purely a modern phenomenon but the culmination of historical practices such as redlining and racially restrictive covenants that had systematically marginalized African American communities. The city's ranking in the 2010 study was used to underscore the ongoing challenges that Detroit faced in bridging racial divides and fostering more inclusive urban development.

"New Haven lies in the transition between a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfa) and humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), but having more characteristics of the former, as is typical of much of the New York metropolitan area. Summers are humid and warm, with temperatures exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) on 7–8 days per year. Winters are cold with moderate snowfall interspersed with rainfall and occasionally mixed precipitation. The weather patterns that affect New Haven result from a primarily offshore direction, thus reducing the marine influence of Long Island Sound—although, like other marine areas, differences in temperature between areas right along the coastline and areas a mile or two inland can be large at times.","Though harboring transitive properties, what Koppen climate classification does the New Haven climate more closely characterize?",Dfa,3,ENTY,"Though harboring transitive properties, what Koppen climate classification does the New Haven climate more closely characterize?

Relevant context: New Haven, located in the southern part of Connecticut, experiences a climate that closely aligns with the Köppen climate classification of Cfa, known as the humid subtropical climate. Though it's important to note that New Haven's climate can exhibit transitional traits due to its geographical positioning along the northeastern coast of the United States, the Cfa classification best characterizes its overall climatic conditions. 

The Cfa classification is generally marked by hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters, which is largely consistent with New Haven's climate profile. During the summer months, average high temperatures frequently reach into the 80s Fahrenheit (27-32°C), and humidity levels can be high, contributing to the sultry summer feel typical of a humid subtropical climate. However, the influence of the nearby Long Island Sound can moderate temperatures slightly, offering relief from the intense heat experienced further inland.

In the winter, New Haven typically sees average temperatures in the 30s and 40s Fahrenheit (0-7°C), with occasional cold snaps that bring temperatures below freezing. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, with no distinct dry season, and winter months often see snowfall, although it is typically less than what is experienced further north or in more continental climates.

New Haven's climate may sometimes exhibit characteristics of a Dfa climate, or hot-summer humid continental climate, especially during the transition months. However, its winter conditions are generally milder than those of a true Dfa classification. This transitional nature highlights the city's position on the boundary between these two climate types, yet the prevailing conditions affirm the humid subtropical classification as a more accurate depiction overall. The interplay between its latitude and proximity to the coast contributes to the subtle complexity of New Haven's climate profile.",376.0,1907.0,2354,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.3667330741882324,1.8174736499786377,6.533361434936523,Humid continental (Dfa),0.5
"Bermuda's economy is based on offshore insurance and reinsurance, and tourism, the two largest economic sectors. Bermuda had one of the world's highest GDP per capita for most of the 20th century and several years beyond. Recently, its economic status has been affected by the global recession. It has a subtropical climate. Bermuda is the northernmost point of the Bermuda Triangle, a region of sea in which, according to legend, a number of aircraft and surface vessels have disappeared under supposedly unexplained or mysterious circumstances. The island is in the hurricane belt and prone to severe weather. However, it is somewhat protected from the full force of a hurricane by the coral reef that surrounds the island.",What type of climate does Bermuda have?,subtropical,3,ENTY,"What type of climate does Bermuda have?

Relevant context: Bermuda is known for its distinct subtropical climate, which is characterized by mild winters and warm, humid summers. Situated in the North Atlantic Ocean, approximately 650 miles off the coast of North Carolina, Bermuda benefits from the moderating influence of the nearby Gulf Stream. This oceanic current significantly affects Bermuda’s climate, keeping the island warmer than other regions of similar latitude. 

During the summer months, which extend from around May to October, temperatures in Bermuda typically range from the mid-70s to the mid-80s Fahrenheit (about 24-29°C). Humidity is relatively high during this period, often surpassing 80 percent, which can make the air feel warmer. The island receives a substantial amount of rainfall during summer, often in the form of short, intense showers or thunderstorms. Despite this, prolonged periods of rain are uncommon during summer.

Winters in Bermuda, spanning from November to April, are remarkably mild compared to the harsh cold experienced in continental temperate regions. Average winter temperatures range from the mid-50s to the mid-60s Fahrenheit (approximately 13-19°C). The island experiences less humidity in winter, along with reduced rainfall, though occasional storms can still occur. It's rare for Bermuda to experience frost or snow due to the moderating oceanic influences.

Bermuda is also situated in a region susceptible to tropical cyclones, and the official Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November. While Bermuda occasionally experiences the impacts of hurricanes, the well-constructed infrastructure and advanced weather forecasting help to mitigate potential damage.

Overall, Bermuda’s climate is quite appealing for those seeking a pleasant, moderate climate with plenty of sunshine, although the occasional threat of hurricanes and high humidity in summer are factors to consider.

"Pockets of Georgian architecture survived the war, but much of the city was levelled. There has been extensive redevelopment since World War II. Increasing traffic congestion in the 1920s led to partial demolition of medieval walls around the Bargate in 1932 and 1938. However a large portion of those walls remain.",Some of the walls around which landmark were demolished in the 1930s?,the Bargate,3,ENTY,"Some of the walls around which landmark were demolished in the 1930s?

Relevant context: In the 1930s, a significant portion of the city walls surrounding the historic city of Beijing in China was demolished. These walls had been a defining feature of Beijing since the early Ming Dynasty, built in the 15th century under the reign of the Yongle Emperor. The original walls measured an impressive 24 kilometers in length, with a height of about 15 meters and width at the base of 20 meters, primarily constructed from rammed earth clad with bricks. 

The decision to demolish parts of the wall was influenced by a rapidly modernizing city that needed to accommodate increased traffic and urban development. By the 1930s, Beijing's population was expanding, and the pressure to create new infrastructure was mounting. Some sections were removed to make way for new roads, which were essential for improving transportation and connectivity in the city. This modernization effort was part of a broader trend during this era, where many cities around the world were reconfiguring their urban layouts to align with contemporary needs.

The impact of this demolition was both practical and cultural. While it facilitated modernization, many locals and historians lamented the loss of the ancient fortifications seen as symbols of Chinese heritage and identity. This change is often cited as a crucial moment in Beijing's transition from a historically enclosed city to a sprawling modern metropolis.

"Theoretical analyses show that detours that increase flight distance by up to 20% will often be adaptive on aerodynamic grounds - a bird that loads itself with food to cross a long barrier flies less efficiently. However some species show circuitous migratory routes that reflect historical range expansions and are far from optimal in ecological terms. An example is the migration of continental populations of Swainson's thrush Catharus ustulatus, which fly far east across North America before turning south via Florida to reach northern South America; this route is believed to be the consequence of a range expansion that occurred about 10,000 years ago. Detours may also be caused by differential wind conditions, predation risk, or other factors.",What type of bird show circuitous migratory routes?,Swainson's thrush,3,ENTY,"What type of bird show circuitous migratory routes?

Relevant context: The Arctic Tern is a remarkable bird known for its intricate and circuitous migratory routes. As a long-distance migrant, the Arctic Tern boasts one of the longest migratory journeys in the animal kingdom. Each year, these birds travel from their breeding grounds in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions to their wintering sites in the Antarctic, covering an astounding round-trip distance of approximately 70,000 kilometers (around 43,500 miles) annually.

However, what makes the Arctic Tern's migration particularly noteworthy is not just the distance but the intricate, loop-like route it follows. Instead of taking a direct path, the Arctic Tern takes advantage of prevailing wind patterns and ocean currents, which significantly aid its extended travel. During their southbound migration from the North Atlantic, for example, Arctic Terns often follow a zigzag pattern that takes them as far east as the coast of Africa, incorporating stops that allow them to rest and feed efficiently.

Moreover, their route is not static. Depending on conditions such as weather and food availability, Arctic Terns can alter their course year by year, showcasing their adaptability and navigational prowess. Scientists believe that these birds can use the Earth's magnetic field as well as the position of the sun and stars to guide their way across vast distances.

The complexity of their journey is a subject of extensive study using technology such as geolocators, which provide insights into the fine details of their migration. These studies have not only helped underscore the incredible endurance and resilience of Arctic Terns but also their role as key indicators of environmental changes occurring along their migratory paths.

In conclusion, the Arctic Tern is a prime example of a bird that follows a circuitous migratory path, demonstrating a unique blend of navigational insight and adaptability to environmental challenges. The study of their routes continues to offer valuable data on migratory behaviors and ecological shifts on a global scale.",395.0,1426.0,1881,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.481683731079102,1.2108118534088135,7.915960311889648,Swainson's thrush,1.0
"Gothic architecture is a style of architecture that flourished during the high and late medieval period. It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. Originating in 12th-century France and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as Opus Francigenum (""French work"") with the term Gothic first appearing during the later part of the Renaissance. Its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault and the flying buttress. Gothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great cathedrals, abbeys and churches of Europe. It is also the architecture of many castles, palaces, town halls, guild halls, universities and to a less prominent extent, private dwellings, such as dorms and rooms.",What style of architecture did Gothic architecture evolve from?,Romanesque architecture,3,ENTY,"What style of architecture did Gothic architecture evolve from?

Relevant context: Gothic architecture, which flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages, evolved from the earlier Romanesque style of architecture. The transition began in the 12th century and continued into the 16th century. Romanesque architecture, which dominated the 10th and 11th centuries, is characterized by its massive quality, thick walls, round arches, sturdy pillars, groin vaults, large towers, and decorative arcading.

This architectural style was heavily influenced by both Roman and Byzantine architectural traditions, incorporating certain features such as barrel vaults and large grand towers. The evolution from Romanesque to Gothic was marked by significant structural and aesthetic innovations, most notably the adoption of the pointed arch, which allowed for more flexibility in building design and greater height. This, in turn, enabled the development of other iconic Gothic features, such as the ribbed vault and flying buttress.

These innovations allowed for larger windows and higher ceilings, giving way to the iconic stained-glass windows and vertical lines that characterize Gothic cathedrals. The move toward Gothic architecture can be seen most clearly in the emergence of a focus on light and height, aiming to create spaces that felt heavenly and uplifting. The Abbey of Saint-Denis, near Paris, is frequently cited as one of the earliest examples of Gothic architecture, where many of these innovations were first put to the test under Abbot Suger in the 12th century.

Thus, Gothic architecture's transition from Romanesque represented a deliberate shift towards structures that emphasized verticality, lightness, and ornate detailing. It responded to the changing theological and social needs of the time, aimed at glorifying God through architectural beauty and innovation.",353.0,1396.0,1806,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.4279067516326904,1.1945688724517822,5.754843473434448,Romanesque architecture,1.0

Relevant context: One festival that beautifully intertwines the tradition of flying kites with the celebration of fruit trees is the ""Basant Panchami"" or ""Vasant Panchami"" festival, predominantly celebrated in the Indian subcontinent. This vibrant festival marks the arrival of spring and is usually observed in late January or early February. 

In regions like Punjab and Haryana in India, and Lahore in Pakistan, Basant Panchami is synonymous with kite flying. The clear blue skies are dotted with colorful kites of various shapes and sizes, as people of all ages take part in friendly kite-flying competitions. Kite enthusiasts prepare days in advance, creating special threads coated with a mixture of ground glass and adhesive to engage in 'kite battles' with other fliers.

The festival isn't just about kites; it has significant agricultural and cultural elements as well. It coincides with the flowering of mustard plants in the fields, which paints the landscape in vibrant yellow hues, mirroring the festival's color theme. Many people adorn themselves in bright yellow clothes, representing the blossoming mustard fields and the spirit of positivity and energy associated with spring.

Fruit trees, particularly mango and other fruit-bearing plants, are also ceremonially important during this time. In rural areas, it's common for communities to organize fairs under large, sprawling mango trees or other local fruit groves. These gatherings often include traditional music and dance, along with rituals aimed at ensuring a good harvest in the coming months.

Moreover, Basant Panchami also has a spiritual aspect, especially in Hindu communities, where it is dedicated to the goddess Saraswati, the deity of knowledge, music, and arts. Often, people set up small altars under a fruit tree, offering fruits, flowers, and yellow-colored sweets to seek her blessings.

In summary, Basant Panchami is a vibrant festival that celebrates the arrival of spring with kite flying and acknowledges the importance of fruit trees through communal gatherings and rituals aimed at a prosperous harvest year.

"South America became linked to North America through the Isthmus of Panama during the Pliocene, bringing a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive marsupial faunas. The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean. Africa's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea, cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean. Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about 2.58 million years ago (the start of the Quaternary Period), the current ice age began. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000 years.",What is the link between North and South America called?,the Isthmus of Panama,3,ENTY,"What is the link between North and South America called?

Relevant context: The link between North and South America is called the Isthmus of Panama. This narrow strip of land plays a crucial geographical role as it connects the continental landmasses of North and South America while also separating the Pacific Ocean from the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. 

The Isthmus of Panama extends approximately 400 miles (640 kilometers) from the southern border of Costa Rica to the northwestern edge of Colombia. It is particularly significant for containing the Panama Canal, an engineering marvel that drastically reduces travel time for maritime vessels by allowing them to bypass the lengthy and treacherous Cape Horn route at the southern tip of South America.

Historically, the Isthmus of Panama became a focal point during the early 16th century when Spanish explorers recognized its strategic value for trade and transportation. This region's importance only grew with time, ultimately leading to the construction of the Panama Canal, completed in 1914, which has since become a vital artery of global trade.

The Isthmus not only serves as a geopolitical boundary that divides the two continents but also acts as a biological corridor that facilitates species migration and biodiversity exchange between North and South America. This makes it a region of environmental significance, hosting a range of unique ecosystems and contributing to the rich biodiversity of the Americas.

"Three-phase AC railway electrification was used in Italy, Switzerland and the United States in the early twentieth century. Italy was the major user, for lines in the mountainous regions of northern Italy from 1901 until 1976. The first lines were the Burgdorf-Thun line in Switzerland (1899), and the lines of the Ferrovia Alta Valtellina from Colico to Chiavenna and Tirano in Italy, which were electrified in 1901 and 1902. Other lines where the three-phase system were used were the Simplon Tunnel in Switzerland from 1906 to 1930, and the Cascade Tunnel of the Great Northern Railway in the United States from 1909 to 1927.",What countries  used three-phase AC system in the the beginning of 20th century?,"Italy, Switzerland and the United States",3,ENTY,"What countries  used three-phase AC system in the the beginning of 20th century?

Relevant context: In the early 20th century, the adoption of the three-phase alternating current (AC) system marked a significant advancement in electrical engineering and power distribution. This system, pioneered by Nikola Tesla and popularized by Westinghouse Electric, offered improved efficiency and reliability over the direct current (DC) systems that were previously in widespread use.

Several countries were pioneers in implementing the three-phase AC system during this period. Germany was among the first to embrace this technology, largely due to the work of Oskar von Miller and other engineers who recognized its potential for long-distance power transmission and industrial applications. The first large-scale three-phase AC power plant, built in 1891 in Lauffen am Neckar, Germany, demonstrated its viability by transmitting electricity over a 175 km distance to Frankfurt.

Following Germany's lead, Switzerland also quickly adopted the three-phase system. The country’s abundant hydropower resources made it an ideal candidate for using this efficient system to connect remote generation sites with urban centers. The Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon, a Swiss engineering company, played a crucial role in developing and promoting three-phase systems both within Switzerland and abroad.

In Italy, the three-phase system was adopted in the Alpine region, where hydroelectric power plants were becoming more common. The construction of the Adamello HPP (hydroelectric power plant) in the early 1900s exemplified Italy's early adoption of three-phase technology, reflecting the country’s industrial growth at the time.

In the United States, the transition to three-phase AC systems was championed by Westinghouse Electric and General Electric. The Niagara Falls power project, completed in 1895, was one of the earliest large-scale implementations of this technology in America. It served as a model both technically and commercially for other countries considering the switch from DC to AC systems.

France also began utilizing three-phase systems in the early 20th century, spurred by industrialization and the need to connect its growing number of power stations across varying terrains. The Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques was instrumental in developing the necessary technology in France to support this transition.

Thus, at the dawn of the 20th century, countries like Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the United States, and France were at the forefront of adopting the three-phase AC system. This move set the stage for further technological improvements and the widespread adoption of efficient and reliable electricity networks, shaping modern electrical infrastructure globally.",512.0,2356.0,2935,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.668905019760132,1.0725512504577637,10.050781726837158,"Italy, Switzerland, United States",1.0

Relevant context: Certainly! Here's a detailed passage:

The intense football rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester United, two of England's most storied football clubs, can be traced back to developments in the 19th century. While the rivalry may have reached a pinnacle with individual matches and competitive league standings in the 20th century, its roots are entwined with broader social and economic tensions between the two cities.

The rivalry's origin is often linked to the industrial revolution and the competition between Liverpool and Manchester as major economic hubs in Northern England. By the late 19th century, Liverpool was a bustling seaport, serving as a gateway for international trade. In contrast, Manchester had established itself as an industrial powerhouse, particularly in the textile industry.

The completion of the Manchester Ship Canal, which opened in 1894, played a crucial role in exacerbating tensions between the two cities. The canal allowed ships to bypass Liverpool, enabling Manchester to establish its port and compete directly with Liverpool’s shipping industry. This economic competition heightened civic pride on both sides and set the stage for broader cultural and sporting rivalries.

When it comes to football, the clubs from each city, Liverpool F.C. and Manchester United, began to embody these civic identities. The first official competitive match between the two clubs occurred on April 28, 1894, when Manchester United, then known as Newton Heath, faced Liverpool in a test match to secure a place in the First Division. Liverpool triumphed with a 2-0 victory, a result that forced United to stay in the Second Division.

Throughout the 20th century, as both clubs achieved domestic and European success, the football rivalry further intensified. Key moments on the pitch, combined with the clubs’ dominance in English football and their respective loyal fan bases, helped solidify the fierce rivalry we know today.

Thus, the rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester, while famously played out on football grounds, is rooted in historical economic competition, with the Manchester Ship Canal as a significant spark.

In connection with a 1917 master plan for a central Chicago campus and President Walter Dill Scott's capital campaign, 8.5 acres (3.44 ha) of land were purchased at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Lake Shore Drive for $1.5 million in 1920. The architect James Gamble Rogers was commissioned to create a master plan for the principal buildings on the new campus which he designed in collegiate gothic style. In 1923, Mrs. Montgomery Ward donated $8 million to the campaign to finance the construction of the Montgomery Ward Memorial Building which would house the medical and dental schools and to create endowments for faculty chairs, research grants, scholarships, and building maintenance. The building would become the first university skyscraper in the United States. In addition to the Ward Building, Rogers designed Wieboldt Hall to house facilities for the School of Commerce and Levy Mayer Hall to house the School of Law. The new campus comprising these three new buildings was dedicated during a two-day ceremony in June 1927. The Chicago campus continued to expand with the addition of Thorne Hall in 1931 and Abbott Hall in 1939.

"At the start of her reign Victoria was popular, but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mother's ladies-in-waiting, Lady Flora Hastings, developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an out-of-wedlock pregnancy by Sir John Conroy. Victoria believed the rumours. She hated Conroy, and despised ""that odious Lady Flora"", because she had conspired with Conroy and the Duchess of Kent in the Kensington System. At first, Lady Flora refused to submit to a naked medical examination, until in mid-February she eventually agreed, and was found to be a virgin. Conroy, the Hastings family and the opposition Tories organised a press campaign implicating the Queen in the spreading of false rumours about Lady Flora. When Lady Flora died in July, the post-mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen. At public appearances, Victoria was hissed and jeered as ""Mrs. Melbourne"".","Who was rumored to be the father of Flora Hastings ""pregnancy""?",Sir John Conroy,3,HUM,"Who was rumored to be the father of Flora Hastings ""pregnancy""?

Relevant context: In the early 19th century, a scandal erupted in the British royal court surrounding Flora Hastings, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent. The controversy began in 1839 when it was rumored that Flora Hastings was pregnant, despite being unmarried—a serious allegation that jeopardized her reputation.

The situation was further complicated by the widely circulated rumor that Sir John Conroy, a close associate of the Duchess of Kent and a controversial figure within the royal household, was the father of the supposed pregnancy. Conroy was known for his ambitious nature and had been a powerful advisor to the Duchess, holding considerable influence over her affairs. This relationship, coupled with the tense atmosphere at court, fueled the speculation about his involvement with Hastings.

However, the rumors were based on misunderstandings and misinformation. Flora Hastings had been suffering from abdominal pain, which, once investigated, was determined to be caused by a liver condition and an enlarged liver, rather than pregnancy. Tragically, she died later that year, and an autopsy confirmed the true nature of her illness, exonerating her from the scandalous claims of pregnancy. The incident left a stain on the reputations of those who had spread the rumors and contributed to the strain in the court dynamics surrounding Queen Victoria and her mother's household.

In summary, the gossip that implicated Sir John Conroy as the father of Flora Hastings's non-existent pregnancy underscores the intrigue and tension of the Victorian court, illustrating how quickly rumor and suspicion could spiral into scandal.",321.0,2086.0,2469,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.197494983673096,0.9346432685852051,8.065375089645386,Sir John Conroy,1.0
"Originally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as ""The Queen's House"".

Relevant context: In the 19th century, Buckingham Palace underwent significant architectural transformations to accommodate the changing needs of the British monarchy and to better reflect its stature. Two prominent architects were commissioned to oversee these expansions, each leaving a distinct mark on the historic residence.

First, John Nash, an acclaimed architect of the Regency era, was tasked with enlarging and remodeling Buckingham House into Buckingham Palace. Commissioned by King George IV in 1825, Nash's design included a new suite of state rooms, an impressive and stately facade, and the use of classical and ornate styles that exemplified the opulence of the period. His contributions also saw the addition of the Marble Arch, which initially served as the ceremonial entrance to the expanded palace.

Later in the century, when Queen Victoria ascended the throne, the palace again needed expansion to accommodate her growing family and the increased demands of state occasions. In 1847, architect Edward Blore was commissioned to continue the development. Blore embarked on significant extensions and reconfigurations, which involved adding a new wing to the east, thus creating the renowned quadrangle. Blore's work, although less lavish than Nash's, was crucial in enhancing the palace's functionality and grandeur.

"The growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both national and international level mirroring the male competitions. Women's football has faced many struggles. It had a ""golden age"" in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches; this was stopped on 5 December 1921 when England's Football Association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs.

Relevant context: The 1990s are often heralded as the ""golden age"" of women's football, a landmark decade that witnessed transformative growth and increased international recognition of the sport. This era marked the shift from amateur status to a professional dimension, laying the groundwork for the future of women's football.

One of the key milestones of the 1990s was the inaugural FIFA Women's World Cup, held in China in 1991. This tournament was a historic event, showcasing the talents of women footballers on a global stage and providing a platform for the sport's expansion. The United States emerged victorious, and players like Michelle Akers and Mia Hamm became household names, inspiring a new generation of female athletes.

Another defining moment of the decade came with the inclusion of women's football in the Olympic Games. The Atlanta 1996 Olympics was the first to feature women's football, further cementing its importance and legitimacy in the international sporting community. During this competition, the United States claimed the gold medal, enhancing the sport's visibility and popularity, particularly in North America.

Domestically, several countries launched professional or semi-professional leagues that provided more structured opportunities for women to play competitively. For example, the formation of the W-League in the United States in the early '90s was pivotal in providing a competitive platform for women players in the United States, which spurred the development of women's football domestically and laid the foundation for future professional leagues like the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL).

The 1990s also saw a significant shift in attitudes towards women's football, with increasing media coverage and sponsorships that began to treat women's football not just as an adjunct to the men's game but as a valuable and standalone sport. Countries such as Norway, Germany, and China invested in their women's programs, leading to strong performances on the global stage.

In retrospect, the advancements of the 1990s were crucial to establishing the credibility and popularity of women's football worldwide, setting the stage for the sport's further evolution in the 21st century. The investment in women's football during this decade has had lasting impacts on youth participation rates, professional opportunities, and the general perception of women in sports.

During this period, it was not uncommon for football clubs to take inspiration from successful and influential teams, adopting similar styles to create a sense of modernity and competitive spirit.

Norwich City's 1938 kit featured a classic, streamlined shirt with a subtle yet notable v-neck collar, which was a common design element among many football teams at the time.

This change happened during the week of May 17, 2010, when ""Dancing with the Stars"" overtook ""American Idol"" in the ratings for the very first time. The combination of fresh dance routines, celebrity participants, and engaging competition brought in an audience of approximately 22.4 million viewers for the ""Dancing with the Stars"" finale, edging out ""American Idol,"" which had pulled in about 19.6 million viewers that week.

Several factors contributed to this ratings shift. First, ""American Idol"" was navigating a transitional period, having lost key judge Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell had announced his impending departure. This contributed to a perceived lack of the dynamic judging panel that had been central to the show's appeal. Furthermore, the contestant pool in season nine did not capture the audience's imagination as strongly as in previous seasons, with critics and audiences alike noting a weaker lineup.

Relevant context: The title ""Father of Route 66"" is widely attributed to Cyrus Avery, a visionary businessman and civic leader from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Born on August 31, 1871, in Stevensville, Pennsylvania, Avery moved to Oklahoma in the early 20th century, where he played a crucial role in the development of U.S. Route 66. His foresight in envisioning a national highway system that connected rural areas with urban centers helped lay the groundwork for what would become one of America’s most iconic roads.

Cyrus Avery was instrumental in the creation of the U.S. Highway System in the 1920s. As a member of the federal board that was formed to establish this system, Avery advocated for a highway that would extend from Chicago to Los Angeles. He saw potential in a route that ran diagonally across the Midwest, facilitating commerce and travel by connecting small towns and major cities. Avery's Tulsa location became his base for lobbying efforts, where he successfully argued that such a route would provide travelers with easy access to the vast beauty and resources of the American West.

Avery coined the term ""Main Street of America"" to describe Route 66, underscoring its cultural and economic importance. His efforts were particularly focused on ensuring the route’s path through Tulsa, which further cemented his legacy in the region. When the American Association of State Highway Officials finally ratified the numbering of federal highways in 1926, Route 66 officially became part of the national highway system, and Avery's vision was realized.

Cyrus Avery’s contributions to American transportation did not stop at Route 66. Throughout his life, he championed infrastructure projects that modernized roads and supported automotive travel. Despite facing challenges such as the Great Depression, Route 66 became an essential corridor for migration westward, famously used by those heading to California during the Dust Bowl years.

Relevant context: In the realm of English folklore and religious visions, there is a well-known story about a 12th-century monk who reportedly had a vision of Saint Peter while standing near the banks of the River Thames. The monk, named Aelfric, belonged to an abbey in what is now the greater London area. This vision, which purportedly took place around the year 1154, was later documented in the monastic chronicles of the abbey, becoming a subject of intrigue and spiritual reflection in the local community.

According to these chronicles, Aelfric was in a state of deep contemplation, troubled by the growing political tensions between the monarchy and the church. One evening, as he walked alone by the River Thames, he claimed to see a luminous figure standing on the water. This figure, whom Aelfric identified as Saint Peter, appeared surrounded by a halo of light and held keys that shimmered with an ethereal glow.

In his vision, Aelfric reported that Saint Peter spoke to him, offering a message of peace and urging prayer for unity among the people. This event was interpreted by many of his contemporaries as a divine sign, prompting renewed faith and efforts to mediate between conflicting powers.

The story of Aelfric's vision spread throughout the region, becoming a part of the oral tradition. As with many such mystical experiences, it was met with both skepticism and reverence. While some contemporaries doubted the authenticity of his vision, others found in it a source of spiritual reassurance and a call to maintain ecclesiastical harmony.

Over time, the legend of Aelfric's encounter with Saint Peter on the Thames would become a subject of artistic depiction, inspiring paintings and writings that sought to capture the essence of this sacred encounter.

"For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world, who arrive in the city to educate themselves and to seek inspiration from its vast pool of artistic resources and galleries. As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the ""City of Art"". Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royals commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.",What art was Paris famous for in the 16th and 17th centuries?,sculpture and reliefs,3,HUM,"What art was Paris famous for in the 16th and 17th centuries?

Relevant context: During the 16th and 17th centuries, Paris was renowned for its flourishing art scene, characterized particularly by its contributions to the development of painting, sculpture, and architecture. This period, which spans both the late Renaissance and Baroque eras, saw Paris emerge as a pivotal center for artistic innovation and creativity.

In painting, Paris was influential in the spread of Mannerism and later Baroque styles. French painters, inspired by Italian masters such as Raphael and Michelangelo, began to develop a distinctive style that merged Italian techniques with their own cultural themes. One key figure of this period was François Clouet, known for his detailed portraits that captured the elegance of the French court. By the 17th century, artists like Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain became prominent, with Poussin pioneering a classical approach that valued order and clarity, while Lorrain became famous for his idyllic and atmospheric landscapes.

Sculpture in Paris during this era was marked by its grandeur and intricate detail, often commissioned by royalty and the church to convey power and religious fervor. Jean Goujon was a leading sculptor in the mid-16th century, noted for his work on the Fontaine des Innocents in Paris, exemplifying the delicate and elongated forms typical of French Renaissance sculpture. In the 17th century, the Baroque influence became more pronounced, with sculptors such as François Girardon creating dynamic and dramatic works, notably in the gardens of Versailles under the patronage of Louis XIV.

Architecture also saw significant advancements, with Paris laying foundations for what would become French classicism. The construction of the Louvre's Cour Carrée, begun under King Francis I and later expanded, reflected a shift towards Renaissance ideals of symmetry and proportion blended with French Gothic elements. The 17th century witnessed ambitious projects such as the Palais du Luxembourg, designed by architect Salomon de Brosse, and the establishment of the French Academy of Architecture under Louis XIV’s reign. This period also witnessed the initial phases of the transformation of Versailles from a modest hunting lodge into a vast, opulent palace, embodying the absolute power of the monarchy and the grandeur of French Baroque architecture.

"Within the city there have been two tram networks in operation. A proposal to develop a horse-drawn tram (linking the city's railway termini) was made by American George Francis Train in the 1860s, and implemented in 1872 by the Cork Tramway Company. However, the company ceased trading in 1875 after Cork Corporation refused permission to extend the line, mainly because of objections from cab operators to the type of tracks which – although they were laid to the Irish national railway gauge of 5 ft 3in – protruded from the road surface.[citation needed]",Who wanted to develop a horse drawn tram system?,George Francis Train,3,HUM,"Who wanted to develop a horse drawn tram system?

Relevant context: In the mid-19th century, the burgeoning urban centers of Europe and North America faced transportation challenges due to rapid population growth and industrialization. This environment fostered a keen interest in developing efficient public transit systems. Among various proposals, the concept of a horse-drawn tram system gained traction, notably championed by British engineer and inventor George Francis Train. 

Train, originally from the United States, was a visionary entrepreneur who traveled extensively and took a keen interest in improving urban transportation. In the early 1860s, after witnessing the challenges faced by pedestrians and carriages alike on congested city streets, he proposed the establishment of horse-drawn tramways. These trams, unlike omnibuses, would run on metal tracks embedded into the road, allowing for a smoother and more reliable ride. Train believed that such a system would not only alleviate traffic congestion but also provide a more comfortable and efficient means of transportation for city dwellers.

His efforts culminated in the construction of one of the first horse-drawn tramways in Europe, trialed in cities such as London and Liverpool. These initiatives demonstrated the viability of tram systems and laid the groundwork for future electrified streetcars. Train's initial attempts in England weren't without controversy; he faced legal challenges regarding rail installation on public roads, but his perseverance helped to eventually validate the concept of tram systems.

In addition to his work in Europe, Train also contributed to the development of similar systems in the United States. His most notable venture there was the establishment of a horse-drawn streetcar line in New Orleans in 1861, which proved highly successful and ignited interest in tram networks across the country.

George Francis Train's enthusiasm and pioneering efforts played a crucial role in the adoption and improvement of urban transportation systems in the 19th century, marking him as one of the key figures in advocating for horse-drawn trams.

"In sheer numbers, Kerry had fewer endorsements than Howard Dean, who was far ahead in the superdelegate race going into the Iowa caucuses in January 2004, although Kerry led the endorsement race in Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, South Carolina, New Mexico and Nevada. Kerry's main perceived weakness was in his neighboring state of New Hampshire and nearly all national polls. Most other states did not have updated polling numbers to give an accurate placing for the Kerry campaign before Iowa. Heading into the primaries, Kerry's campaign was largely seen as in trouble, particularly after he fired campaign manager Jim Jordan. The key factors enabling it to survive were when fellow Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy assigned Mary Beth Cahill to be the campaign manager, as well as Kerry's mortgaging his own home to lend the money to his campaign (while his wife was a billionaire, campaign finance rules prohibited using one's personal fortune).

"The first phase of neoclassicism in France is expressed in the ""Louis XVI style"" of architects like Ange-Jacques Gabriel (Petit Trianon, 1762–68); the second phase, in the styles called Directoire and ""Empire"", might be characterized by Jean Chalgrin's severe astylar Arc de Triomphe (designed in 1806). In England the two phases might be characterized first by the structures of Robert Adam, the second by those of Sir John Soane. The interior style in France was initially a Parisian style, the ""Goût grec"" (""Greek style"") not a court style. Only when the young king acceded to the throne in 1771 did Marie Antoinette, his fashion-loving Queen, bring the ""Louis XVI"" style to court.",Structure of whom characterize England's second phase of neoclassical?,Sir John Soane,3,HUM,"Structure of whom characterize England's second phase of neoclassical?

Relevant context: The second phase of neoclassical architecture in England, which flourished from the late 18th century into the early 19th century, is characterized by a refined classical style, marked by a more rigorous adherence to classical principles and an emphasis on grandeur and symmetry. This period witnessed the rise of prominent architects who significantly shaped the architectural landscape of England.

Among the most influential figures of this phase was Sir John Soane, whose work epitomized the age’s neoclassical ideals. Soane, an innovator in space and light, is renowned for his distinctive use of domes, lightwells, and complex spatial arrangements. His designs exemplify the transition from Palladianism to neoclassicism, marked by a preference for clean lines, clear forms, and the use of symbolic classical motifs. The Dulwich Picture Gallery and his own residence, now the Sir John Soane's Museum in London, remain testaments to his architectural genius.

Furthermore, the Adam brothers—Robert and James Adam—played a pivotal role in defining this era’s neoclassicism, often referred to as the ""Adamesque"" style. Their work was characterized by a keen attention to interior design, integrating architecture with ornate furniture, ceilings, and fixtures to create harmonious spaces. Notable projects by the Adams include the interiors of Syon House and Kenwood House, where the synthesis of classical architecture with ornamental yet restrained detailing is evident.

Landscape designer Humphry Repton also contributed to this period by incorporating neoclassical principles in his garden designs. Repton popularized the use of ""Red Books,"" in which he outlined his landscape proposals, blending classical architecture with pastoral scenery, exemplifying a holistic approach to design.

In summary, the second phase of English neoclassical architecture is defined by a shift towards purity in classical form, a sense of restrained grandeur, and a comprehensive integration of architectural and interior elements, prominently shaped by figures such as Sir John Soane, Robert and James Adam, and Humphry Repton.

"The territory of modern-day Mexico was home to numerous indigenous civilizations prior to the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores: The Olmecs, who flourished from between 1200 BCE to about 400 BCE in the coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico; the Zapotecs and the Mixtecs, who held sway in the mountains of Oaxaca and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; the Maya in the Yucatan (and into neighbouring areas of contemporary Central America); the Purépecha in present-day Michoacán and surrounding areas, and the Aztecs/Mexica, who, from their central capital at Tenochtitlan, dominated much of the centre and south of the country (and the non-Aztec inhabitants of those areas) when Hernán Cortés first landed at Veracruz.",Who held sway in the mountains of Oaxaca?,the Zapotecs and the Mixtecs,3,HUM,"Who held sway in the mountains of Oaxaca?

Relevant context: Throughout the expansive and rugged terrain of the Oaxacan mountains in southern Mexico, the Zapotec civilization held significant sway for centuries. Flourishing between 500 BCE and 900 CE, the Zapotecs established a sophisticated society, complete with advancements in architecture, astronomy, and a unique script that remains partially undeciphered. They built their most notable city, Monte Albán, atop the central mountains, with impressive terraced structures, ceremonial sites, and tombs that demonstrated their advanced engineering and social organization. This city served not only as a political and ceremonial center but also as an economic hub that directed the flow of goods and ideas across the region.

The Zapotecs had a hierarchical society governed by a powerful priest-king known as a ""Gocquitao,"" who presided over religious rituals and made political decisions. Their religion, which played a central role in their society, involved deities such as Cocijo, the god of rain, and Pitao Cozobi, the corn god, reflecting the importance of agriculture to their subsistence and culture.

During the Post-Classic period, from around 900 CE onward, the influence of the Zapotecs waned, and the Mixtecs began to rise to prominience in the area. Known for their intricate metalwork and vibrant codices, the Mixtecs expanded their influence throughout the Oaxacan highlands. They adopted some Zapotec cultural elements, including aspects of their religious practices and calendar system, yet distinguished themselves through their own contributions, such as extraordinary artistry in turquoise mosaics and goldsmithing.

By the time of the Spanish conquest in the 16th century, the region was a tapestry of different indigenous groups, though the legacy of the Zapotecs and Mixtecs was still deeply embedded in the cultural landscape of Oaxaca.

It is from this town that the county of Hampshire gets its name.",What county in England was named after Hampton?,Hampshire,3,HUM,"What county in England was named after Hampton?

Relevant context: The county in England named after Hampton is Hampshire. The origin of the name traces back to the Old English term ""Hamtun,"" which referred to a settlement or farm. Over time, the name evolved into ""Southampton"" to distinguish it from other settlements with similar names, such as ""Northampton."" The designation ""Hampshire"" literally means ""the shire or county of Hamtun"" and historically referred to the region administered from among these settlements.

Hampshire, located on the southern coast of England, is one of the oldest recorded counties in England, with a rich history dating back to the early Middle Ages. It is bordered by Dorset to the west, Wiltshire to the north-west, Berkshire to the north, Surrey to the north-east, and West Sussex to the east. The southern boundary of Hampshire is formed by the coastline along the English Channel, and it includes the vibrant maritime cities of Southampton and Portsmouth, which are both significant in naval and commercial history.

Notably, Hampshire was the departure point for several significant voyages in history, including the Mayflower, which carried the Pilgrims to North America in 1620. Today, the county is renowned for its natural beauty, featuring the New Forest National Park and part of the South Downs National Park, and for being a place of historical and cultural interest, including historical sites such as Winchester, a former capital of England, and its famous cathedral.

"In styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic, street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork. The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French Invader. He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles, the first of which are small ""traditional"" tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character, installed in cities across the globe, and the second of which are a style he refers to as ""Rubikcubism"", which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik's Cubes. Although he is the most prominent, other street and urban artists do work in Mosaic styles as well.",The French invader coined his own style of mosaic named what?,Rubikcubism,3,HUM,"The French invader coined his own style of mosaic named what?

Relevant context: The French invader in question is likely referring to Napoleon Bonaparte, who led numerous military campaigns throughout Europe in the early 19th century. During his reign as Emperor of France, Napoleon not only altered the political landscape of Europe but also influenced its cultural and artistic realms. One particular contribution to the world of art, though less commonly discussed, is his impact on the domain of mosaics.

Napoleon's influence in the arts was vast, but when it comes to the style of mosaic attributed to him, we look at a more niche cultural effect. The specific term for a mosaic style purportedly linked to Napoleon or the Napoleonic era has not been widely recognized historically, as mosaic art has traditionally been dominated by styles from ancient Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic influences.

Nonetheless, for the sake of this exercise, we could consider that a hypothetical ""Napoleonic Mosaic"" style might be characterized by several distinct features reflective of the traits common in the art and culture patronized during Napoleon’s rule. This would include the use of strong and vibrant colors, much like the Empire style architecture and decor that defined the Napoleonic era. There might also be an emphasis on power and conquest as thematic elements, with motifs celebrating Napoleon’s military achievements, such as wreaths, eagles, or laurel leaves, being integrated into the designs. Similarly, this style might incorporate classical Roman symbols, as Napoleon frequently associated himself with the grandeur of ancient Rome.

In creating this hypothetical style, artisans during Napoleon's time might have also used materials popular in early 19th-century France, perhaps with a shift towards more uniform and geometrically precise tesserae, reflecting the era's ambition of rationality and order. To solidify this style's connection to the Napoleonic era, the mosaics might have been utilized in the grand constructions of the time, such as palatial floors or public monuments glorifying his reign.

While there is no documented or widely accepted mosaic style specifically called the ""Napoleonic Mosaic,"" Napoleon's rule indeed left a rich legacy on the arts, and it is conceivable that his influence would have reached even the craft of mosaic creation, inspiring unique stylistic interpretations reflective of his time.",459.0,1605.0,2124,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.640497922897339,0.9624876976013184,7.53271222114563,Rubikcubism,1.0

The climb was organized by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, a Swiss geologist, and physicist whose passion for mountains and natural sciences drove him to orchestrate a series of attempts to reach the summit of Mont Blanc.

De Saussure, having offered a reward since 1760 to anyone who could find a practical route to Mont Blanc's summit, was determined to make the climb himself after the initial successful ascent by Jacques Balmat and Michel-Gabriel Paccard in 1786, and the second ascent accomplished by Balmat and others in 1787. On the third ascent, alongside Jean-Michel Cachat and de Saussure, the team included several other Chamonix guides whose local knowledge and mountaineering expertise were essential for the climb.

The team's preparation was meticulous, involving careful planning and coordination, emphasizing safety and successful navigation of the harsh alpine conditions. De Saussure's scientific inclination led him to conduct various experiments and observations during the climb, particularly concerning atmospheric pressure and temperature changes at high altitudes, thus contributing valuable data to the fledgling field of mountain meteorology.

This ascent not only marked a personal triumph for de Saussure, who finally realized his ambition of standing atop Western Europe's highest peak, but it also underscored the growing popularity of alpine exploration in the late 18th century, inspiring further climbs and scientific exploration in the region. Jean-Michel Cachat's role exemplified the critical contributions of local guides whose experience and expertise were instrumental in navigating the challenges presented by such formidable natural landscapes.",415.0,1536.0,2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.761693954467773,1.0095164775848389,7.847013473510742,Horace-Bénédict de Saussure,0.5
"By 1860, Houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton. Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston, where they met rail lines to the ports of Galveston and Beaumont. During the American Civil War, Houston served as a headquarters for General John Bankhead Magruder, who used the city as an organization point for the Battle of Galveston. After the Civil War, Houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of Galveston.

Relevant context: Houston played a pivotal role as an organizational point during the Texas Revolution, particularly for the Battle of San Jacinto, which occurred on April 21, 1836. As the revolution unfolded, Houston, a rapidly growing settlement in Texas, became an essential hub due to its strategic location and resources. 

In the weeks leading up to the battle, General Sam Houston, the leader of the Texan army, utilized the area around Houston to gather troops, secure supplies, and plan the offensive against the Mexican forces, led by General Antonio López de Santa Anna. The settlement's proximity to the Buffalo Bayou and its connections to other Texan territories provided an advantageous position for mobilization and communication.

As word spread of the advancing Mexican army, volunteers flocked to Houston, eager to join the fight for Texan independence. The makeshift encampments echoed with the sounds of military preparations, from the clattering of weapons being assembled to the buzz of strategizing officers. Given Houston's logistical advantages, it served as an ideal staging ground for organizing the dispersed Texan forces before they moved southeast to engage the Mexican troops at San Jacinto.

The successful utilization of Houston as an organizational point was instrumental in the decisive victory at the Battle of San Jacinto, which ultimately led to Texas gaining independence from Mexico.

"Paris was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: Manet, Monet, Berthe Morisot, Gauguin, Renoir and others. The French Revolution and political and social change in France had a profound influence on art in the capital. Paris was central to the development of Romanticism in art, with painters such as Gericault. Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in Paris. In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves. Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and many others became associated with Paris.

The city’s architecture, exemplified by the construction of Brunelleschi's dome on the Florence Cathedral, also reflects this extraordinary period of artistic production. The convergence of talented individuals and the support for art in Florence not only produced masterpieces but also set new standards in art and humanism, influencing the course of Western art for centuries.

Meanwhile, Paris emerged as a vibrant artistic center during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Known as the Belle Époque, this era saw an explosion of creativity and experimentation, with Paris at its heart. The city attracted artists, writers, and musicians from all over the world seeking inspiration and collaboration. Impressionists like Monet and Renoir, Post-Impressionists like Van Gogh and Cézanne, and later modernists like Picasso and Matisse made Paris their home. The flourishing café culture, galleries, and exhibitions provided artists with venues for displaying their work and exchanging ideas.

Relevant context: On December 12, 1911, a significant announcement was made during the Delhi Durbar, an event held to commemorate the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary as the Emperor and Empress of India. It was on this day that King George V declared that the capital of British India would be moved from Calcutta (now Kolkata) to Delhi. This strategic decision was influenced by several factors, including Delhi's historical significance as a former capital of various Indian empires and its strategic central location, which was more accessible for governing the vast territory of India.

The move was also partly motivated by a desire to quell the growing nationalist sentiments in Bengal, as Calcutta had become a hotbed of political activism. By relocating the capital, the British administration sought to establish a new seat of power that was both geographically central and symbolically distinct from the fraught political climate of Bengal.

The announcement at the Delhi Durbar was met with a mix of reactions; while some saw it as a prestigious recognition of Delhi's historical prominence, others viewed it as a politically expedient maneuver by the British to maintain control over the subcontinent. Following the announcement, extensive planning and construction were undertaken to build New Delhi, which was officially inaugurated as the capital in 1931.

"Victoria visited mainland Europe regularly for holidays. In 1889, during a stay in Biarritz, she became the first reigning monarch from Britain to set foot in Spain when she crossed the border for a brief visit. By April 1900, the Boer War was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable. Instead, the Queen went to Ireland for the first time since 1861, in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war. In July, her second son Alfred (""Affie"") died; ""Oh, God! My poor darling Affie gone too"", she wrote in her journal.

The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726–9; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796–1800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861–62. The site is now occupied by the Lloyd's building.",between 1638 and 1648 what street was EIC headquarters on?,Leadenhall Street,3,LOC,"between 1638 and 1648 what street was EIC headquarters on?

Relevant context: Between 1638 and 1648, the headquarters of the East India Company (EIC) was located on Leadenhall Street in London, England. The EIC, which was officially founded in 1600 under a royal charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I, initially conducted its meetings and managed its business operations from various rented quarters in the City of London. By the early 1630s, the company had outgrown its previous premises and sought a location that could accommodate its expanding activities and staff.

Leadenhall Street was a strategic choice, nestled in the bustling commercial heart of London. This area was well-known for its proximity to key financial institutions, merchants' homes, and the Royal Exchange, making it an ideal location for the East India Company to conduct its trading operations and communications with other businesses and government officials. The site likely offered a prestigious address that enhanced the company's reputation and facilitated interactions with chartered ships' captains, diplomats, and investors—an essential aspect for an organization that played a significant role in global trade.

During this period, the EIC was focused on developing its trading routes to the East Indies, enhancing its naval capabilities, and managing its growing network of factories (trading posts) across Asia. Leadenhall Street would serve as the nerve center for planning these expansive ventures, issuing directives, and organizing meetings with shareholders and shipowners.

Architecturally, the building on Leadenhall Street that housed the EIC headquarters would have been consistent with the other commercial edifices of the time, likely featuring a combination of timber and brickwork, with interiors designed to accommodate the company's increasing clerical needs. Historical records from the mid-17th century indicate that Leadenhall Street and its vicinity were significant hubs of mercantile and administrative activity, further underscoring the importance of this location for the EIC during this decade.

Relevant context: When considering the affiliation of supporters' clubs to Arsenal Football Club, it’s important to distinguish between official and unofficial supporters' groups. Official supporters’ clubs typically have direct ties to the club and enjoy certain benefits, such as priority tickets, organized events, and exclusive access to the club's communications. These ties can manifest in the form of official recognition by Arsenal, listing on the club's website, or direct engagement with Arsenal's fan outreach programs.

On the other hand, more loosely tied supporters' clubs are generally unofficial groups that may have formed organically, often founded by passionate fans who are geographically distant from the club’s core base in North London. These clubs operate independently of the official structures of Arsenal FC and typically organize their own gatherings without direct support or recognition from the club. While they may still show immense loyalty to Arsenal and contribute to the fan community, their lack of formal association means their activities are more grassroots in nature. Examples of such loosely affiliated groups might include international Arsenal fan networks or regional gatherings that have not pursued official status.

These unofficial clubs often foster a sense of community by organizing match viewings and social events—efforts funded and managed solely through member contributions rather than any formal support from Arsenal FC. They may opt for a more flexible membership structure, inviting fans of all levels of commitment and allowing participation without the formalities tied to official registration.

In summary, while both types of supporters' clubs show unwavering support for Arsenal, unofficial groups may forge a looser connection, characterized by their autonomous nature and self-sustained activity.

"In response to attribution of recent climate change, the City of Melbourne, in 2002, set a target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2020 and Moreland City Council established the Zero Moreland program, however not all metropolitan municipalities have followed, with the City of Glen Eira notably deciding in 2009 not to become carbon neutral. Melbourne has one of the largest urban footprints in the world due to its low density housing, resulting in a vast suburban sprawl, with a high level of car dependence and minimal public transport outside of inner areas. Much of the vegetation within the city are non-native species, most of European origin, and in many cases plays host to invasive species and noxious weeds. Significant introduced urban pests include the common myna, feral pigeon, brown rat, European wasp, common starling and red fox. Many outlying suburbs, particularly towards the Yarra Valley and the hills to the north-east and east, have gone for extended periods without regenerative fires leading to a lack of saplings and undergrowth in urbanised native bushland. The Department of Sustainability and Environment partially addresses this problem by regularly burning off. Several national parks have been designated around the urban area of Melbourne, including the Mornington Peninsula National Park, Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park and Point Nepean National Park in the south east, Organ Pipes National Park to the north and Dandenong Ranges National Park to the east. There are also a number of significant state parks just outside Melbourne. Responsibility for regulating pollution falls under the jurisdiction of the EPA Victoria and several local councils. Air pollution, by world standards, is classified as being good. Summer and autumn are the worst times of year for atmospheric haze in the urban area.",Does Melbourne have one of the largest or smallest carbon footprints in the world?,largest,3,LOC,"Does Melbourne have one of the largest or smallest carbon footprints in the world?

Relevant context: Melbourne is a prominent city in Australia known for its vibrant culture, bustling economic activities, and growing population. When it comes to measuring its carbon footprint, several factors must be considered, including industrial activity, transportation, energy production, and policy initiatives.

As of recent studies, Melbourne's carbon footprint is significant but not among the largest in the world. Major cities such as Beijing, New York, and Tokyo typically have much larger carbon footprints due to their vast industrial bases and larger populations. Melbourne, however, does face substantial challenges related to its carbon emissions, especially in terms of its reliance on coal-fired power plants common across Australia, and a rapidly growing urban population that increases demand for transport and energy.

Melbourne has been proactive in addressing these challenges. The city has implemented various sustainability initiatives aimed at reducing its carbon emissions, aligning with broader national and international efforts to combat climate change. For instance, Melbourne's government has committed to ambitious targets, such as striving to be a carbon-neutral city with initiatives that include enhancing public transportation, increasing energy efficiency in buildings, and promoting renewable energy sources like solar and wind.

Furthermore, the city has plans to improve green infrastructure, which includes increasing the number of urban trees and expanding parks to naturally offset carbon emissions. These efforts are part of Melbourne's broader commitment to the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, which involves collaboration with other major cities around the world to share best practices and contribute to global emission reduction efforts.

While Melbourne is not at the extreme end of carbon footprints for major global cities, its efforts to mitigate its environmental impact are noteworthy. It faces a middling position where proactive policy and sustainable urban planning could substantially influence its carbon footprint relative to other global cities. Therefore, understanding Melbourne's carbon footprint involves not only considering its current emissions but also recognizing the active steps it is taking toward a more sustainable future.",386.0,1718.0,2163,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.690457105636597,2.50752592086792,9.181625127792358,Largest,1.0

"The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary. The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of New Jersey. The East River—a tidal strait—flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County, is the only entirely fresh water river in the city.",Which river seperates The Bronx from Manhatten?,The Harlem River,3,LOC,"Which river seperates The Bronx from Manhatten?

Relevant context: The Harlem River is the body of water that separates The Bronx from Manhattan. This tidal strait in New York City is approximately 7.2 miles (11.6 kilometers) long and provides a natural division between the two boroughs. The Harlem River flows in a generally northward direction from the East River at the southern tip of The Bronx and wraps around the northern edge of Manhattan to the western end of the Bronx, where it meets the Hudson River.

Historically, the Harlem River has been an important waterway for commerce and transportation. Various bridges span the Harlem River, including well-known crossings such as the Willis Avenue Bridge, the Robert F. Kennedy (formerly Triborough) Bridge, and the Washington Bridge, which facilitate the movement of people and goods between The Bronx and Manhattan. The river's strategic location has made it a crucial component of the city's infrastructure.

In terms of geography, the Harlem River is relatively narrow compared to other rivers and straits in New York City. Its existence is vital in characterizing the physical boundaries and identities of The Bronx and Manhattan. The river not only marks a division in terms of boroughs but also historically in terms of neighborhoods and socioeconomic conditions. Despite these boundaries, the connectivity provided by multiple bridges has integrated the two areas significantly.

Overall, the Harlem River is more than just a geographic divide; it is a fundamental part of the urban landscape of New York City, with both historical significance and contemporary importance.",304.0,1372.0,1733,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.742191553115845,1.1729373931884766,6.854018926620483,Harlem River,0.8

Relevant context: In the early colonial period, the settlement at Plymouth, established by the Pilgrims in 1620, was a small but growing community. The question of household size in this context can be informed by examining both historical records and demographic trends of the time. Records from the Plymouth Colony indicate that the household structures were primarily familial, with a typical household consisting of nuclear family units, occasionally supplemented by relatives or indentured servants when available.

During the 17th century, the average number of people living in a Plymouth household was about six to eight individuals. This estimate includes parents with their children and sometimes extended family members such as a grandparent or a few non-relatives who were part of the household due to labor arrangements or community support systems. This arrangement was influenced by several factors, including high birth rates, the necessity of larger family units for agricultural and household labor, and the communal aspects of early colonial life which sometimes necessitated smaller community sizes per dwelling.

The household structure in Plymouth, like other early English colonies in North America, evolved partly due to the high mortality rates and the need for mutual support and collaboration in the demanding new environment. These conditions often resulted in fluid household compositions, with members joining or leaving the household as dictated by marriages, deaths, or economic needs.

It is important to note that household sizes varied considerably, with some prosperous or influential colonists accommodating a larger number of individuals, including servants and apprentices, thus reflecting their socioeconomic status. However, the predominant household model remained focused on family-centered living arrangements catering to both economic productivity and community stability.

For historians and demographers, these insights into Plymouth household sizes not only shed light on the social and economic structures of early colonial life but also provide a baseline for understanding the demographic changes and cultural adaptations that occurred as the colony evolved.",375.0,1603.0,2036,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.642732620239258,1.074634313583374,5.739246368408203,2.50,0.0

Relevant context: In the city of Bern, which is the de facto capital of Switzerland, the majority of individuals completing tertiary schooling are predominantly Swiss nationals. This trend can be attributed to several factors, including the country's robust education system and the cultural emphasis on higher education. 

Switzerland, renowned for its esteemed universities and technical schools, draws a significant number of international students. However, local students form the bulk of the graduating population because of the structured pathways available for Swiss citizens from compulsory education to tertiary institutions. The Swiss education system is diverse, with options ranging from universities to universities of applied sciences and advanced vocational education.

In Bern, statistics suggest that a large proportion of the graduates are native Bernese, or individuals from other cantons who have moved to the city for education. This reflects the regional accessibility and affordability of higher education for Swiss residents. Additionally, bilingual programs in German and French, the official languages of Bern, facilitate the participation of local students. 

While international students contribute to the diversity of the academic environment, often excelling in postgraduate and research roles, the completion rates for tertiary education are predominantly seen among Swiss individuals, partly due to immigration and employment policies that may influence non-nationals' length of stay.

"The 1920s, with tourism at its peak, are considered by many historians as Atlantic City's golden age.

It was during Prohibition that racketeer and political boss Enoch L. ""Nucky"" Johnson rose to power. Prohibition was largely unenforced in Atlantic City, and, because alcohol that had been smuggled into the city with the acquiescence of local officials could be readily obtained at restaurants and other establishments, the resort's popularity grew further. The city then dubbed itself as ""The World's Playground"".

Relevant context: Prohibition in the United States was a significant period in American history that officially began with the ratification of the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This amendment was ratified on January 16, 1919, and took effect on January 17, 1920. Prohibition specifically aimed to prohibit the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages, marking a monumental shift in national policy fueled by the temperance movement.

The National Prohibition Act, commonly known as the Volstead Act, was enacted to provide the legal framework necessary to enforce the 18th Amendment. The intent behind Prohibition was to reduce crime, corruption, social problems, and the tax burden created by prisons and poorhouses, as well as to improve health and hygiene in America. However, the results were quite mixed, leading to widespread illegal activities such as bootlegging, speakeasies, and the rise of organized crime.

Despite its initial intentions, Prohibition became increasingly unpopular, and numerous voices criticized its adverse effects on society and the economy. This growing disfavor culminated in the passage of the 21st Amendment, which repealed the 18th Amendment. The 21st Amendment was ratified on December 5, 1933, effectively bringing Prohibition to an end.

Thus, Prohibition in the United States lasted for nearly 14 years, from January 17, 1920, until December 5, 1933.

Relevant context: The region of Tuscany, celebrated for its rolling hills, rich art history, and vibrant culture, has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Evidence of human presence in Tuscany dates back to at least 40,000 years ago during the Paleolithic era. These early humans were likely attracted to the region's natural resources, mild climate, and fertile lands.

However, when considering Tuscany's ""first visitors"" in the context of historical civilizations, we must look to the Etruscans, who began settling in the area around 900 BCE. These people, whose origins are still subject to scholarly debate, laid much of the foundational culture and infrastructure of the region. By 700 BCE, the Etruscan civilization had established significant settlements throughout Tuscany, notably cities like Veii, Tarquinia, and Vulci, playing a pivotal role in the development of not only the region but also in the broader cultural landscape of ancient Italy.

The Etruscans developed advanced urban settlements and engaged extensively in trade with neighboring peoples, including the Greeks and Phoenicians, making them among the early ""visitors"" who had a lasting impact. Their rich legacy is evident in Tuscan art, language, and architecture and set the stage for the later Roman expansion.

Therefore, while human occupation of the region goes back tens of millennia, the first ""visitors"" with a recorded historical influence in Tuscany can be traced to the Etruscan civilization approximately 2,900 years ago.

Relevant context: Napoleon Bonaparte, who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and subsequently crowned himself Emperor of France, experienced the pinnacle of his power in the early 19th century before facing a series of military defeats that led to his downfall. Napoleon's abdication occurred on April 6, 1814, marking a significant turning point in European history.

Leading up to this event, Napoleon's forces suffered a critical loss during the War of the Sixth Coalition, which culminated in the fall of Paris to the allied forces on March 31, 1814. With his armies weakened and his political support crumbling, Napoleon faced mounting pressure both from foreign adversaries and internal factions to relinquish his authority.

The declaration of abdication was formalized at the Fontainebleau Palace, where Napoleon resigned in favor of his son, though the allies insisted on a total abdication without conditions. Although initially resistant, Napoleon formally abdicated without condition shortly thereafter, clearing the way for the Bourbon Restoration in the person of Louis XVIII.

Napoleon Bonaparte's abdication on April 6, 1814, effectively ended his reign and led to his exile to the island of Elba.

Relevant context: As of the latest information available, the Premier League, which is the top tier of the English football league system, consists of 20 member clubs. Each of these clubs is effectively a shareholder in the league. This shareholder structure means that all 20 clubs have a vested interest in the operations and governance of the league as they each hold an equal stake. The Premier League operates as a collective of these clubs, and their shareholder status grants them the right to a voice in key decisions—ranging from broadcasting rights deals to the rule changes within the league.

The structure is such that when a club is promoted to the Premier League from the English Football League Championship, it becomes a shareholder by virtue of its membership. Conversely, if a club is relegated to the Championship, it relinquishes its shareholder status upon departing the Premier League, though it may regain this status should it be promoted again. This dynamic nature of club membership and shareholder status ensures that the Premier League's competitive balance and financial interests are maintained through a comprehensive governance framework agreed upon by member clubs.

The revenue generated through television rights deals, sponsorships, and other commercial ventures is distributed among these shareholder clubs, providing a critical financial foundation to support their operations. Club representatives regularly meet to discuss league affairs, shaping the strategic direction of the Premier League, ensuring its growth and success as one of the world's most popular and financially lucrative football leagues.

In total, there are approximately 90 different species of fish found in Montana, a mixture of both native and introduced species. Of these, around 50 are considered to be native to Montana's diverse aquatic habitats, including the iconic Rocky Mountain streams and large prairie rivers.

The state's native fish populations are particularly adapted to their environments, shaped by thousands of years of evolution in Montana's distinct climate and geology. Notable native species include the Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi), which is the state fish of Montana, and was historically found in abundance throughout the Columbia River system and the Missouri River drainage. The Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus), another native species, is known for requiring very cold, clean waters, and is considered a sensitive species due to its specific habitat needs.

Montana is also home to various sucker species, minnows, and sculpins that play critical ecological roles in the state's waterways. The Mountain Whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni) is another native species commonly found in Montana's rivers, serving as an indicator of healthy river ecosystems.

Introduced species, such as the Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Brown Trout (Salmo trutta), have been stocked in many of Montana's waters to enhance recreational fishing opportunities. These introduced species sometimes compete with native fish, which has led to conservation concerns and efforts to protect native populations.

Moreover, Montana's Fish, Wildlife & Parks department actively manages fish populations to maintain ecological balance and biodiversity. Conservation programs aim to restore native species and habitats while managing the introductions to ensure sustainable fishing practices.

Presbyterians, along with Roman Catholics in Ulster and the rest of Ireland, suffered under the discriminatory Penal Laws until they were revoked in the early 19th century. Presbyterianism is represented in Ireland by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, the Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland, the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church.",How many Scottie Presbyterians moved to the northern counties in Ireland?,"100,000",3,NUM,"How many Scottie Presbyterians moved to the northern counties in Ireland?

Relevant context: In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, a significant number of Scottish Presbyterians, often referred to as Scots-Irish or Ulster Scots, migrated to the northern counties of Ireland. This migration was largely driven by a combination of economic, religious, and political factors. Firstly, the economic opportunities in Ulster, particularly in the fields of linen production and farming, attracted many Scots. The land in Ulster was being offered under favorable terms compared to Scotland, which faced economic hardships and overpopulation.

Moreover, the migration was also fueled by religious persecution. The Scottish Presbyterians faced oppressive measures by the English authorities who favored the Anglican Church. As a result, many sought greater religious freedom in the relatively tolerant environment of Ulster, where they could practice their Presbyterian faith more freely.

In terms of numbers, it is estimated that between 1606 and 1697, around 100,000 Scottish Presbyterians relocated to Ulster. This movement continued into the early 18th century as a part of a broader relocation process that saw the transformation of the demographic and cultural landscape of Northern Ireland. Counties such as Antrim, Down, and Armagh became centers of this new Presbyterian population. Within these communities, the Scottish influence grew strong, manifesting in the spread of Presbyterian churches, schools, and cultural practices.

Over time, these migrants and their descendants played a crucial role in shaping the social, economic, and religious life of Northern Ireland. Their legacy remains evident in the cultural and historical fabric of the region today.",327.0,1682.0,2069,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.075585603713989,0.9466924667358398,8.158612728118896,"100,000",1.0
"Mosaic art also flourished in Christian Petra where three Byzantine churches were discovered. The most important one was uncovered in 1990. It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual. The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century. In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed. They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals, and personifications of the Seasons, Ocean, Earth and Wisdom.",When was the most important Byzantine church re-discovered?,in 1990,3,NUM,"When was the most important Byzantine church re-discovered?

Relevant context: The most important Byzantine church is widely considered to be the Hagia Sophia, located in Istanbul, Turkey. The Hagia Sophia was originally constructed between 532 and 537 AD during the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I and served as the world's largest cathedral for nearly a thousand years. It remained a crucial center of Eastern Orthodox Christianity until 1453, when the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople (now Istanbul) and subsequently converted the church into a mosque. In 1935, under the secular reforms of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey, the building was secularized and transformed into a museum.

The ""re-discovery"" of the Hagia Sophia as a Byzantine church, in a more metaphorical sense, occurred over several periods of renewed scholarly and cultural interest. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Western architects, historians, and archaeologists extensively studied its architectural grandeur and historical significance. It became an object of fascination and scholarly attention, particularly for those interested in Byzantine art and architecture, leading to a better understanding of its historical context and artistic contributions.

The Hagia Sophia's most significant re-emergence into global consciousness took place in the late 19th century, as Western scholars began documenting its architecture and interior mosaics in detail. This period marked a broader appreciation and recognition of Byzantine contributions to art and architecture, although not all sections were accessible for review until restorations and studies took place.

Thus, while the literal ""re-discovery"" of the Hagia Sophia never occurred, as it was always known in some capacity, its cultural and historical re-evaluation and appreciation burgeoned in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through scholarly works and public interest. 

In 2020, the status of the Hagia Sophia changed once more as it was officially reconverted into a mosque, while remaining open to visitors of all faiths. Despite this change in its functional role, its historical importance as a bastion of Byzantine architecture and its symbolic significance continues to captivate historians and tourists around the world. This ongoing interest ensures that the legacy of the Hagia Sophia, as an emblematic symbol of Byzantium's architectural and cultural heritage, remains in the global spotlight.",464.0,1655.0,2175,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.591079950332642,0.9524838924407959,6.498663902282715,1453,0.0
