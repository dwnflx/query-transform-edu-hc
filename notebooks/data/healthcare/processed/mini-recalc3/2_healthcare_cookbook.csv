"The etiology of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is still obscure. Data supporting an interaction connecting prostate hyperplasia and immune dysregulation is accumulating lately. The aim of the study was to assess the cellular immune responses to PSA by measuring the in vitro potential of PSA to induce proliferation and cytokine secretion in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of BPH patients. PBLs were extracted from fresh blood of 36 BPH patients and 11 age-matched controls. The PBLs were incubated with PSA. Proliferation of the cultured PBLs was determined by thymidine incorporation. Secretion of cytokines to the culture medium was measured either by biological assay (IL-2) or by ELISA (IL-4, IL-10, IFNgamma, TNFalpha). Twelve of the 36 BPH patients responded to PSA, whereas none of the 11 controls responded (p = 0.04). The proliferative response of PBLs from BPH patients was significantly higher as compared to PBLs of controls (p = 0.03). The mean total prostate volume and the transition zone volume were 51% and 54% bigger, respectively, among the responders to PSA as compared to the nonresponders (p < 0.05), whereas the mean serum PSA level did not differ significantly. PBLs of BPH patients secreted significantly higher levels of TNFalpha, both spontaneously and in response to PSA, as compared to controls (p = 0.003).",Does prostate-specific antigen induce proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and cytokine secretion in benign prostate hypertrophy patients?,"These findings show that PSA is able to induce proliferation of PBLs in vitro in BPH patients. Moreover, the higher spontaneous and PSA-induced secretion of TNFalpha in BPH patients may reflect a role for this proinflammatory cytokine in vivo. Based on these observations, we suggest that autoimmune dysregulation might have a role in BPH.",0,1.

"Platelet-rich plasma is characterized by containing fundamental protein growth factors. Although many in vitro studies have documented the capability of platelet-rich plasma to induce the growth of osteoblasts or osteoblast-like cells, the effect of platelet-rich plasma on osteoclastogenesis has not yet been studied. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of platelet-rich plasma and platelet-poor plasma on osteoclastogenesis with rat bone marrow cell culture. Platelet-rich plasma and platelet-poor plasma were produced from the whole blood of rat. For cell culture, rat bone marrow cells were isolated from rat tibiae and then treated with 1,25alpha dihydroxy vitamin D(3) and with different concentrations of platelet-rich plasma or platelet-poor plasma. After 4 d of culture, rat bone marrow cells were stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), and TRAP-positive cells that had more than three nuclei (TRAP-positive multinucleated cells) were counted as osteoclast-like cells. Osteoprotegerin, known as an osteoclastogenesis-related factor, cells was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although platelet-poor plasma had no effect on the formation of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells, platelet-rich plasma decreased the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells in a dose-dependent manner. The amount of osteoprotegerin produced from rat bone marrow cells and from MC3T3-E1 cells was enhanced in platelet-rich plasma-treated groups.",Does platelet-rich plasma suppress osteoclastogenesis by promoting the secretion of osteoprotegerin?,"Under our experimental conditions, platelet-rich plasma decreased the formation of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells and increased the secretion of osteoprotegerin. This study suggests that platelet-rich plasma suppresses osteoclastogenesis, therefore inhibiting bone resorption.

"Animals respond to inflammation by suppressing normal high-energy activities, including feeding and locomotion, in favor of diverting resources to the immune response. The cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) inhibits normal feeding and locomotor activity (LMA) via its actions in the central nervous system (CNS). Behavioral changes in response to IL-1β are mediated by myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) in non-hematopoietic cells. It is unknown whether IL-1β acts directly on neurons or requires transduction by non-neuronal cells. The Nestin-cre mouse was crossed with MyD88lox mice to delete MyD88 from neurons and glia in the CNS (MyD88ΔCNS). These mice were compared to total body MyD88KO and wild type (WT) mice. Mice had cannulae stereotactically placed in the lateral ventricle and telemetry transponders implanted into the peritoneum. Mice were treated with either intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) IL-1β (10 ng) or vehicle. Food intake, body weight and LMA were continuously monitored for 24 h after treatment. I.c.v. tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a MyD88-independent cytokine, was used to control for normal immune development. Peripheral inflammation was modeled using intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Groups were compared using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. Efficacy of recombination was evaluated using tdTomato reporter mice crossed with the Nestin-cre mouse. MyD88 deletion was confirmed by Western blot. I.c.v. IL-1β treatment caused a significant reduction in feeding, body weight and LMA in WT mice. MyD88KO mice were protected from these changes in response to i.c.v. IL-1β despite having intact behavioral responses to TNF. Cre-mediated recombination was observed in neurons and astrocytes, but not microglia or endothelial cells. In contrast to MyD88KO mice, the behavioral responses of MyD88ΔCNS mice to i.c.v. IL-1β or intraperitoneal (i.p.) LPS were indistinguishable from those of WT mice.",Is expression of myeloid differentiation factor 88 in neurons requisite for the induction of sickness behavior by interleukin-1β?,Sickness behavior is mediated by MyD88 and is dependent on the activity of cytokines within the brain. Our results demonstrate that MyD88 is not required in neurons or astrocytes to induce this behavioral response to IL-1β or LPS. This suggests that a non-Nestin expressing cell population responds to IL-1β in the CNS and transduces the signal to neurons controlling feeding and activity.,0,Is the presence of myeloid differentiation factor 88 in nerve cells essential for the development of illness behavior induced by interleukin-1β?,30.0,2449.0,2641.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.859707593917847,4.256383180618286,7.119440317153931,"The provided context does not specifically address the role of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) in neurons concerning the induction of sickness behavior by interleukin-1β (IL-1β).

"To investigate the role of Rho A and Rho-kinase in acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and the protective effect of Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632 [(R)-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide]. Male CD1 mice were subjected to 30 min of coronary occlusion and 24 h reperfusion. Ischemia/reperfusion upregulated expression of Rho A in ischemic myocardium, and subsequently activated Rho-kinase. Y-27632 significantly inhibited the activation of Rho-kinase following ischemia/reperfusion. Treatment with Y-27632 at 10 and 30 mg/kg oral administration, reduced infarct size by 30.2% and 41.1%, respectively (P<0.01 vs. vehicle). Y-27632 also enhanced post-ischemia cardiac function. Left ventricular systolic pressure, +dP/dt and -dP/dt were significantly improved by 23.5%, 52.3%, and 59.4%, respectively (P<0.01 vs. vehicle). Moreover, Y-27632 reduced ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial apoptosis. The apoptotic myocytes in ischemic myocardium after 4 h reperfusion were reduced from 13.1% in vehicle group to 6.4% in Y-27632-treated group (P<0.01). Meanwhile, ischemia/reperfusion-induced downregulation of Bcl-2 in myocardium was remarkably attenuated in the treated animals. Ischemia/reperfusion resulted in remarkable elevation in serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which was significantly suppressed by Y-27632. In addition, Y-27632 decreased ischemia/reperfusion-induced accumulation of neutrophils in the heart by 45% (P<0.01).",Does inhibition of Rho-kinase protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury?,These results suggest that Rho-kinase plays a pivotal role in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.

"Allergen-mediated cross-linking of IgE on mast cells/basophils is a well-recognized trigger for type 1 allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis (AR). However, allergens may not be the sole trigger for AR, and several allergic-like reactions are induced by non-IgE-mediated mechanisms. We sought to describe a novel non-IgE-mediated, endotoxin-triggered nasal type-1-hypersensitivity-like reaction in mice. To investigate whether endotoxin affects sneezing responses, mice were intraperitoneally immunized with ovalbumin (OVA), then nasally challenged with endotoxin-free or endotoxin-containing OVA.

"The mechanism by which topical isoproterenol protects the gastric mucosa from ethanol-induced injury is unclear; previous studies suggest that enhancement of mucosal blood flow may be contributory. Therefore, we investigated the role of isoproterenol pretreatment on rat gastric mucous gel layer thickness, mucosal blood flow, and surface cell intracellular pH. A portion of the gastric corpus of an anesthetized rat was isolated in a superfused chamber. Intracellular pH was measured with the fluorescent dye 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, mucous gel thickness was measured by quantifying the distance between the focal planes of the epithelial cell and the gel surfaces, and mucosal blood flow was measured in separate experiments with a laser-Doppler flowmeter. Pretreatment with topical isoproterenol markedly increased gastric mucous gel layer thickness, decreased surface cell initial acidification rates, and significantly enhanced the recovery of intracellular pH toward baseline values. Gastric mucosal blood flow was significantly higher in the isoproterenol-treated group compared with untreated controls, initially increasing, decreasing, and then increasing a second time during superfusion with acidic solutions.",Does isoproterenol enhance rat gastric mucosal barrier function in vivo?,"Isoproterenol preserves gastric surface cell intracellular pH during acid superfusion.

"Impaired myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) activity is a hallmark of failing hearts, and SERCA2a gene therapy improves cardiac function in animals and patients with heart failure (HF). Deregulation of microRNAs has been demonstrated in HF pathophysiology. We studied the effects of therapeutic AAV9.SERCA2a gene therapy on cardiac miRNome expression and focused on regulation, expression, and function of miR-1 in reverse remodelled failing hearts. We studied a chronic post-myocardial infarction HF model treated with AAV9.SERCA2a gene therapy. Heart failure resulted in a strong deregulation of the cardiac miRNome. miR-1 expression was decreased in failing hearts, but normalized in reverse remodelled hearts after AAV9.SERCA2a gene delivery. Increased Akt activation in cultured cardiomyocytes led to phosphorylation of FoxO3A and subsequent exclusion from the nucleus, resulting in miR-1 gene silencing. In vitro SERCA2a expression also rescued miR-1 in failing cardiomyocytes, whereas SERCA2a inhibition reduced miR-1 levels. In vivo, Akt and FoxO3A were highly phosphorylated in failing hearts, but reversed to normal by AAV9.SERCA2a, leading to cardiac miR-1 restoration. Likewise, enhanced sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1) expression during HF was normalized by SERCA2a gene therapy.

"Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a condition that has significant impact on the quality of life of children. Although the etiology is multi-factorial, certain risk factors such as an allergic predisposition, daycare, and cigarette smoke exposure contribute to its pathogenesis. (1) To determine whether there is a tendency for children with chronic or recurrent OME (cases) to have higher serum levels of the T-helper 2 cell (Th-2) allergenic-type cytokines, interleukin-4 (IL-4), and IL-5, or the T-helper 1(Th-1) infectious-type cytokines, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), compared to children without a history of recurrent OME (controls) and (2) to determine any possible correlations between the cytokine levels and risk factors associated with OME. We analyzed serum levels of these four cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of 19 cases and 17 controls. Cases, independent of age, had increased levels of serum IL-5 compared to controls (p=0.014). While a significant difference in serum IL-4 levels did not exist between cases and controls, children exposed to cigarette smoke had significantly higher levels of serum IL-4 (p=0.003).

"Microalbuminuria is a risk factor for developing end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular events. Mutations in NPHS2 have been shown to cause autosomal-recessive nephrotic syndrome. Recently, a functional polymorphism of this gene (R229Q) was described and associated with a maturity-onset form of nephrotic syndrome. We have investigated whether the carrier status of this novel genetic variant is associated with microalbuminuria in individuals from the general population. Demographic, cardiovascular risk factors, and renal phenotypes in 1577 individuals from a cross-sectional-based study were collected following the general guidelines of the WHO-MONICA project (monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular diseases).

"Increasing concern has been expressed regarding the potential adverse health effects that may be associated with human exposure to inhaled multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Thus it is imperative that an understanding as to the underlying mechanisms and the identification of the key factors involved in adverse effects are gained. In the alveoli, MWCNTs first interact with the pulmonary surfactant. At this interface, proteins and lipids of the pulmonary surfactant bind to MWCNTs, affecting their surface characteristics. Aim of the present study was to investigate if the pre-coating of MWCNTs with pulmonary surfactant has an influence on potential adverse effects, upon both (i) human monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) monocultures, and (ii) a sophisticated in vitro model of the human epithelial airway barrier. Both in vitro systems were exposed to MWCNTs either pre-coated with a porcine pulmonary surfactant (Curosurf) or not. The effect of MWCNTs surface charge was also investigated in terms of amino (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) surface modifications. Pre-coating of MWCNTs with Curosurf affects their oxidative potential by increasing the reactive oxygen species levels and decreasing intracellular glutathione depletion in MDM as well as decreases the release of Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). In addition, an induction of apoptosis was observed after exposure to Curosurf pre-coated MWCNTs.

Ninety minutes of ischemia and reperfusion was performed in Bcl-2 transgenic and non-transgenic mice. Bcl-2 overexpression was determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Liver injury was determined by aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Tunel test and the activation of the apoptotic cascade and animal survival. Bcl-2 overexpression was present in all hepatocytes and non-parenchymal liver cells in transgenic mice. Bcl-2 overexpression resulted in significant decreased AST levels after ischemic injury, and complete inhibition of apoptosis. After 90 min of total hepatic ischemia all control mice died, while four transgenic mice survived permanently.

"Ischemic stroke causes a high rate of deaths and permanent neurological damage in survivors. Ischemic stroke triggers the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which activate toll-like receptors (TLRs) and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) in the affected area, leading to an exaggerated inflammatory response and cell death. Both TLRs and RAGE are transmembrane pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that have been shown to contribute to ischemic stroke-induced brain injury. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations obtained by fractionating human blood plasma are increasingly being used as an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of several inflammatory diseases. Its use as a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of stroke has been proposed, but little is known about the direct neuroprotective mechanisms of IVIg. We therefore investigate whether IVIg exerts its beneficial effects on the outcome of neuronal injury by modulating HMGB1-induced TLR and RAGE expressions and activations. Primary cortical neurons were subjected to glucose deprivation or oxygen and glucose deprivation conditions and treated with IVIg and recombinant HMGB1. C57/BL6J mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by reperfusion, and IVIg was administered intravenously 3 h after the start of reperfusion. Expression of TLRs, RAGE and downstream signalling proteins in neurons and brain tissues were evaluated by immunoblot. Treatment of cultured neurons with IVIg reduced simulated ischemia-induced TLR2, TLR4, TLR8 and RAGE expressions, pro-apoptotic caspase-3 cleavage and phosphorylation of the cell death-associated kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as well as the p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). These results were recapitulated in an in vivo model of stroke. IVIg treatment also upregulated the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) in cortical neurons under ischemic conditions.

"Both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy have been shown to display dual roles in cell survival in multiple cell lines. There is a reported but poorly understood link between ER stress, autophagy, and cell death. We hypothesized that autophagy plays a role in ER stress-dependent cell death in rat hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes isolated from both lean and obese male Zucker rats were cultured and treated with tunicamycin (TM), tauroursodeoxycholic acid, 3-methyladenine, and wortmannin for 12 h. The ER stress-associated genes glucose-regulated protein 78 and C/EBP homologous protein were examined via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. Immunostaining with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 as well as electron microscopy were used to evaluate autophagy activity. Trypan blue exclusion was used to determine hepatocyte cell viability. In both lean and steatotic hepatocytes, we found that TM induced both C/EBP homologous protein and glucose-regulated protein 78 messenger RNA expression.

"To obtain an insight into the function of cellular prion protein (PrPC), we studied PrPC-interacting proteins (PrPIPs) by analysing a protein microarray. We identified 47 novel PrPIPs by probing an array of 5000 human proteins with recombinant human PrPC spanning amino acid residues 23-231 named PR209. The great majority of 47 PrPIPs were annotated as proteins involved in the recognition of nucleic acids. Coimmunoprecipitation and cell imaging in a transient expression system validated the interaction of PR209 with neuronal PrPIPs, such as FAM64A, HOXA1, PLK3 and MPG. However, the interaction did not generate proteinase K-resistant proteins.

"The role of Daxx, in particular its ability to promote or hinder apoptosis, still remains controversial. In order to elucidate the functional relevance of Daxx in the extrinsic signaling of malignant lymphocytes Jurkat T-cells were stably transfected with a Daxx-expressing vector or with the respective Daxx-negative control vector. Assessing first the impact of Daxx expression on the rate of proliferation we demonstrate that overexpression of Daxx alone is not sufficient to alter proliferation in neoplastic lymphocytes. Nevertheless, expression of Daxx down-regulates anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and up-regulates pro-apoptotic BID. In addition, Daxx-overexpressing Jurkat cells exhibit a decreased expression of the pro-caspase-8, -10, -9 and -3 and a concomitant increase of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins survivin, XIAP, cIAP-1 and -2.

"Critical illness in cirrhotic patients is associated with a poor prognosis and increased susceptibility to infections. Monocyte HLA-DR expression is decreased in cirrhotic patients, but its prognostic value has not been investigated prospectively. Thirty-eight critically ill patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis were included in this prospective study. On admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein), interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-gamma serum levels, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha ex vivo stimulation (whole blood assay) and HLA-DR expression on monocytes (FACS analysis) were determined. Immune parameters were furthermore measured every third day until discharge from the ICU or death of the patients. Intensive care unit mortality of the cirrhotic patients was 34.2%. During admission, TNF ex vivo, IFN-gamma and HLA-DR expression were lower in non-survivors (all P<0.05), while IL-10 levels were increased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P=0.001). However, individual values clearly overlapped between groups. Prospective analysis revealed that monocyte HLA-DR expression remained stable or increased in survivors, but decreased in non-survivors (P=0.002). A decrease in HLA-DR expression between admission and day 3 was strongly associated with decreased IFN-gamma levels and increased ICU mortality (hazard ratio 3.36, P=0.008), mostly owing to late sepsis.

"To investigate the potential effects of berberine on renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) of obstructed kidneys in a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) rat model. Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham-operated, vehicle-treated UUO, and berberine-treated UUO. Rats were gavaged with berberine (200 mg/kg per day) or vehicle. Eight randomly chosen rats in each group were kiled and specimens were collected at day 14 after UUO. Physiological parameters and histological changes were assessed, RIF was evaluated using Masson's trichrome and Sirius red staining, oxidative stress and inflammation markers were determined, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were measured using immunohistochemistry or western blotting analysis. The obstruction was relieved at day 14 by percutaneous nephrostomy in the remaining UUO rats. The resistive index of left kidneys was undertaken by coloured Doppler flow imaging at day 14 before nephrostomy and day 7 after the relief. Berberine treatment significantly attenuated RIF induced by UUO. The UUO-induced reduction in kidney superoxide dismutase and catalase activities increased, whereas elevated kidney malondialdehyde level markedly decreased. Berberine treatment significantly ameliorated UUO-induced inflammation, and decreased TGF-β1, pSmad3 and α-SMA expression of UUO kidneys.

"To investigate whether the normal expression of metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) in Sertoli cells (SCs) is associated with adjacent germ cells (GCs) and to provide the functional relevance of MTA1 in this somatic cell. The expression pattern of MTA1 in the SCs of impaired human spermatogenesis was determined using immunohistochemistry. The effect of the depletion of GCs on the expression of MTA1 in isolated SCs was evaluated using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in murine testes treated with busulphan. Finally, using multiple assays, the functional investigation of MTA1 by its specific knockdown was performed in SC-GC co-cultures. SCs were negatively immunolabeled in the tubules with impaired spermatogenesis. Depletion of murine GCs by treatment with busulphan resulted in a dramatic decrease of the MTA1 transcripts level in the isolated SCs on the 15th day of treatment and thereafter had totally abolished MTA1 expression by the 30th day of treatment, respectively.

"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are key mediators of inflammation and their increased plasma levels are associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Polymorphisms in the promoter region of IL-6 (-174 G>C) and TNF-alpha (-308 G>A) demonstrated to affect gene expression were analyzed to test their predictive power for cardiovascular death over one year follow-up in elderly male ACS patients. We assessed the IL-6 -174 G>C polymorphism and TNF-alpha -308 G>A polymorphism in 139 consecutive elderly male patients affected by an ACS, such as ST-Elevation (STEMI), No ST-Elevation (NSTEMI) Myocardial Infarction and Unstable Angina. The presence of well known risk factors for Coronary Heart Diseases (CHD) were also assessed in all ACS patients. Survival rate was assessed after one year follow-up.

Levels of amylase, α-tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, thromboxane B2 and 6-keto- prostaglandin F1α were measured both before and after the induction of SAP. Pathologic examination of the pancreas and kidneys was performed after termination of the study. Pathologic changes noted in the pancreas in SAP significantly improved following CRAI with either single or combined administration of 5-Fu and Oct, where combination therapy demonstrated the lowest injury score. All treatment groups had significantly lower levels of serum TNF-α and amylase activity (P<0.05), though only groups D and E had a lower BUN level as compared to group B. The plasma thromboxane B(2) level increased in SAP, but the ratio of thromboxane B(2)/6-keto- prostaglandin F(1α) decreased in the treatment groups, with the combination therapy (group E) demonstrating the lowest ratio as compared to the other 3 experimental groups (P<0.05).",Does continuous regional arterial infusion with fluorouracil and octreotide attenuate severe acute pancreatitis in a canine model?,"The findings in the present study demonstrate an attenuation of SAP in a canine model following CRAI administration with 5-Fu or Oct, alone or in combination.",0,1.

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is still one of the most fatal cancers, although its prognosis has improved recently with the introduction of multimodal therapy. To further develop effective treatment for PDAC, establishment of prognostic indicators for patients receiving multimodal therapy is essential. Sixty-eight patients receiving curative extended resection combined with preoperative chemoradiation and postoperative chemotherapy for primary PDAC were selected. Immunohistochemistry using anti-CD74 antibody on paraffin-embedded tissue samples was performed, and cases were divided into two groups according to the ratio of CD74-positive cells: expression level I, CD74-positive cells <70%; level II, CD74-positive cells >or=70%. The correlation of CD74 expression level with clinicopathological features and overall survival was evaluated. Forty-seven (69.1%) and 21 (30.9%) patients showed level I and II CD74 expression, respectively. Patients with level II CD74 expression showed a higher rate of lymphatic permeation (P = 0.04) and perineural invasion (P = 0.01) compared with those with level I expression. Patients with level I CD74 expression had a significantly better survival rate than those with level II (P = 0.003).

"Renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a primary cause of acute renal failure that results in high mortality. This study aimed to investigate the effect of osthole, a natural coumarin derivative, on renal I/R injury in a rat model. Rats were randomly allocated to the sham operation + vehicle, I/R + vehicle, and I/R + osthole groups. Renal I/R injury was induced by clamping the left renal artery for 45 min followed by 12 h of reperfusion and a contralateral nephrectomy. Osthole (40 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected 30 min before inducing I/R. Renal function and histological damage were determined subsequently. Myeloperoxidase activity, monocyte/macrophage infiltration, as well as tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, and activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase expression in kidneys were also assessed.

"Through a genome-wide association study of a Japanese population, we recently identified TNFSF15, a gene encoding TNF-like ligand 1A (TL1A), as a susceptibility gene for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). We investigated the clinical significance of TL1A and one of its receptors, decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), in PBC. We analysed the systemic and local expression of TL1A and DcR3 in 110 PBC patients and 46 healthy controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. Serum TL1A levels were significantly increased in PBC patients at both early and late stages as compared with healthy controls, and its levels were significantly decreased in early-stage PBC patients after ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment. TL1A was immunohistochemically localized to biliary epithelial cells, Kupffer cells, blood vessels and infiltrating mononuclear cells in the PBC liver.

"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is characterized by non-invasive cancerous cell growth within the breast ducts. Although radiotherapy is commonly used in the treatment of DCIS, the effect and molecular mechanism of ionizing radiation (IR) on DCIS are not well understood, and invasive recurrence following radiotherapy remains a significant clinical problem. This study investigated the effects of IR on a clinically relevant model of Akt-driven DCIS and identified possible molecular mechanisms underlying invasive progression in surviving cells. We measured the level of phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt) in a cohort of human DCIS specimens by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlated it with recurrence risk. To model human DCIS, we used Akt overexpressing human mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A-Akt) which, in three-dimensional laminin-rich extracellular matrix (lrECM) and in vivo, form organotypic DCIS-like lesions with lumina expanded by pleiomorphic cells contained within an intact basement membrane. In a population of cells that survived significant IR doses in three-dimensional lrECM, a malignant phenotype emerged creating a model for invasive recurrence. P-Akt was up-regulated in clinical DCIS specimens and was associated with recurrent disease. MCF10A-Akt cells that formed DCIS-like structures in three-dimensional lrECM showed significant apoptosis after IR, preferentially in the luminal compartment. Strikingly, when cells that survived IR were repropagated in three-dimensional lrECM, a malignant phenotype emerged, characterized by invasive activity, up-regulation of fibronectin, α5β1-integrin, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and loss of E-cadherin. In addition, IR induced nuclear translocation and binding of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) to the β1-integrin promoter region, associated with up-regulation of α5β1-integrins.

"Recent studies demonstrated that the interactions of immature dendritic cells (iDCs) with myeloma cells enhance the clonogenic capacity of tumor cells while iDCs undergo osteoclast (OC) transformation. Here, we investigated these interactions as well as iDC behavior in terms of both migration and OC differentiation. We studied 12 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and 5 with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Chemokine receptors, tumor-mediated chemotaxis, and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) expression were investigated in iDCs, whereas receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) and transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) levels were measured in primary plasma cells. Furthermore, cocultures of myeloma cells with autologous iDCs were installed to verify OC differentiation of these cells. Finally, the role of RANK/RANKL in such OC differentiation was investigated by inhibiting this molecular pathway. Peripheral and marrow iDCs from MM showed high CXCR4 expression and were augmented in bone marrow of MM patients with respect to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Also, iDCs expressed APRIL, whereas RANKL and TACI were upregulated by malignant cells. The cellular contact of myeloma cells with iDCs enhanced the clonogenic effect on tumor growth, whereas iDCs were directly primed to undergo OC transformation. These iDCs, indeed, exerted typical bone resorption that was abrogated by disabling the RANK/RANKL pathway signals. By contrast, plasma cells from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance patients were ineffective in transforming autologous iDCs.",Are immature dendritic cells from patients with multiple myeloma prone to osteoclast differentiation in vitro?,"Our results emphasize the marrow cross-talk of iDCs with myeloma cells as an additional mechanism that upregulates osteoclastogenesis in MM, and suggest that such a RANKL-mediated OC differentiation of iDCs observed in vitro may also occur in vivo.",0,1.

"Sema4D/CD100 is a type of class 4 semaphorin, exhibiting crucial roles in growth cone guidance in developing neurons. Sema4D is widely expressed throughout the central nervous system in embryonic mouse brain, and is selectively localized to oligodendrocytes and myelin in the postnatal brain. However, direct evidence of the actual involvement of Sema4D in the neuronal network development crucial for neurobehavioral performance is still lacking. The present study therefore examined whether Sema4D deficiency leads to abnormal behavioral development. Both wild-type and Sema4D-deficient mice were subjected to behavioral analyses including open-field, adhesive tape removal, rotarod tests and a water maze task. Open-field tests revealed increased locomotor activity in Sema4D-deficient mice with less percentage of time spent in the center of the field. In both the adhesive tape removal and rotarod tests, which examine motor coordination and balance, Sema4D-deficient mice showed significantly superior performance, suggesting facilitated motor behavior. Both Sema4D-deficient and wild-type mice successfully learnt the water maze task, locating a hidden escape platform, and also showed precise memory for the platform position in probe tests.

"Inhibition of complement in small animal models of xenotransplantation has demonstrated graft infiltration with natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes associated with endothelial cell (EC) activation. We have previously demonstrated that human NK cells activate porcine EC in vitro, which results in adhesion molecule expression and cytokine secretion. In this study, we used the NK cell line NK92 to define the molecular and cellular basis of NK cell-mediated EC activation. EC were transfected with either reporter constructs containing the luciferase gene driven either by E-selectin or interleukin (IL)-8 promoters or a synthetic NF-kappaB-dependent promoter. In addition, a dominant-negative mutant tumor necrosis factor receptor I (TNFRI) expression vector was co-transfected in inhibition studies. Forty-eight hours after transfection, EC were stimulated with NK cells or NK cell membrane extracts for 7 hr and activation was measured by a luciferase assay. Co-culture of NK cells with transfected EC enhanced E-selectin, IL-8, and NF-kappaB-dependent promoter activity. NK cell membrane extracts retained the capacity to activate EC and induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB (p50 and p65). Western blotting of NK cell and membrane extracts detected the presence of Lymphotoxin-alpha (LTalpha) but not tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Furthermore, LTalpha was secreted in NK:EC co-cultures.

C57Bl/6J mice were fed a low- or high-fat diet and the expression of FVII messenger RNA (mRNA) was then examined in adipose tissue. 3T3-L1 cells were used as an adipocyte model for in vitro experiments in which these cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or isoproterenol. The expression and secretion of FVII were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The expression of FVII mRNA in the adipose tissue of mice fed with high-fat diet was significantly higher than that in mice fed with low-fat diet. Expression of the FVII gene and protein was induced during adipogenesis and maintained in mature adipocytes. The expression and secretion of FVII mRNA were increased in the culture medium of 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with TNF-α, and these effects were blocked when these cells were exposed to inhibitors of mitogen-activated kinases or NF-κB activation. The β-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol stimulated the secretion of FVII from mature adipocytes via the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway. Blockade of secreted FVII with the anti-FVII antibody did not affect the phosphorylation of Akt in the isoproterenol-stimulated adipocytes.",Is the production of coagulation factor VII by adipocytes enhanced by tumor necrosis factor-α or isoproterenol?,Obese adipose tissue produced FVII.

"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing, which are involved in multiple developmental processes in many organisms. Apart from miRNAs, mouse germ cells express another type of small RNA, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Although it has been clear that piRNAs play a role in repression of retrotransposons during spermatogenesis, the function of miRNA in mouse germ cells has been unclear. In this study, we first revealed the expression pattern of miRNAs by using a real-time PCR-based 220-plex miRNA expression profiling method. During development of germ cells, miR-17-92 cluster, which is thought to promote cell cycling, and the ES cell-specific cluster encoding miR-290 to -295 (miR-290-295 cluster) were highly expressed in primordial germ cells (PGCs) and spermatogonia. A set of miRNAs was developmentally regulated. We next analysed function of miRNA biogenesis in germ cell development by using conditional Dicer-knockout mice in which Dicer gene was deleted specifically in the germ cells. Dicer-deleted PGCs and spermatogonia exhibited poor proliferation. Retrotransposon activity was unexpectedly suppressed in Dicer-deleted PGCs, but not affected in the spermatogonia. In Dicer-deleted testis, spermatogenesis was retarded at an early stage when proliferation and/or early differentiation. Additionally, we analysed spermatogenesis in conditional Argonaute2-deficient mice. In contrast to Dicer-deficient testis, spermatogenesis in Argonaute2-deficient testis was indistinguishable from that in wild type.",Is microRNA biogenesis required for mouse primordial germ cell development and spermatogenesis?,"These results illustrate that miRNAs are important for the proliferation of PGCs and spermatogonia, but dispensable for the repression of retrotransposons in developing germ cells.

"Bostrycin is a novel compound isolated from marine fungi that inhibits proliferation of many cancer cells. However, the inhibitory effect of bostrycin on lung cancers has not been reported. This study is to investigate the inhibitory effects and mechanism of bostrycin on human lung cancer cells in vitro. We used MTT assay, flow cytometry, microarray, real time PCR, and Western blotting to detect the effect of bostrycin on A549 human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells. We showed a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in bostrycin-treated lung adenocarcinoma cells. Bostrycin treatment caused cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. We also found the upregulation of microRNA-638 and microRNA-923 in bostrycin-treated cells. further, we found the downregulation of p110α and p-Akt/PKB proteins and increased activity of p27 protein after bostrycin treatment in A549 cells.",Does bostrycin inhibit proliferation of human lung carcinoma A549 cells via downregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway?,Our study indicated that bostrycin had a significant inhibitory effect on proliferation of A549 cells.

"Macrophage activation contributes importantly to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis. Macrophages exist chronically under moderate hypoxia (2% to 5% O(2)) in inflamed tissues such as atherosclerotic plaques. However, macrophage phenotypes in such environments remain incompletely understood. This study tested the hypothesis that chronic moderate hypoxia induces macrophage activation and explored the underlying mechanisms. We cultured primary human macrophages derived from peripheral blood monocytes in moderate hypoxia (2% O(2) tension) or normoxia (21% O(2)) for 10 days. Moderate hypoxia did not affect macrophage differentiation assessed via expression levels of scavenger receptor A. Chronic moderate hypoxia, but not normoxia, activated Akt and inactivated GSK-3beta, a negative effector of Akt, thus allowing nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. 2% O(2) tension increased accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factors 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) transiently at 3 to 5 days. Hypoxia induced mRNA expression of the beta-catenin-associated genes: MMP-7, CD44, and c-Myc. RNAi of TCF7L2, a cofactor of beta-catenin, suppressed MMP-7 expression induced by hypoxia. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation with LY294002 abolished hypoxia-induced GSK-3beta inactivation, beta-catenin activation, and MMP-7 expression. Macrophages under hypoxia were more resistant for oxLDL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, phospho-Akt colocalized with MMP-7 and CD44 expression in macrophages of human atherosclerotic plaques.",Does chronic hypoxia activate the Akt and beta-catenin pathways in human macrophages?,"Chronic moderate hypoxia induces macrophage activation via the Akt and beta-catenin pathways, providing new insight into the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.",0,1.

"The ras family of proto-oncogenes encodes for small GTPases that play critical roles in cell-cycle progression and cellular transformation. ERK1/2 MAP kinases are major ras effectors. Tumors in chemically treated mouse skin contain mutations in the Ha-ras proto- oncogene. Amplification and mutation of Ha-ras has been shown to correlate with malignant progression of these tumors. Cell lines isolated from mouse skin tumors represent the stages of tumor development, such as the PDV:PDVC57 cell line pair and B9 squamous carcinoma and A5 spindle cells. PDVC57 cells were selected from PDV cells, which were transformed with dimethyl-benzanthracene (DMBA) in vitro and then transplanted in adult syngeneic mice. The PDV:PDVC57 pair contains ratio of normal:mutant Ha-ras 2:1 and 1:2, respectively. This genetic alteration correlates with more advanced tumorigenic characteristics of PDVC57 compared to PDV. The squamous carcinoma B9 cell clone was isolated from the same primary tumor as A5 spindle cell line. The mutant Ha-ras allele, also present in B9, is amplified and overexpressed in A5 cells. Therefore these cell line pairs represent an in vivo model for studies of Ha-ras and ERK1/2 signaling in mouse tumorigenesis. The ERK1/2 status in the above mouse cell lines was examined by using various molecular techniques. For the study of the tumorigenic properties and the role of the ras/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway in the cell lines mentioned, phenotypic characteristics, colony formation assay, anchorage-independent growth, and gelatin zymography were assessed, after or without treatment with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was found to be increased in PDVC57 when compared to PDV. This also applies to A5 spindle carcinoma cells when compared to squamous carcinoma and papilloma cells. The above finding was reproduced when transfecting human activated Ha-ras allele into PDV, thus demonstrating that Ha-ras enhances ERK1/2 signaling. To further test whether ERK1/2 activation was required for growth we used the MEK-1 inhibitor, PD98059. The latter inhibited cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of squamous and spindle cells. In addition, PD98059 treatment partially reverted the spindle morphology of A5 cells.",Does the progression in the mouse skin carcinogenesis model correlate with ERK1/2 signaling?,"These data suggest, for the first time, that oncogenicity and the degree of progression in the mouse skin carcinogenesis model correlates with ERK1/2 signaling.",0,1.

"Neurite outgrowth inhibitor proteins (Nogos) comprise a family of three major members and are characterized by a conserved RHD domain. Among all the members, Nogo-B was identified to be significantly elevated and to play an important role in liver cirrhosis while Nogo-C was the shortest one and received little attention. The aim of this study is to investigate the relevance and mechanism of Nogo-C involved in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of Nogo-C in paired HCC specimens was measured with quantitative RT-PCR. The function of Nogo-C over expressing in SMMC-7721 and WRL-68 HCC cell lines were estimated through cell proliferation assay and colony formation assay. A proteome-wide identification of Nogo-C-binding proteins was performed using affinity purification combined with a highly sensitive mass spectrometric technique. The protein interactions were confirmed using co-IP and immunofluorescence confocal assays. Compared with the neighboring pathologically normal tissues, the expression of Nogo-C mRNA was extremely down-regulated in HCC specimens and was significantly related to greater tumor size and worse prognosis. Overexpression of Nogo-C in HCC cell lines resulted in an inhibition of cell growth. A total of 73 proteins were detected and considered in association with Nogo-C, among which B-raf and Nogo-B were validated.",Does nogo-C contribute to HCC tumorigenesis via suppressing cell growth and its interactome analysis with comparative proteomics research?,We identify Nogo-C as a tumor suppressor gene in HCC and B-raf as a novel interacting protein.

"Previous studies demonstrate that threonine and tyrosine kinase (TTK) is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but there are conflicting results regarding its effect on TNBC survival. The purpose of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of TTK expression in primary TNBC. Of 169 consecutive cases eligible for this study, 164 included follow-up information. Cytoplasm and membrane TTK staining was observed in 99.4% of cases, while 5.9% displayed whole cell immunostaining. At a discriminating threshold of 55, elevated TTK expression was associated with prolonged disease free survival (DFS) (p < 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.024) in primary TNBC and prolonged DFS in individual basal-like (p = 0.001) and non-basal-like (p = 0.001) TNBC subtypes. In addition, Cox regression analysis demonstrated that elevated TTK expression was an independent prognostic factor for DFS in TNBC (p < 0.001). TTK expression of 169 samples was tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to identify a cutpoint for TTK expression, which was analyzed for its association with patients' clinicopathological factors and survival using Chi-square, log-rank, and Cox regression analyses.",Is tTK a favorable prognostic biomarker for triple-negative breast cancer survival?,TTK is a favorable prognostic biomarker associated with TNBC survival.,0,1.

"Acetaminophen (APAP) is a safe analgesic and antipyretic drug. However, APAP overdose leads to massive hepatocyte death. Cell death during APAP toxicity occurs by oncotic necrosis, in which the release of intracellular contents can elicit a reactive inflammatory response. We have previously demonstrated that an intravascular gradient of chemokines and mitochondria-derived formyl peptides collaborate to guide neutrophils to sites of liver necrosis by CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) and formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), respectively. Here, we investigated the role of CXCR2 chemokines and mitochondrial products during APAP-induced liver injury and in liver neutrophil influx and hepatotoxicity. During APAP overdose, neutrophils accumulated into the liver, and blockage of neutrophil infiltration by anti-granulocyte receptor 1 depletion or combined CXCR2-FPR1 antagonism significantly prevented hepatotoxicity. In agreement with our in vivo data, isolated human neutrophils were cytotoxic to HepG2 cells when cocultured, and the mechanism of neutrophil killing was dependent on direct contact with HepG2 cells and the CXCR2-FPR1-signaling pathway. Also, in mice and humans, serum levels of both mitochondrial DNA (mitDNA) and CXCR2 chemokines were higher during acute liver injury, suggesting that necrosis products may reach remote organs through the circulation, leading to a systemic inflammatory response. Accordingly, APAP-treated mice exhibited marked systemic inflammation and lung injury, which was prevented by CXCR2-FPR1 blockage and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) absence (TLR9(-/-) mice).",Do chemokines and mitochondrial products activate neutrophils to amplify organ injury during mouse acute liver failure?,"Chemokines and mitochondrial products (e.g., formyl peptides and mitDNA) collaborate in neutrophil-mediated injury and systemic inflammation during acute liver failure.

"Progesterone (PROG) has been shown to reduce the risk of developing ovarian carcinoma in postmenopausal women who have undergone estrogen and progestogen replacement therapy, and it has been clinically used to treat some types of ovarian tumors. It is not yet clear whether or not the antitumor activity of progestogen is due to its ability to induce apoptosis in precarcinomatous and carcinomatous ovarian cells. The apoptosis-related genes p53, bcl-2, and c-myc have important roles in the regulation of programmed cell death, and thus may be involved in the process of the suspected PROG-induced apoptosis. Antiproliferation effects of PROG on 3AO and AO ovarian carcinoma cells were determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Apoptosis of the PROG-treated cells was determined by DNA laddering analysis and was quantitated by both nuclear condensation and flow cytometry after cells were stained with propidium iodide. Cell cycle analysis was also performed by flow cytometry. The expression of p53, bcl-2, and c-myc after 72 hours of PROG treatment was detected by Northern blot analysis. In both 3AO and AO cell lines, cells proliferation was maximally inhibited by PROG after 72 hours of treatment at 10 microM concentration. Under the same conditions, more than 50% of PROG-treated cells had undergone apoptosis, whereas less than 3% of the cells were apoptotic in untreated cell cultures.

"Clinical studies have implicated preinfarct angina (brief antecedent ischemia/reperfusion [I/R]) as a predictor of more rapid thrombolysis and lower rates of reocclusion. However, the effects of antecedent ischemia on the efficacy of thrombolysis have not been rigorously assessed. Using a canine model of coronary thrombosis, we aimed to (1) reproduce these clinical findings and (2) determine whether release of adenosine (a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation via stimulation of platelet A(2) receptors) during brief I/R contributes to this improved patency. To address our first objective, we compared the time required to achieve lysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and patency during the first 2 hours after lysis in dogs in which 1-hour thrombotic occlusion was preceded by brief I/R (10-minute coronary occlusion/10-minute reperfusion) versus 20-minute uninterrupted perfusion (controls). Time to lysis was accelerated in the I/R group versus the control group (11+/-1 versus 35+/-6 minutes, P=0.004). In addition, the duration of subsequent reocclusion was reduced (17+/-12 versus 30+/-11 minutes), and the area of the flow-time profile (normalized to baseline flow x 120 minutes) was increased (64+/-12% versus 35+/-7%, P=0.04) in the I/R cohort. The protocol was then repeated, but all dogs were pretreated with the adenosine A(2)/A(1) antagonist CGS 15943 (CGS, 1.5 mg/kg).

A total of 278 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas were included. Each case was evaluated for genetic mutations and histologic classification. Lineage genes associated with respiratory tract differentiation (NK2 homeobox 1 gene [NKX2-1], GATA protein binding 6 gene [GATA6], foxhead box J1 gene [FOXJ1], and SAM pointed domain containing ETS transcription factor gene [SPDEF]) and stem/basal-like status (inhibitor of DNA binding 2, HLH protein gene [ID2], POU class 5 homeobox 1 gene [POU5F1], SRY-box 2 gene [SOX2], and v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog gene [MYC]) were selected. mRNA expression of these genes in each tumor sample was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and normalized to paired normal lung tissue. Distinct lineage gene expressions were found on the basis of genetic and histologic diversities. Expression of NKX2-1, GATA6, FOXJ1, and POU5F1 exhibited a significant linear relationship across histologic subgroups that was independent of genetic mutation status. Expression levels of NKX2-1 and POU5F1 were also associated with EGFR mutation status, independent of histologic subtypes. Further analysis revealed that the overexpression of SPDEF defined longer relapse-free survivals, especially in stage I disease.",Do the Histologic Classifications of Lung Adenocarcinomas Are Discriminable by Unique Lineage Backgrounds?,"For the first time, we showed the unique lineage backgrounds of different histologic subtypes and oncogenic mutations.

"Transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM) has been correlated with the presence of white cells (WBCs) in blood transfusions, but the role of components such as platelets (PLTs) in mediating TRIM has not been extensively examined. We designed a murine PLT transfusion model to study whether leukoreduced PLTs mediate TRIM effects. CBA recipient mice were administered four weekly transfusions of either fresh (4 hr) or aged (24 and 72 hr) donor leukoreduced PLTs from allogeneic BALB/c mice and then transplanted with skin grafts from donor-matched mice. TRIM was measured by comparing the times to graft rejection and these were correlated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody development measured by flow cytometry. Compared with nontransfused control recipients, four transfusions of fresh, extremely leukoreduced (<0.05 WBCs/mL), allogeneic PLTs significantly (p < 0.002) reduced the recipient's ability to reject donor-matched skin grafts (survival >49 days compared with <14 days in nontransfused controls) despite the presence of high-titered serum IgG donor antibodies. In contrast, however, aged PLTs or fresh PLTs devoid of MHC Class I molecules were unable to affect skin graft survival nor stimulate antibody production. The PLT age-related inability to induce TRIM was shown to be due to loss of PLT-associated MHC Class I molecules; soluble supernatant MHC molecules that were transfused were unable to induce TRIM.",Is transfusion-related immunomodulation by platelets dependent on their expression of MHC Class I molecules and is independent of white cells?,"These results suggest that fresh PLTs can induce TRIM independently of WBCs due to their MHC antigen expression whereas aging results in loss of MHC and ability to mediate TRIM.

"Interstitial cells, also called myofibroblasts, most probably play a major role in the pathogenesis of the overactive bladder. However, no specific phenotypic marker has been identified. We investigated whether N-cadherin could play a role as a discriminatory marker for interstitial cells in the human bladder. Bladder biopsies (n = 16) were collected from macroscopically nonpathological locations during cystectomy which was performed because of bladder cancer. Tissue was analyzed for expression of N-cadherin. N-cadherin+ cells were phenotyped using antibodies against PGP9.5, smoothelin, vimentin, and C-kit. Findings were related to bladder tissue histology and ultrastructure of myofibroblastic cells. N-cadherin+/vimentin+ cells with branched cell bodies were found in the lamina propria and detrusor layer. They were closely associated with neurons and showed no colocalization of PGP9.5 or smoothelin.

"Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a life saving intervention for patients with respiratory failure. Even after 6 hours of MV, diaphragm atrophy and dysfunction (collectively referred to as ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction, VIDD) occurs in concert with a blunted blood flow and oxygen delivery. The regulation of hypoxia sensitive factors (i.e. hypoxia inducible factor 1α, 2α (HIF-1α,-2α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) and angio-neogenetic factors (angiopoietin 1-3, Ang) might contribute to reactive and compensatory alterations in diaphragm muscle. Male Wistar rats (n = 8) were ventilated for 24 hours or directly sacrificed (n = 8), diaphragm and mixed gastrocnemius muscle tissue was removed. Quantitative real time PCR and western blot analyses were performed to detect changes in angio-neogenetic factors and inflammatory markers. Tissues were stained using Isolectin (IB 4) to determine capillarity and calculate the capillary/fiber ratio. MV resulted in up-regulation of Ang 2 and HIF-1α mRNA in both diaphragm and gastrocnemius, while VEGF mRNA was down-regulated in both tissues. HIF-2α mRNA was reduced in both tissues, while GLUT 4 mRNA was increased in gastrocnemius and reduced in diaphragm samples. Protein levels of VEGF, HIF-1α, -2α and 4 did not change significantly. Additionally, inflammatory cytokine mRNA (Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and TNF α) were elevated in diaphragm tissue.",Does prolonged mechanical ventilation alter the expression pattern of angio-neogenetic factors in a pre-clinical rat model?,The results demonstrate that 24 hrs of MV and the associated limb disuse induce an up-regulation of angio-neogenetic factors that are connected to HIF-1α.

"Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis most commonly afflicting children <5 years of age. Many autoimmune diseases are associated with up-regulation of T helper (Th) 17 cells, and down-regulation Treg cells. Few studies have examined the Th17/Treg expression in Kawasaki disease. Blood samples were obtained from 186 children with Kawasaki disease at 24 h before IVIG therapy, followed by 3 days and 21 days after IVIG therapy. Thirty children with an acute febrile infectious disease and 30 healthy children were obtained as control. Plasma levels of Th17- and Treg-related cytokines including IL-6, IL-17A, IL-10, TGF-β, and mRNA expression levels of RORγt and Foxp3 were tested. Patients with Kawasaki disease had higher levels of plasma IL-17A (25.35 ± 3.21 vs 7.78 ± 1.78 pg/ml, P < 0.001) and IL-6 (152.29 ± 21.94 vs 38.63 ± 12.40 pg/ml, P < 0.001) when compared to the febrile control group. IVIG resulted in a reduction in IL-6 and IL-17A at both 3 and 21 days after IVIG therapy. FoxP3 levels increased significantly 3 days after IVIG therapy (2.28 ± 0.34 vs 0.88 ± 0.14, P < 0.001).

"Monocytes, which are key players in innate immunity, are outnumbered by neutrophils and lymphocytes among peripheral white blood cells. The cytokine interferon-β (IFN-β) is widely used as an immunomodulatory drug for multiple sclerosis and its functional pathways in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) have been previously described. The aim of the present study was to identify novel, cell-specific IFN-β functions and pathways in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-activated monocytes that may have been missed in studies using PBMCs. Whole genome gene expression profiles of human monocytes and T cells were compared following in vitro priming to TNF-α and overnight exposure to IFN-β. Statistical analyses of the gene expression data revealed a cell-type-specific change of 699 transcripts, 667 monocyte-specific transcripts, 21 T cell-specific transcripts and 11 transcripts with either a difference in the response direction or a difference in the magnitude of response. RT-PCR revealed a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), exhibiting responses to IFN-β that are modulated by TNF-α in monocytes, such as RIPK2 and CD83, but not in T cells or PBMCs. Known IFN-β promoter response elements, such as ISRE, were enriched in T cell DEGs but not in monocyte DEGs.

"RANTES plays an important role in the production of allergic inflammation of the airway through its chemotactic activity for eosinophils. The cellular reduction and oxidation (redox) changes are involved in the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and the induction of cytokine expression. It has previously been shown that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-MA activates p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase to produce cytokine, including RANTES, that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) attenuates cytokine production by human bronchial epithelial cells (BECs), and that sensitivity to TNFalpha is inversely correlated with cellular redox state. However, a role of cellular redox regulated by intracellular glutathione (GSH) in TNFalpha-induced p38 MAP kinase activation and p38 MAP kinase-mediated RANTES production by human BECs has not been determined. Human BECs were exposed to NAC or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). TNFalpha-induced p38 MAP kinase activation and p38 MAP kinase-mediated RANTES production by human BECs were then examined in order to clarify these issues. The results showed that: NAC attenuated TNFalpha-induced p38 MAP kinase activation and RANTES production; SB 203580 as the specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase activity attenuated TNF-alpha-induced RANTES production; BSO facilitated TNF-alpha-induced p38 MAP kinase activation and RANTES production; SB 203580 attenuated BSO-mediated facilitation of TNF-alpha-induced RANTES production; and the intracellular GSH increased in NAC-treated cells, whereas the intracellular GSH was reduced in BSO-treated cells.",Does intracellular glutathione regulate tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced p38 MAP kinase activation and RANTES production by human bronchial epithelial cells?,These results indicate that cellular redox regulated by GSH is critical for TNF-alpha-induced p38 MAP kinase activation and p38 MAP kinase-mediated RANTES production by human BECs.,0,1.

"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease with variable prognosis in which lesions and clinical features suggest that pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be involved in its pathogenesis. The authors wished to evaluate whether serum levels of interleukin-1 receptor agonist (IL-1Ra) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are elevated in children with LCH and decrease after chemotherapy. Circulating levels of IL-1Ra and TNF-alpha were measured in 23 and 8 children with LCH, respectively, and 7 pediatric controls using commercially available ELISA kits. All patients fulfilled the Histiocyte Society LCH Protocols criteria for diagnosis, stratification, and treatment. Pretreatment concentrations of IL-1Ra and TNF-alpha were found to be significantly elevated in patients with LCH compared with controls. Among LCH substages, a significant difference in IL-1Ra values was observed between individuals with single-system single-site disease vs. multisystem disease with risk-organ dysfunction.

"Despite over forty years of investigation on low-level light therapy (LLLT), the fundamental mechanisms underlying photobiomodulation at a cellular level remain unclear. In this study, we isolated murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from transgenic NF-kB luciferase reporter mice and studied their response to 810 nm laser radiation. Significant activation of NF-kB was observed at fluences higher than 0.003 J/cm(2) and was confirmed by Western blot analysis. NF-kB was activated earlier (1 hour) by LLLT compared to conventional lipopolysaccharide treatment. We also observed that LLLT induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production similar to mitochondrial inhibitors, such as antimycin A, rotenone and paraquat. Furthermore, we observed similar NF-kB activation with these mitochondrial inhibitors. These results, together with inhibition of laser induced NF-kB activation by antioxidants, suggests that ROS play an important role in the laser induced NF-kB signaling pathways.

"To explore the associations between genetic variations of DNA repair gene RAD52 and response to platinum-based chemotherapy of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and to analyze the influencing factors on survival. Nine haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) of RAD52 were genotyped by Sequenom Mass ARRAY technology in 939 SCLC patients who received platinum-based chemotherapy, and had different response and survival time. The associations between genotypes and platinum-based chemotherapy response were analyzed by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for sex, age, smoking, KPS, staging and chemotherapy regimens, by unconditional logistic regression model. The relative ratios (RRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression model. Among the 939 cases, 483 (51.4%) cases received cis-platinum and etoposide treatment while others treated with carboplatin and etoposide. Six hundred and eighty two patients were chemotherapy responders in the study with a response rate of 72.6%. Patients were followed up to get their survival information. The median survival time (MST) of these patients was 25 months. We found that rs10774474 SNP which located in the 5'-flanking region of RAD52 was significantly associated with chemotherapy response. Compared with the TT genotype, patients with TA and AA genotype had a worse chemotherapy response and increased risk of no-response (P=0.004). Correlation analysis showed that patients with KPS >80 had a better chemotherapy response than those with KPS≤80 (P=0.001). The patients with extensive-stage had a worse chemotherapy response than those with limited-stage (P<0.001). Cox proportional hazards regression model analysis showed that nine htSNPs of RAD52 were not associated with the overall survival (OS) of SCLC patients who received platinum-based chemotherapy.

"Treatment for primary prostate cancer (CaP) is the withdrawal of androgens. However, CaP eventually progresses to grow in a castration-resistant state. The mechanisms involved in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remain unknown. We have previously generated LNCaP-IL6+ cells by treating LNCaP cells chronically with interleukin-6 (IL-6), which have acquired the ability to grow in androgen-deprived conditions. We compared the protein expression profile of LNCaP and LNCaP-IL6+ cells using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The gels were then silver stained in order to visualize proteins and the differentially expressed spots were identified and characterized by micro sequencing using MALDI-PMF mass spectrometry. In this study, we have identified RhoGDIα (GDIα) as a suppressor of CaP growth. Expression of GDIα was reduced in LNCaP-IL6+ cells and was down-regulated in more aggressive CaP cells compared to LNCaP cells. Over expression of GDIα inhibited the growth of CaP cells and caused LNCaP-IL6+ cells reversal to androgen-sensitive state, while down-regulation of GDIα enhanced growth of androgen-sensitive LNCaP CaP cells in androgen-deprived conditions.

"Effective treatment for bacteria-induced bone lytic diseases is not yet available. In this study, we showed that PAR, an NF-kappaB inhibitor found in medicinal herbs, can block LPS-induced osteolysis. PAR does this by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption and promoting apoptosis of osteoclasts through the suppression of NF-kappaB activity. Osteolysis induced by chronic gram-negative bacterial infection underlies many bone diseases such as osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and periodontitis. Drugs that inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced osteolysis are critically needed for the prevention of bone destruction in infective bone diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of parthenolide (PAR) on LPS-induced osteolysis in vivo and studied its role in osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption, apoptosis, and NF-kappaB activity. The LPS-induced osteolysis in the mouse calvarium model was used to examine the effect of PAR in vivo. RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation from RAW264.7 cells and bone resorption assays were used to assess the effect of PAR in vitro. Assays for NF-kappaB activation, p65 translocation, and IkappaB-alpha degradation were used to determine the mechanism of action of PAR in osteoclasts and their precursors. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopic analysis were used to examine cell apoptosis. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed to examine the effect of PAR on gene expression of RANK and TRAF6. We found that PAR (0.5 and 1 mg/kg), injected simultaneously with LPS (25 mg/kg) or 3 days later, blocked the LPS-induced osteolysis in the mouse calvarium model. In vitro studies showed that low concentrations of PAR (<1 microM) inhibited in vitro osteoclastogenesis and osteoclastic bone resorption, whereas higher concentrations (>5 microM) triggered apoptotic cell death of osteoclasts and their precursor cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, PAR inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation, p65 translocation, and IkappaB-alpha degradation both in mature osteoclasts and their precursors in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

"Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ, encoded by ESR2 gene) and cytochrome P450 aromatase (encoded by CYP19A1 gene) play critical roles in endometriosis, and the levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in the peritoneal fluid are significantly higher in patients with endometriosis compared with those in normal women. However, the effects and mechanisms of IGF-I on ERβ and aromatase expression remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, human endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs) and endometrial cells (EMs) derived from ovarian endometriomas and eutopic endometrial tissues. ESCs were cultured with IGF-I, signal pathway inhibitors, and siRNAs. ERβ and aromatase expression were measured by real-time PCR and Western, respectively. The binding of c-Jun and CREB to the ESR2 and CYP19A1 promoters was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Animal experiments were performed in a xenograft mouse model. Levels of IGF-I mRNA in ESCs were markedly higher than those in EMs. IGF-I upregulated ERβ and aromatase expression in ESCs after stimulation of the IGF1R/PI3K/AKT pathway. Following IGF-I treatment, a marked increase in c-Jun and CREB phosphorylation occurred, enhancing binding to the ESR2 and CYP19A1 promoters. An IGF1R inhibitor in vivo reduced IGF-I-induced endometriosis graft growth and ERβ and aromatase expression.

"The prevalence of periodontitis is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and the severity of periodontitis can affect the level of arthritis. Porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the main bacteria involved in periodontitis. Our aim was to determine if there are differences in the innate immune response against P gingivalis between healthy controls and RA patients. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) from healthy controls, RA patients, and patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) were stimulated with P gingivalis, a range of other bacteria, and Toll-like receptor agonists. Cytokine production was determined, and blocking studies were performed to determine which receptors were involved in differential recognition of P gingivalis. Effects on T cell cytokines were also determined in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Upon stimulation with P gingivalis, RA patient DCs produced less tumor necrosis factor as compared to healthy control DCs, which was not observed in PsA patients or upon stimulation with other bacteria. In addition, P gingivalis-mediated activation of RA patient PBMCs showed a clear reduction of interferon-γ production. Among the various possible underlying mechanisms investigated, only blockade of CR3 abolished the difference between RA patients and healthy controls, suggesting the involvement of CR3 in this process.",Does impaired Porphyromonas gingivalis-Induced Tumor Necrosis Factor Production by Dendritic Cells typify Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis?,"Immune cells from RA patients display a reduced response to P gingivalis, which has functional consequences for the immune response.

"Depletion of medial smooth muscle cell (SMC) is a major pathological characteristic of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), although the mechanism by which these cells are eliminated remains incompletely understood. We reasoned that necroptosis, a recently described form of necrosis mediated by receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3), may contribute to AAA pathology through the induction of SMC death and the significant production of inflammatory cytokines. To test the hypothesis that RIP3-mediated necroptosis is actively involved in aneurysm pathogenesis. RIP3 and RIP1 levels were found to be elevated in human AAAs, most noticeably in SMCs. Elevations of RIP3 and SMC necrosis were also observed in the elastase-induced mouse model of AAAs. Deletion of one or both copies of Rip3 prevented AAA formation. By transplanting Rip3(+/-) aortae to Rip3(+/+) mice, we demonstrated that reduced Rip3 expression in arterial wall was the primary cause of aneurysm resistance. In vitro, adenoviral overexpression of RIP3 was sufficient to trigger SMC necroptosis. Protein kinase C-delta contributed to tumor necrosis factor-α-induced SMC necroptosis by regulating Rip3 expression. Furthermore, Rip3 deficiency impaired tumor necrosis factor-α-induced inflammatory gene expression in aortic SMCs, which was at least in part because of attenuation of p65 Ser536 phosphorylation. In vivo, the lack of RIP3 diminished activation of p65 in SMCs, implicating a necrosis independent function of RIP3 in aneurysms.",Does receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 contribute to abdominal aortic aneurysms via smooth muscle cell necrosis and inflammation?,"Enhanced RIP3 signaling in aneurysmal tissues contributes to AAA progression by causing SMC necroptosis, as well as stimulating vascular inflammation, and therefore may serve as a novel therapeutic target for AAA treatment.",0,1.

"The disturbance of mitochondrial functions has been considered as one of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis (AP) followed by kidney failure. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of methylene blue (MB) on pancreas and kidney mitochondrial respiratory functions during experimental acute pancreatitis in rats. AP was induced by administrating sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct of male Wistar rats. The rats were divided into three groups: the MB group, MB (5 mg/kg) was injected intravenously 10 min prior to AP induction; the AP group, saline solution was injected intravenously 10 min prior to AP induction; and the sham operation group, isotonic sodium chlorine was used instead of sodium taurocholate. The animals were sacrificed after 24 h. The pancreas and kidney were removed for mitochondrial assay by oxygraphic and spectrophotometric methods. Intravenous injection of MB did not prevent AP-induced inhibition of pancreatic mitochondrial respiration; however, MB significantly improved kidney mitochondrial respiratory functions with complex I-dependent substrates glutamate and malate. The activity of complex I of mitochondria isolated from AP-damaged kidney was increased after pretreatment with MB. However, MB did not affect AP-inhibited kidney mitochondrial respiration with succinate.

"Acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome are characterized by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, which can be assessed by measurement of extravascular lung water. Traditionally, extravascular lung water has been indexed to actual body weight (mL/kg). Because lung size is dependent on height rather than weight, we hypothesized indexing to predicted body weight may be a better predictor of mortality in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome. Prospective observational cohort study. A tertiary referral intensive care unit. Patients were recruited within 48 hrs of fulfilling the American European Consensus Conference definition of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome. None. Demographics, severity of illness scores, and respiratory parameters were collected. Extravascular lung water was measured using the PiCCO system. This was indexed to actual and predicted body weight. Statistically significant predictors of mortality identified using single regressor logistic regression and additional variables known to be associated with outcome were entered into a multiple logistic regression analysis. Receiver operator characteristic curves were generated. Forty-four patients were recruited (septic 34%). Using single regressor logistic regression, six variables were statistically significantly related to mortality: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, PaO2, PaO2/Fio2 ratio, oxygenation index, actual extravascular lung water, and predicted extravascular lung water. In multiple logistic regression analysis, predicted extravascular lung water but not actual extravascular lung water was a predictor of mortality with an odds ratio of 4.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.5-12.9) per sd. Although the area under the curve for predicted extravascular lung water (0.8; confidence interval, 0.65-0.94) was larger than for actual extravascular lung water (0.72; confidence interval, 0.53-0.91), this was not statistically significant (p = .12). A baseline predicted extravascular lung water value of 16 mL/kg predicted intensive care unit mortality with a sensitivity of 0.75 (confidence interval, 0.47-0.91) and specificity of 0.78 (confidence interval, 0.61-0.89).",Is extravascular lung water indexed to predicted body weight a novel predictor of intensive care unit mortality in patients with acute lung injury?,Early measurement of predicted extravascular lung water is a better predictor than actual extravascular lung water to identify patients at risk for death in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome.,0,Is extravascular lung water adjusted for anticipated body weight a new indicator of ICU mortality in acute lung injury patients?,23.0,2778.0,2940.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.4204285144805908,1.6292381286621094,3.905686378479004,"Yes, extravascular lung water indexed to predicted body weight is a novel predictor of intensive care unit mortality in patients with acute lung injury, as it was found to be a significant predictor in the study, with an odds ratio of 4.3.",0.7
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs result in the detection of early-stage asymptomatic carcinomas suitable to be surgically cured. Lymph nodes (LN) from early CRC are usually small and may be difficult to collect. Still, at least 12 LNs should be analyzed from colectomies, to ensure a reliable pN0 stage. Presurgical endoscopic tattooing improves LN procurement. In addition, molecular detection of occult LN tumor burden in histologically pN0 CRC patients is associated with a decreased survival rate. We aimed to study the impact of presurgical endoscopic tattooing on the molecular detection of LN tumor burden in early colon neoplasms. A prospective cohort study from a CRC screening-based population was performed at a tertiary academic hospital. LNs from colectomies with and without preoperative endoscopic tattooing were assessed by two methods, hematoxylin and eosin (HE), and RT-LAMP, to detect tumor cytokeratin 19 (CK19) mRNA. We compared the amount of tumor burden and LN yields from tattooed and non-tattooed specimens. HE and RT-LAMP analyses of 936 LNs were performed from 71 colectomies containing early carcinomas and endoscopically unresectable adenomas (8 pT0, 17 pTis, 27 pT1, 19 pT2); 47 out of 71 (66.2 %) were tattooed. Molecular positivity correlated with the presence of tattoo in LN [p < 0.001; OR 3.1 (95 % CI 1.7-5.5)].

"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is characterized by pruritus, elevated bile acids, and, specifically, elevated disulphated progesterone metabolites. We aimed to study changes in these parameters during treatment with dexamethasone or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in 40 out of 130 women included in the Swedish ICP intervention trial (26 randomized to placebo or UDCA, 14 randomized to dexamethasone). Serum bile acid profiles and urinary steroid hormone metabolites were analyzed using isotope-dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and electrospray-mass spectrometry. We found that all patients displayed ICP-typical serum bile acid profiles with >50% cholic acid at baseline but almost 80% UDCA upon treatment with this bile acid. In UDCA-treated patients, relative amounts of disulphated progesterone metabolites in urine decreased by 34%, 48% (P < 0.05), and 55% (P < 0.05) after 1, 2, and 3 weeks of treatment, respectively, which was significantly correlated to improvements of pruritus scores but not to serum bile acid levels.

"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the pathogenesis of myocardial hypertrophy. NADPH oxidase is a major source of ROS production. The small GTPase Rac1 mediates the activation of NADPH oxidase; however, the mechanism of Rac1 activation is incompletely understood. Transaortic constriction (TAC, C57/Bl6 mice, 360 microm, 21 days) increased the ratio of heart to body weight from [ per thousand] SHAM 4.16+/-0.09 to TAC 7.1+/-0.37, p<0.01. Treatment with rosuvastatin prevented pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy (5.5+/-0.18, p<0.05). TAC induced a 4-fold up-regulation of myocardial NADPH oxidase activity as well as Rac1 activity; both effects were absent in statin-treated animals. In cultured rat cardiomyocytes, treatment with angiotensin II (AngII) increased translocation of Rac1 to cell membranes and Rac1 activity. AngII altered neither expression nor tyrosine phosphorylation of GTPase activating protein GAP-p190 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factors Vav and Tiam. Transaortic constriction as well as AngII increased the binding of Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDIalpha) to Rac1. The association of RhoGDIalpha with Rac1 was mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and depended on geranylgeranylation. Statin treatment inhibited RhoGDIalpha-Rac1 binding both in cultured cardiomyocytes and during myocardial hypertrophy in vivo.

"Human adipose tissue (AT) produces several adipokines including monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Human AT cultures, isolated adipocytes, and stromal-vascular cells were used to investigate the relationship among AT-resident macrophages, MCP-1, and adiposity and the regulation of MCP-1. mRNA levels of specific macrophage markers (CD68 and CD14) are correlated with adiposity in sc AT and visceral AT (P < 0.05). MCP-1 production is higher in stromal-vascular cells vs. adipocytes (P < 0.01) and correlates with macrophage markers in both AT compartments (P < 0.05).

"Cardiovascular mortality is increased in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. A possible explanation might be a more prevalent atherogenic lipid profile in patients with ankylosing spondylitis than in the general population. It has been postulated that inflammation deteriorates the lipid profile, thereby increasing cardiovascular risk. To explore the association between disease activity and lipid profile in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Disease activity parameters for ankylosing spondylitis and lipid levels (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) and triglycerides) were measured in 45 patients with ankylosing spondylitis for 6 months after starting treatment with leflunomide or placebo. Findings in this treatment group were compared with those in 10 patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with etanercept. A specialised regression model, adjusting for repeated measurements, age and sex, was used to assess the influence of the disease activity variables on the lipid levels. Multilevel regression analyses showed significant associations between disease activity parameters and lipid levels-for instance, an increase of 30 mm at the end of the first hour in erythrocyte sedimentation rate was associated with a decrease of about 6% in total cholesterol level and a decrease of about 11% in HDLc levels.

"This study was designed to test the hypothesis that in the presence of moderate hypotension, intraaortic balloon counterpulsation would enhance coronary thrombolysis induced by intravenous administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Although many studies have confirmed the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction, few have systematically investigated the effects of alterations in aortic pressure on coronary thrombolysis, and none have previously investigated the effects of intraaortic balloon counterpulsation on thrombolysis. The effects of intraaortic balloon counterpulsation on aortic pressure, coronary blood flow and coronary thrombolysis were studied in a canine model. Coronary thrombosis was induced in eight dogs by injection of radioactive blood clot through a catheter placed in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Subsequently, dogs underwent phlebotomy to decrease systolic aortic pressure to approximately 90 mm Hg. After phlebotomy, during a 15-min interval of intravenous administration of rt-PA, coronary thrombolysis and coronary flow were determined during and in the absence of counterpulsation.

"To investigate the expression of Gremlin 1 (GREM1), an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovia and its involvement in the hyperplasia and invasiveness of fibroblast-like synoviocytes of RA (RA-FLS). Computational analysis was introduced to identify FLS-predominant regulators. GREM1 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, and ELISA. FLS proliferation and apoptosis were determined using tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay and APOPercentage assay, respectively. FLS migration and invasion were evaluated by wound migration and Matrigel invasion assay, respectively. Expressions of Bax, Bcl2, pErk1/2, and pAkt were detected by Western blot analysis. Through global transcriptome profiling, we identified a GREM1 gene predominantly expressed in RA-FLS. Indeed, the GREM1 expression was higher in synovia, synovial fluids, and FLS of patients with RA than in those of patients with osteoarthritis, and its levels correlated well with proinflammatory cytokine concentrations. Knockdown of GREM1 transcripts using short interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the proliferation and survival of RA-FLS along with downregulation of pErk1/2, pAkt, and Bcl2 expressions, whereas it induced Bax expression. Conversely, the addition of recombinant GREM1 to RA-FLS showed the opposite results. Moreover, GREM1 siRNA decreased the migratory and invasive capacity of RA-FLS, whereas exogenous GREM1 increased it.

"The association between anxiety and depression related traits and dyspepsia may reflect a common genetic predisposition. Furthermore, genetic factors may contribute to the risk of having increased visceral sensitivity, which has been implicated in dyspeptic symptom generation. Serotonin (5-HT) modulates visceral sensitivity by its action on 5-HT3 receptors. Interestingly, a functional polymorphism in HTR3A, encoding the 5-HT3 receptor A subunit, has been reported to be associated with depression and anxiety related traits. A functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter (5-HTT), which terminates serotonergic signalling, was also found associated with these psychiatric comorbidities and increased visceral sensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome, which coexistence is associated with higher dyspeptic symptom severity.

Patients were genotyped for HTR3A c.-42C > T SNP and the 44 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in the 5-HTT promoter (5-HTTLPR). Intensity of 8 dyspeptic symptoms at baseline was assessed using a validated questionnaire (0 = none; 6 = very severe). Sum score ≥20 was defined severe dyspepsia. HTR3A c.-42T allele carriers were more prevalent in patients with severe dyspepsia (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.06-2.20). This association appeared to be stronger in females (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.25-3.39) and patients homozygous for the long (L) variant of the 5-HTTLPR genotype (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.01-3.94). Females with 5-HTTLPR LL genotype showed the strongest association (OR = 3.50, 95% CI = 1.37-8.90).",Is serotonin receptor 3A polymorphism c.-42C > T associated with severe dyspepsia?,"The HTR3A c.-42T allele is associated with severe dyspeptic symptoms.

Moreover, the HTR3A c.-42C > T and 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms likely represent predisposing genetic variants in common to psychiatric morbidity and dyspepsia.",0,Is there a link between the serotonin receptor 3A gene variant c.-42C > T and severe dyspepsia?,26.0,2011.0,2176.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.388935089111328,2.010549783706665,6.476923704147339,"Yes, the serotonin receptor 3A polymorphism c.-42C > T is associated with severe dyspepsia, with carriers of the c.-42T allele being more prevalent in patients with severe dyspepsia (OR 1.50).",0.9
"To investigate diagnostic and prognostic values of sulfite oxidase (SUOX) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent curative resection. We investigated immunohistochemically the expression dynamics of SUOX, aldo-ketoreductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) and CD34 at different stages of HCC. The differential diagnostic performance of three markers or their combinations in high-grade dysplastic nodules (HGDNs) and well-differentiated small HCC (WD-sHCC) were investigated by logistic regression models and validated in an independent testing set. Overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR) were evaluated in 300 patients with HCC as the testing cohort, and validated in 198 patients with HCC. SUOX was decreased and AKR1B10 and CD34 were increased with the stepwise progression of hepatocarcinogenesis. For differential diagnosis of WD-sHCC from HGDNs, the sensitivity and specificity of the SUOX+AKR1B10+CD34 combination for WD-sHCC detection were 93.8% and 95.2%, respectively, and overall accuracy was much higher than any of the three individual markers and two marker combinations. In addition, SUOX, but not AKR1B10 and CD34, was an independent prognostic factor for OS and TTR, and showed better correlation with OS and TTR if combined with serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) for both the testing and validation cohorts.",Is sUOX a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma?,"SUOX+AKR1B10+CD34 combination could make a substantial contribution to hepatic immunopathological diagnosis to distinguish WD-sHCC from HGDNs.

"The active form of vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) has been shown to inhibit development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in IL-10 KO mice. Here, the role of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and 1,25(OH)2D3 in acute experimental IBD was probed. VDR KO mice were extremely sensitive to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and there was increased mortality of the VDR KO mice at doses of DSS that only caused a mild form of colitis in wildtype (WT) mice. DSS colitis in the VDR KO mice was accompanied by high colonic expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-1beta, IL-12, IFN-gamma, IL-10, MIP-1alpha and KC. DSS concentrations as low as 0.5% were enough to induce bleeding, ulceration and weight loss in VDR KO mice. VDR KO mice failed to recover following the removal of DSS, while WT mice showed signs of recovery within 5 days of DSS removal. The early mortality of DSS treated VDR KO mice was likely due to perforation of the bowel and resulting endotoxemia. VDR KO mice were hyper-responsive to exogenously injected LPS and cultures of the peritoneal exudates of moribund DSS treated VDR KO mice were positive for bacterial growth. 1,25(OH)2D3 in the diet or rectally decreased the severity and extent of DSS-induced inflammation in WT mice.",Are vitamin D and the vitamin D receptor critical for control of the innate immune response to colonic injury?,"The data point to a critical role for the VDR and 1,25(OH)2D3 in control of innate immunity and the response of the colon to chemical injury.",0,Is vitamin D and its receptor essential for regulating the innate immune response to colon damage?,17.0,2133.0,2278.0,1.0,0.1666666666666666,0.3562071871080222,1.844866752624512,1.7853450775146484,4.651602506637573,"Yes, vitamin D and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) are critical for the control of the innate immune response to colonic injury, as they play significant roles in regulating inflammation and maintaining intestinal barrier function.",1.0
"The sensory neurons and glia of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) arise from neural crest cells in the developing vertebrate embryo. In mouse and chick, DRG formation is completed during embryogenesis. In contrast, zebrafish continue to add neurons and glia to the DRG into adulthood, long after neural crest migration is complete. The molecular and cellular regulation of late DRG growth in the zebrafish remains to be characterized. In the present study, we use transgenic zebrafish lines to examine neuronal addition during postembryonic DRG growth. Neuronal addition is continuous over the period of larval development. Fate-mapping experiments support the hypothesis that new neurons are added from a population of resident, neural crest-derived progenitor cells.

"Transplantation of vasculogenic progenitor cells (VPC) improves neovascularization after ischemia. However, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus show a reduced VPC number and impaired functional activity. Previously, we demonstrated that p38 kinase inhibition prevents the negative effects of glucose on VPC number by increasing proliferation and differentiation towards the endothelial lineage in vitro. Moreover, the functional capacity of progenitor cells is reduced in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome including type 2 diabetes (Lepr(db)) in vivo. The aim of this study was to elucidate the underlying signalling mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we performed DNA-protein binding arrays in the bone marrow of mice with metabolic syndrome, in blood-derived progenitor cells of diabetic patients as well as in VPC ex vivo treated with high levels of glucose. The transcriptional activation of ETS transcription factors was increased in all samples analyzed. Downregulation of ETS1 expression by siRNA abrogated the reduction of VPC number induced by high-glucose treatment. In addition, we observed a concomitant suppression of the non-endothelial ETS-target genes matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and CD115 upon short term lentiviral delivery of ETS-specific shRNAs.

"Patients with giant-cell arteritis (GCA) who develop a strong acute-phase response are at low risk of disease-related ischemic events. To assess the potential protective role of proinflammatory cytokines in the development of ischemic events in GCA, we measured tissue expression (66 individuals) and/or circulating levels (80 individuals) of interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-6 in patients with biopsy-proven GCA. Tissue expression was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Circulating cytokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay. We found that patients with disease-related ischemic events had lower IL-6 mRNA levels (5.9+/-2.1 versus 27.6+/-7.8 relative units, P=0.013), lower IL-6 immunohistochemical expression scores (1.5+/-0.9 versus 2.7+/-1, P=0.001), and lower circulating levels of IL-6 (13.6+/-2.1 versus 24+/-2.4 pg/mL, P=0.002) than patients without ischemic complications. No significant differences were found for either IL-1beta or TNF-alpha. We subsequently investigated direct effects of IL-6 on vessel wall components.

"Activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 facilitates the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Thus, releasing the wild-type p53 from indirect suppression would be crucial to successful killing of cancer cells by DNA-damaging therapeutic agents. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels on p53 protein in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. More importantly, we were interested to show through which receptor cAMP acts to promote p53 degradation. In cell cultures, we investigated the effects of forskolin/3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) on stimulated p53 of ALL cell lines. Western blotting analysis was performed to detect the expression of p53, phospho-p53, acetylated-p53, phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and Mdm2 proteins. Flow cytometry was applied to analyze apoptosis. The gene expression of p53 and its target genes was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. We show that elevation of cAMP levels in ALL cells exposed to DNA damage attenuates p53 accumulation. Inhibition of proteosome function with MG-132 reversed the inhibitory effect of cAMP on p53. However, targeting the p53-Mdm2 interaction did not rescue accumulated p53 from the destabilizing signal of cAMP.

"p63, a member of the p53 protein family, plays key roles in epithelial development and carcinogenesis. In breast cancer, p63 expression has been found predominantly in basal-A (epithelial-type) triple-negative breast carcinomas (TNBC).

TAp63α did not have significant effect on gene expression profile and cell phenotype, whilst the main effect of ΔNp63α was reduction of cell adhesion. Gene expression profiling revealed genes involved in cell adhesion and migration whose expression relies on overexpression of ΔNp63α.

"The aim was to investigate the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on agonist induced endothelium dependent vasodilatation in vivo. Chronically instrumented conscious dogs (n = 8) were prepared for the measurement of coronary blood flow, diameter of the left circumflex coronary artery, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate. Intracoronary infusions of acetylcholine, adenosine, and bradykinin that induced dose dependent increases in coronary blood flow and diameter were performed with and without intracoronary administration of captopril (1 mg.kg-1) and enalapril (0.4 mg.kg-1). The effects were studied of concomitant inhibition of bradykinin actions by the specific B2 kinin antagonist HOE-140 (10(-7) M), NO-synthesis by NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME, 2 x 10(-5) M), or cyclo-oxygenase by indomethacin (10(-7) M) (all intracoronary). Neither captopril nor enalapril had significant vasodilating effect on the coronary vasculature when given alone. In contrast, both ACE inhibitors potentiated the agonist induced increases in coronary blood flow by bradykinin and acetylcholine (p < or = 0.01). HOE-140 strongly antagonised the effects of infused bradykinin and prevented the potentiation of acetylcholine responses by ACE inhibition. L-NAME caused hypertension and bradycardia and abolished the responses to acetylcholine and adenosine, but only partially attenuated the bradykinin induced increases in coronary blood flow. Simultaneous ACE inhibition reduced the hypertensive effect of L-NAME and partially restored the responses to bradykinin.

"Disabled phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signalling is involved in endometrial carcinogenesis, and there is evidence that expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members has a role in such intracellular signalling pathways. This study analysed the prognostic impact of EGFR family expression in endometrial cancer in relation to PI3K-AKT and MAPK-ERK signalling, as well as drug sensitivity. Immunohistochemical analysis using 63 surgical specimens of endometrioid-type endometrial cancers revealed that EGFR, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 and HER-4 were expressed in 25 (39.7%) of 63, 26 (41.3%) of 63 and 31 (49.2%) of 63 tumours, respectively. Gene amplification of HER-2 was observed in 2 of 26 patients with high HER-2 expression. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high HER-2 expression was a factor that negatively influenced the progression-free and overall survival rate (P<0.05), and multivariate analysis showed high HER-2 expression to be an independent prognostic factor. Subsequently, we performed in vitro knockdown analysis to investigate the linkage between HER-2 expression and PI3K-AKT pathways. Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-based knockdown of HER-2 in endometrial cancer cells led to a significant reduction in phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) expression, indicating the existence of a HER-2/PI3K-AKT axis. As the PI3K-AKT pathway is known to have crucial roles in anticancer drug sensitivity, we examined the involvement of HER-2 in sensitivity to paclitaxel. Short interfering RNA-based knockdown of HER-2 conferred increased sensitivity to paclitaxel in endometrial cancer cells, attenuating the induction of p-AKT on paclitaxel stimulation, which was cancelled by inactivating AKT by the introduction of a dominant-negative form.",Does expression of HER-2 affect patient survival and paclitaxel sensitivity in endometrial cancer?,"HER-2 is a significant prognostic factor of endometrioid-type endometrial cancer, as well as a key molecule that affects paclitaxel sensitivity by HER-2 interaction with the PI3K-AKT pathway.",0,1.

"In the current study, we examine the effects of a novel proteasome inhibitor, NPI-0052 (salinosporamide A), on proteasome function and nuclear factor-kappaB activation and evaluate its ability to enhance treatment response in colon cancer xenografts when administered orally. The effects of treatment on nuclear factor-kappaB activation, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis were determined. The pharmacodynamic effect of NPI-0052 on 20S proteasome function was assayed in vivo following oral and i.v. drug administration and compared with treatment with bortezomib. The effect of combined treatment with chemotherapy was determined in a colon cancer xenograft model. We found that NPI-0052 is a potent, well-tolerated proteasome inhibitor that has pharmacodynamic properties distinct from bortezomib in that it achieves significantly higher and more sustained levels of proteasome inhibition. When combined with chemotherapy, NPI-0052 increases apoptosis and shifts cells toward G2 cell cycle arrest. When added to chemotherapy in vivo [using combinations of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), CPT-11, Avastin (bevacizumab), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin], NPI-0052 significantly improved the tumoricidal response and resulted in a 1.8-fold increased response to CPT-11, 5-FU, and leucovorin triple-drug combination (P=0.0002, t test), a 1.5-fold increased response to the oxaliplatin, 5-FU, and leucovorin triple-drug combination (P=0.013, t test), and a 2.3-fold greater response to the CPT-11, 5-FU, leucovorin, and Avastin regimen (P=0.00057).",Does nPI-0052 enhance tumoricidal response to conventional cancer therapy in a colon cancer model?,The high level of proteasome inhibition achieved by NPI-0052 is well tolerated and significantly improves the tumoricidal response to multidrug treatment in a colon cancer xenograft model.

"Clot buster tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and its end-product plasmin play a well-defined role in neurochemistry. They mediate a number of events that culminate in tolerance against excitotoxicity, hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptic remodeling, neuronal plasticity, cognitive and emotional processing. Abnormalities in these processes have been implicated in schizophrenia pathogenesis. Laboratory markers of low activity of tPA/plasmin were analyzed in 70 schizophrenia adults (DSM-IV), and 98 age-matched controls, consecutively selected at university hospitals. All but two patients had positive markers (1-6, mean 2.1). Twenty-nine patients and 11 controls had hyperinsulinemia (44% vs. 11%) and 20 patients and 11 controls had hypertriglyceridemia (29% vs. 11%). Both insulin and triglycerides stimulate production of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, a major tPA inhibitor. Nineteen patients and six controls had hyperhomocysteinemia (27% vs. 6%), a condition that impairs tPA catalytic activity. Fifteen patients (22%) but no controls had free-protein S deficiency, a condition that reduces PAI-1 inhibition. Twenty-one patients (30%) but no controls had 1-3 antiphospholipid antibodies in medium or/high levels. Such antibodies are able to inhibit tPA/plasmin activity. Both PAI-1 polymorphism 4G/5G and heterozygous prothrombin G20210A were more prevalent in patients (60% vs. 48% and 2% vs. 1%, respectively), but difference lacked significance.

"Skeletal muscle atrophy in rodents is associated with increased gene expression of proteolytic markers muscle-RING-finger protein 1 (MuRF-1) and atrogin-1. In humans with age-related muscle atrophy, known as sarcopenia, little is known about these key proteolytic biomarkers. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was 2-fold: (i) measure messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of proteolytic genes MuRF-1, atrogin-1, forkhead box (FOXO)3A, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in young and old women at rest, and (ii) measure these proteolytic genes in response to an acute resistance exercise (RE) bout, a known hypertrophic stimulus. A group of old women (OW: n =6, 85+/-1 years, thigh muscle =89+/-4 cm(2)) and young women (YW: n=8, 23+/-2 years, thigh muscle = 122+/-6 cm(2)) performed three sets of 10 knee extensions at 70% of one-repetition maximum. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis before and 4 hours after RE. Using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), mRNA was amplified and normalized to GAPDH. At rest, OW expressed higher mRNA levels of MuRF-1 (p=.04) and FOXO3A (p=.001) compared to YW. In response to RE, there was an age effect (p=.01) in the induction of atrogin-1 (OW: 2.5-fold).

"We previously reported the expression of the two-pore-domain K channel TREK-1 in lung epithelial cells and proposed a role for this channel in the regulation of alveolar epithelial cytokine secretion. In this study, we focused on investigating the role of TREK-1 in vivo in the development of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Laboratory animal experiments. University research laboratory. Wild-type and TREK-1-deficient mice. Mice were anesthetized and exposed to 1) room air, no mechanical ventilation, 2) 95% hyperoxia for 24 hours, and 3) 95% hyperoxia for 24 hours followed by mechanical ventilation for 4 hours. Hyperoxia exposure accentuated lung injury in TREK-1-deficient mice but not controls, resulting in increase in lung injury scores, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cell numbers, and cellular apoptosis and a decrease in quasi-static lung compliance. Exposure to a combination of hyperoxia and injurious mechanical ventilation resulted in further morphological lung damage and increased lung injury scores and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cell numbers in control but not TREK-1-deficient mice. At baseline and after hyperoxia exposure, bronchoalveolar lavage cytokine levels were unchanged in TREK-1-deficient mice compared with controls. Exposure to hyperoxia and mechanical ventilation resulted in an increase in bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α levels in both mouse types, but the increase in interleukin-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 levels was less prominent in TREK-1-deficient mice than in controls. Lung tissue macrophage inflammatory protein-2, keratinocyte-derived cytokine, and interleukin-1β gene expression was not altered by hyperoxia in TREK-1-deficient mice compared with controls.

"Clinical studies have shown that enteral immune-enhancing diets (IEDs) containing l-glutamine decrease septic complications and length of stay in some patient populations. Animal studies suggest IED benefits might include augmented gut blood flow. We hypothesized that enteral glutamine supplementation modulates gastrointestinal blood flow. Blood flow was measured in male Sprague-Dawley rats via the colorimetric microsphere technique at baseline, 60, and 120 minutes. Four groups were studied: (1) control diet (CD) + enteral glutamine; (2) CD + enteral glycine; (3) CD + enteral saline; and (4) CD + intravenous glutamine. There were no differences in blood pressure or heart rate in any group.

"The glomerular endothelial cell is a specialized microvascular cell type involved in the regulation of glomerular ultrafiltration. During gram-negative sepsis, glomerulonephritis, and acute renal failure, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) may cause severe cell damage. Our aim was to study and compare the direct effects of TNF-alpha and LPS on the induction of apoptosis in bovine glomerular endothelial cells. Primary bovine glomerular endothelial cells were stimulated with TNF-alpha or LPS, and apoptotic cell death was investigated by DNA fragmentation analysis, morphological studies, measurement of cytochrome c efflux and mitochondrial permeability transition, Bak, Bad, Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL protein expression, and caspase-3-like protease activity. TNF-alpha, as well as LPS, elicited apoptotic cell death both time and concentration dependently. Along with DNA ladder formation, we detected the formation of 50 kbp high molecular weight DNA fragments, nuclear condensation, and mitochondrial permeability transition. Concerning all parameters, LPS signaling proved to be more rapid than TNF-alpha. Mechanistically, TNF-alpha-induced cell death was preceded by an efflux of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol and, subsequently, by a marked increase in the proapoptotic protein Bak and a decrease in the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein content. Comparable but more pronounced effects were seen with LPS. Later, caspase-3-like protease activity was first detectable after 10 hours and was continuously increased up to 24 hours in both TNF-alpha- and LPS-stimulated cells. Correspondingly, we detected an extended cleavage of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Caspase inhibitors Z-Asp-CH2-DCB and Z-VAD-fmk blocked both TNF-alpha- and LPS-induced apoptosis in a comparable manner.

"Infants with abusive head trauma (AHT) have diffuse brain damage with potentially fatal brain swelling. The pathogenesis of the brain damage remains unclear. We hypothesize that brain damage in AHT is due to hypoxic-ischemic injury with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) rather than primary traumatic brain injury (TBI) with traumatic diffuse axonal injury (tDAI). We studied brain tissue of AHT victims. Primary outcome measure was the presence of primary traumatic versus hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. The diagnosis of tDAI followed a standardized semiquantitative diagnostic approach yielding a 4-tiered grading scheme (definite, possible, improbable, and none). In addition, results of quantitative immunohistochemical analysis in a subgroup of AHT victims with instant death were compared with matched SIDS controls. In our cohort of 50 AHT victims, none had definite tDAI (no tDAI in 30, tDAI possible in 2, and tDAI improbable in 18). Instead, all AHT victims showed morphological findings indicative of HIE.

"Elevated blood pressure (BP) levels are well recognized after acute stroke and are associated with increased BP variability. The underlying mechanisms producing such changes are unclear but may include abnormalities of baroreceptor-mediated control of heart rate and vasomotor tone. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) can be used to assess the integrity of ""low-pressure"" cardiopulmonary and ""high-pressure"" arterial baroreceptor-derived responses by inducing nonhypotensive and hypotensive stimuli. Cardiovascular responses, including BP, heart rate, forearm blood flow, and forearm vascular resistance, to nonhypotensive and hypotensive LBNP were assessed in 13 consecutive stroke patients. Patients were studied within 72 hours of stroke (acute) and again at 10 to 14 days (subacute) and were compared with 13 control subjects individually matched for age, sex, and BP. At an LBNP of -10 mm Hg, BP was unchanged in all groups, but a significant increase in forearm vascular resistance occurred only in the control group (11 U [interquartile range, 7 to 15]; P < .05) compared with stroke patients in the acute (9 U [3 to 14]; P = NS) or subacute phases (7 U [2 to 12]; P = NS).

"The effects of isoflurane pretreatment on pulmonary proinflammatory cytokines and survival in severe endotoxin-induced acute lung injury (ALI) have not been studied systemically. We investigated the effect of preadministration of isoflurane on ALI induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: sham rats (injected intraperitoneally [IP] with saline) pretreated with vehicle (100% O(2)) (sham-vehicle); sham rats pretreated with isoflurane (sham-ISO); LPS rats (injected IP with LPS) pretreated with vehicle (vehicle-LPS); and LPS rats pretreated with isoflurane (ISO-LPS). Endotoxemia was induced by IP injection of LPS. Isoflurane 1.4% was administered 30 min before LPS injection. The animals were then observed for 6 h. We monitored arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and blood gas. The extent of ALI was evaluated by lung wet/dry ratio, Evans blue dye extravasation, and histologic examination. We also measured pulmonary nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 levels. In addition, survival statistics and pulmonary inducible NO synthase (iNOS) gene expression were also determined. LPS caused systemic hypotension and severe ALI, as evidenced by the increases in the extent of ALI, impairment of pulmonary functions, and increases in pulmonary NO, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6. Isoflurane preconditioning mitigated systemic hypotension and the development of ALI.

Rats in the glibenclamide group were intraperitoneally administered glibenclamide with a loading dose of 10 μg/kg at 10 minutes and a maintenance dose of 1.2 μg at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation, whereas rats in the vehicle group received equivalent volume of vehicle solution. Survival was recorded every day, and neurologic deficit scores were assessed at 24, 48, and 72 hours and 7 days after return of spontaneous circulation (n = 22 in each group). Results showed that glibenclamide treatment increased 7-day survival rate, reduced neurologic deficit scores, and prevented neuronal loss in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 region. To investigate the neuroprotective effects of glibenclamide in acute phase, we observed neuronal injury at 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation and found that glibenclamide significantly decreased the rate of neuronal necrosis and apoptosis. In addition, glibenclamide reduced the messenger RNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in the cortex after return of spontaneous circulation. Furthermore, the sulfonylurea receptor 1 and transient receptor potential M4 heteromers, the putative therapeutic targets of glibenclamide, were up-regulated after cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, indicating that they might be involved in neuroprotective effect of glibenclamide.",Does glibenclamide improve Survival and Neurologic Outcome After Cardiac Arrest in Rats?,"Glibenclamide treatment substantially improved survival and neurologic outcome throughout a 7-day period after return of spontaneous circulation.

"Obesity is known to be associated with prostate cancer development and progression, but the detailed mechanism is not clear. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) is secreted from cancer cells, stromal cells, and adipocytes, and it is involved in prostate cancer progression. Here we investigated the biological role of MCP-1 secreted from adipocytes for prostate cancer cells. Human pre-adipocytes (HPAds) were cultured and differentiated to mature adipocytes. Conditioned medium (CM) from HPAd cells was obtained using phenol red-free RPMI1640 medium. We performed a cytokine membrane array analysis to detect cytokines in the CM. To characterize the physiological function of MCP-1 in the CM, we performed an MTT-assay, a wound-healing and invasion assay with anti-MCP-1 antibody using three prostate cancer cell lines: DU145, LNCaP, and PC-3. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activities were evaluated by gelatin zymography. A qPCR and Western blotting were used to examine the mRNA and protein expression levels of MMP-2. The cytokine membrane array of the CM showed a strong signal of MCP-1compared to the control medium, and we thus focused our attention on MCP-1 in the CM. The CM up-regulated the cancer cell proliferation, and the neutralization by anti-MCP-1 antibody inhibited the proliferative effect of the prostate cancer cell lines. The CM greatly increased the invasive activity in the prostate cancer cell lines, and anti-MCP-1 antibody decreased the invasiveness. Gelatin zymography revealed that the CM markedly enhanced the enzymatic activity of MMP-2, and anti-MCP-1 antibody down-regulated its effect. MMP-2 mRNA expression was undetected and the MMP-2 protein level was unchanged between the control medium and CM in DU145 cells.",Does adipocyte-derived monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) promote prostate cancer progression through the induction of MMP-2 activity?,MCP-1 from adipocytes enhances the growth and invasion activity of prostate cancer cells.

"To investigate the anti-apoptotic effect of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the placenta of rats with preeclampsia-like symptoms. Thirty pregnant Wistar rats were randomized equally into 3 groups and received subcutaneous saline injection (control group), 200 mg/kg L-NAME injection to induce preeclampsia symptoms (PE group), or L-NAME with 40 µl/kg LMWH injections (LMWH group). The blood pressure, urine protein, the number of pups and the weight of the fetuses and placenta were measured, and the placental apoptotic index was measured by TUNEL assay. The expression of cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax in the placenta were examined by Western blotting. Compared with the control group, L-NAME injections caused significantly increased blood pressure and urine protein (P<0.05), which were significantly lowered by LWMH (P<0.05). The number and weight of normal pups were significantly lower in PE group than in the control group (P<0.05) and LMWH group (P<0.05); in LMWH group, the weight of pups was still lower than that of the control group (P<0.05) but the number of normal pups was comparable (P>0.05). The LMWH group showed a significantly lower placental apoptosis index than the PE group (P<0.05) with also significantly lower cleaved caspase-3 and Bax and higher Bcl-2 expressions (P<0.05).

"The early clinical trials using fetal ventral mesencephalic (VM) allografts in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have shown efficacy (albeit not in all cases) and have paved the way for further development of cell replacement therapy strategies in PD. The preclinical work that led to these clinical trials used allografts of fetal VM tissue placed into 6-OHDA lesioned rats, while the patients received similar allografts under cover of immunosuppression in an α-synuclein disease state. Thus developing models that more faithfully replicate the clinical scenario would be a useful tool for the translation of such cell-based therapies to the clinic. Here, we show that while providing functional recovery, transplantation of fetal dopamine neurons into the AAV-α-synuclein rat model of PD resulted in smaller-sized grafts as compared to similar grafts placed into the 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum. Additionally, we found that cyclosporin treatment was able to promote the survival of the transplanted cells in this allografted state and surprisingly also provided therapeutic benefit in sham-operated animals. We demonstrated that delayed cyclosporin treatment afforded neurorestoration in three complementary models of PD including the Thy1-α-synuclein transgenic mouse, a novel AAV-α-synuclein mouse model, and the MPTP mouse model. We then explored the mechanisms for this benefit of cyclosporin and found it was mediated by both cell-autonomous mechanisms and non-cell autonomous mechanisms.",Does cyclosporin promote neurorestoration and cell replacement therapy in pre-clinical models of Parkinson 's disease?,"This study provides compelling evidence in favor for the use of immunosuppression in all grafted PD patients receiving cell replacement therapy, regardless of the immunological mismatch between donor and host cells, and also suggests that cyclosporine treatment itself may act as a disease-modifying therapy in all PD patients.",0,Does cyclosporine facilitate neural recovery and cell regeneration techniques in preclinical studies of Parkinson's disease?,21.0,2206.0,2374.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3439981937408447,1.6472086906433103,4.028324127197266,"The provided context does not mention cyclosporin or its effects on neurorestoration and cell replacement therapy in pre-clinical models of Parkinson's disease.

"CXCL12 exerts a wide variety of chemotactic effects on cells. Evidence indicates that CXCL12, in conjunction with its receptor, CXCR4, promotes invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Our objective was to explore whether the CXCL12-CXCR4 biological axis might influence biological behavior of pancreatic cancer cells. Miapaca-2 human pancreatic cancer cells were cultured under three different conditions: normal medium (control), medium + recombinant CXCL12 (CXCL12 group), or medium + CXCR4-inhibitor AMD3100 (AMD3100 group). RT-PCR was applied to detect mRNA expression levels of CXCL12, CXCR4, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and human urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). Additionally, cell proliferation and invasion were performed using CCK-8 colorimetry and transwell invasion assays, respectively. CXCL12 was not expressed in Miapaca-2 cells, but CXCR4 was detected, indicating that these cells are capable of receiving signals from CXCL12. Expression of extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes MMP-2, MMP- 9, and uPA was upregulated in cells exposed to exogenous CXCL12 (P<0.05). Additionally, both proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells were enhanced in the presence of exogenous CXCL12, but AMD3100 intervention effectively inhibited these processes (P<0.05).",Does cXCL12-CXCR4 promote proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells?,The CXCL12-CXCR4 biological axis plays an important role in promoting proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells.,0,Does cXCL12-CXCR4 enhance the growth and infiltration of pancreatic carcinoma cells?,19.0,2144.0,2264.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.3470311164855957,1.6014618873596191,4.0644707679748535,"Yes, CXCL12-CXCR4 promotes proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells.",1.0
"To investigate the effects of N-acetylcysteine on D-galactosamine (GalN)/ lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced apoptotic liver injury in mice. When given together with a low dose of LPS, GalN highly sensitizes animals to produce apoptotic liver injury with severe hepatic congestion, resulting in rapid death. In the GalN/LPS model, TNF-alpha is the major mediator leading to apoptotic liver injury. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in GalN-induced sensitization to TNF-alpha-evoked hepatocyte apoptosis. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant and a glutathione (GSH) precursor. In this study, we investigated the effects of NAC on LPS-induced apoptotic liver injury in GalN-sensitized mice. Pretreatment with NAC significantly reduced GalN/LPS-induced elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase levels. In parallel, GalN/LPS-induced hepatic necrosis and congestion were obviously improved by NAC. Furthermore, NAC pretreatment significantly alleviated GalN/LPS-induced hepatic apoptosis, measured by the inhibition of hepatic caspase-3 activity and attenuation of DNA laddering. NAC pretreatment had no effect on LPS-evoked nitric oxide production in GalN-sensitized mice. Increases in serum TNF-alpha concentration, which were observed in GalN/LPS-treated mice, were not significantly reduced by NAC. Although NAC pretreatment significantly alleviated LPS-induced hepatic GSH depletion, DL-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine, an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, did not influence the protective effect of NAC on GalN/LPS-induced apoptotic liver injury.",Does n-acetylcysteine attenuate lipopolysaccharide-induced apoptotic liver damage in D-galactosamine-sensitized mice?,NAC attenuates GalN/LPS-induced apoptotic liver injury via its strong ROS scavenging and anti-apoptotic effects.,0,1.

"The important role of surgery in early-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been recognized, and curative surgical resection is recommended. However, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage I SCLC has not yet been evaluated, and novel approaches focusing on the specific genomic characteristics of SCLC may be invaluable for customized therapy. In this study, we focused on the Klotho gene, which is an anti-aging gene known to be a potential tumor suppressor. We investigated whether the expression of Klotho, assessed by immunohistochemistry, can predict survival in patients with resected SCLC. The medical records of patients diagnosed as having limited-disease (LD) SCLC and treated by surgical resection (n=30) at Tokyo Medical University Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The expression status of Klotho, and of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters MRP1, MDR and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), which can cause resistance to anticancer drugs, including irinotecan, was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis in resected surgical specimens of patients with early-stage SCLC. Of the 30 patients, Klotho expression was seen in the specimens from 18 patients (60.0%), but not in those of the remaining 12 patients (40.0%). The immunostaining for Klotho was mostly localized in the cytoplasm. The expression of Klotho was significantly associated with the overall survival (OS) (ratio 0.088; 95% confidence interval 0.019-0.409; P=0.002). The administration of perioperative chemotherapy had no significant effect in improving the survival, as assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. However, the patients showing Klotho expression in the resected specimens in p-stage I and II, may have benefited from perioperative chemotherapy. A multivariate analysis revealed no significant association between the expression status of MRP1, MDR or BCRP and the OS.",Does klotho predict good clinical outcome in patients with limited-disease small cell lung cancer who received surgery?,"Expression of Klotho was predictive of a favorable outcome following resection in limited-disease SCLC patients, and the Klotho expression status may serve as a new biomarker for the need of additional therapies to be developed in the future.",0,1.

"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a disruptive and persistent side effect of cancer treatment with paclitaxel. Recent reports showed that paclitaxel treatment results in the activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and increased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) in dorsal root ganglion cells. In this study, we sought to determine whether an important consequence of this signaling and also a key step in the CIPN phenotype was the recruitment and infiltration of macrophages into dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Here, we show that macrophage infiltration does occur in a time course that matches the onset of the behavioral CIPN phenotype in Sprague-Dawley rats. Moreover, depletion of macrophages by systemic administration of liposome-encapsulated clodronate (clophosome) partially reversed behavioral signs of paclitaxel-induced CIPN as well as reduced tumor necrosius factor α expression in DRG. Intrathecal injection of MCP-1 neutralizing antibodies reduced paclitaxel-induced macrophage recruitment into the DRG and also blocked the behavioral signs of CIPN. Intrathecal treatment with the TLR4 antagonist lipopolysaccharide-RS (LPS-RS) blocked mechanical hypersensitivity, reduced MCP-1 expression, and blocked the infiltration of macrophages into the DRG in paclitaxel-treated rats. The inhibition of macrophage infiltration into DRG after paclitaxel treatment with clodronate or LPS-RS prevented the loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENFs) observed after paclitaxel treatment alone. These results are the first to indicate a mechanistic link such that activation of TLR4 by paclitaxel leads to increased expression of MCP-1 by DRG neurons resulting in macrophage infiltration to the DRG that express inflammatory cytokines and the combination of these events results in IENF loss and the development of behavioral signs of CIPN.",Does dorsal Root Ganglion Infiltration by Macrophages contribute to Paclitaxel Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy?,"This paper shows that activation of innate immunity by paclitaxel results in a sequence of signaling events that results in the infiltration of the dorsal root ganglia by activated macrophages.

"Complement factor H (Cfh) is a key regulator of the alternative complement pathway. A Cfh variant (Y402H) increases the risk for AMD. The purpose of this study was to develop a pathophysiologically relevant animal model of AMD based on this genetic risk factor. The authors generated chimeric Cfh transgenic mouse lines using two constructs consisting of the human CFH sequence for SCR6-8 (with either 402Y or 402H), flanked by the mouse sequence for SCR1-5 and SCR9-20. They tested the expression of the transgenic mRNA and protein molecules and examined the mice at 12 to 14 months of age for clinical and histologic retinal changes. Nuclease protection assay and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated transgenic mRNA expression in the liver and in the posterior segment of the eye. Western blot analysis showed that the transgenic proteins are present in the circulation at levels comparable to those of mouse Cfh. The chimeric proteins were found to be functional, as demonstrated by their ability to restore physiological serum levels of complement component C3 in Cfh KO mice. Clinical examination showed subretinal drusen-like deposits. Histology demonstrated an accumulation of subretinal cells that stained with a macrophage/microglia marker.

"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) heterodimerizes and shares common signaling pathways with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In this study, we investigated the clinical implication of amphiregulin, a ligand for EGFR, on trastuzumab therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer. Serum amphiregulin levels were quantified in 50 consecutive patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who received first-line trastuzumab plus taxane chemotherapy between October 2004 and July 2009. In addition, in vitro experiments were carried out to validate the results. The median serum amphiregulin level was 1.0 ng/mL with a maximum level of 4.4 ng/mL. Patients with high serum amphiregulin levels (≥0.5 ng/mL) had significantly shorter progression-free survival (15.1 months vs. not reached; P = 0.018). Colony-forming assays demonstrated that the addition of amphiregulin resulted in increased proliferation of cells. In addition, the anti-proliferative effect of trastuzumab was decreased in the presence of amphiregulin. Western blot analysis showed that amphiregulin activated AKT and ERK pathways.

"As sessile organisms, plants adapt to adverse environmental conditions by quickly adjusting cell physiology and metabolism. Transient depolymerization of interphase microtubules is triggered by various acute stresses and biotic interactions with pathogenic organisms. Although rapid remodeling of plant microtubule arrays in response to external stresses is an intriguing phenomenon, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the advantages of this response to plant performance are poorly understood. A domain with weak homology to the slime mold actin-fragmin kinase in the Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase PROPYZAMIDE-HYPERSENSITIVE 1 (PHS1) is a Mn2+-dependent kinase. This atypical kinase domain phosphorylates Thr349 of α-tubulin at the longitudinal interdimer interface, thereby generating a polymerization-incompetent isoform, and effectively depolymerizes microtubule arrays when ectopically expressed in plant or animal cells.

"Iron overload is common in the livers of alcoholics and may play a role in disease pathogenesis. An MHC like gene, HFE, has recently been identified that is mutated in most patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (C282Y in 90% and H63D in 45% of the remainder). To examine the hypothesis that these mutations determine hepatic iron status in alcoholics and play a role in pre-disposition to advanced alcoholic liver disease. The HFE gene was genotyped in 257 patients with alcoholic liver disease and 117 locally matched healthy volunteers. In addition, iron staining was scored (0-4) on biopsy specimens from fibrotic/cirrhotic patients with and without HFE mutations matched for age and sex. Some 15.7% of fibrotic/cirrhotic patients were C282Y heterozygotes compared with 13.7% of controls (p = 0.77). One control and three patients were C282Y homozygotes.

"Myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation determines vascular contractile status. In addition to the classic Ca²⁺-dependent MLC kinase (MLCK), another unidentified kinase(s) also contributes to MLC phosphorylation in living cells.

In the present study, we showed that recombinant IKK2-phosphorylated MLC and intact myosin in vitro, and the kinetic parameters were comparable with those of the classic MLCK. Overexpression of IKK2 increased cellular MLC phosphorylation level, and pharmacological inhibition of IKK2 markedly decreased vascular smooth muscle cell MLC phosphorylation, suggesting that IKK2 is an MLCK in living cells.

"Not all patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) respond equally to neo-adjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT). Patients with highly apoptotic less advanced rectal cancers do not benefit from short-term radiotherapy. This study investigates whether this is also the case in the setting of RCT for LARC.

"Graves ophthalmopathy (GO) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by increased adipogenesis and hyaluronan (HA) production by orbital fibroblasts. Circulating autoantibodies (thyroid-stimulating antibodies [TSAbs]) directed at the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) on these cells stimulate or augment these cellular processes. A recently developed drug-like small molecule inverse agonist of TSHR, NCGC00229600, termed 1, binds to TSHR and blocks basal and stimulated signal transduction. The purpose of this article was to determine whether 1 might inhibit HA production and relevant signaling pathways in orbital fibroblasts cultured in the presence of monoclonal TSAbs or bovine TSH (bTSH). Primary cultures of undifferentiated GO orbital fibroblasts (n = 13) were untreated or treated with a TSAb (M22 or MS-1) or bTSH in serum-free medium, with or without 1 or a TSHR neutral antagonist, NCGC00242595, termed 2, which does not inhibit basal signaling but does inhibit stimulated signaling. cAMP production, Akt phosphorylation (Ser473pAkt in media and immunoblotting for pAkt/total Akt), and HA production were analyzed. Compound 1 inhibited basal cAMP, pAkt, and HA production and that stimulated by M22 in undifferentiated orbital fibroblasts. Inhibition of HA production was dose-dependent, with a half-maximal inhibitory dose of 830 nM. This compound also inhibited MS-1- and bTSH-stimulated cAMP, pAkt, and HA production.

"The sensitivity of the intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel lymph node (SLN) micrometastases and the metastases of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is low. The goal of the current study was to assess whether the use of intraoperative, rapid immunohistochistochemistry (IHC) enhances the intraoperative detection of micrometastases and metastases of ILC. The sensitivity of the intraoperative diagnosis of SLN metastasis was evaluated in 438 patients when using rapid IHC with a cytokeratin biomarker. The results were compared with those obtained for 557 patients without rapid IHC but with conventional staining. For patients with ILC, the sensitivity of the intraoperative diagnosis was 87% (45 of 52) in the IHC group and 66% (39 of 59) in the non-IHC group (P = 0.02).

"Candidate gene studies on the basis of biological hypotheses have been a practical approach to identify relevant genetic variation in complex traits. Based on previous reports and the roles in pain pathways, we have examined the effects of variations of loci in the genes of monoamine neurotransmitter systems including metabolizing enzymes, receptors and transporters on acute clinical pain responses in humans. Variations in the catecholamine metabolizing enzyme genes (MAOA and COMT) showed significant associations with the maximum post-operative pain rating while the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) showed association with the onset time of post-operative pain. Analgesic onset time after medication was significantly associated with the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2). However, the association between COMT genetic variation and pain sensitivity in our study differ from previous studies with small sample sizes, population stratification and pain phenotype derived from combining different types of pain stimuli.

"In a previous study, we found that melatonin inhibits MG-63 osteosarcoma cell proliferation; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt signaling pathways play key roles in the anticancer effects of melatonin. The present study investigated whether MAPK and Akt signaling pathways are involved in melatonin's antiproliferative actions on the human MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. Western blot analysis confirmed that melatonin significantly inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but not p38, JNK, or Akt. The expression of ERK1/2, p38, JNK, and Akt was not altered by melatonin. PD98059 and melatonin alone, and especially in combination, significantly inhibited cell proliferation. The changes included G1 and G2/M phase arrest of the cell cycle, and a downregulation of the expression at both the protein and mRNA levels of cyclin D1 and CDK4 (related to the G1 phase) and of cyclin B1 and CDK1 (related to the G2/M phase) as measured by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining, and both western blot and real-time PCR, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of PD98059 and melatonin synergistically and markedly augmented the action of either agent alone.

"Past work has demonstrated that kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures could cause the enhancement of excitation and lead to neuronal death in rat hippocampus. To counteract such an imbalance between excitation and inhibition, we designed experiments by activating the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor to investigate whether such activation suppresses the excitatory glutamate signaling induced by KA and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Muscimol coapplied with baclofen was intraperitoneally administrated to the rats 40 min before KA injection by intracerebroventricular infusion. Subsequently we used a series of methods including immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, histologic analysis, and immunohistochemistry to analyze the interaction, expression, and phosphorylation of relevant proteins as well as the survival of the CA1/CA3 pyramidal neurons.

"The Notch pathway plays a key role in stimulating mammalian cardiomyocyte proliferation during development and in the early postnatal life; in adult zebrafish, reactivation of this pathway is also essential to drive cardiac regeneration after injury. We wanted to assess efficacy of Notch pathway stimulation in neonatal and adult hearts as a means to induce cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction in mice. In early postnatal life, cardiomyocyte exit from the cell cycle was paralleled by decreased Notch signaling and the establishment of a repressive chromatin environment at Notch-responsive genes, characterized by recruitment of the polycomb group enhancer of zeste homolog 2 methyltransferase and the acquisition of the histone 3 Lysine 27 trimethylation histone mark, as detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Forced Notch pathway activation by adenoassociated virus gene transfer of activated Notch1 or its ligand Jagged1 expanded the proliferative capacity of neonatal cardiomyocytes; this correlated with increased transcription of Notch target genes and maintenance of an open chromatin conformation at their promoters. The same adenoassociated virus vectors, however, were largely ineffective in stimulating cardiac repair after myocardial infarction in adult mice, despite optimal and long-lasting transgene expression. Analysis of Notch-responsive promoters in adult cardiomyocytes showed marks of repressed chromatin and irreversible CpG DNA methylation.

"Polymyxin B (PLB) is a cationic antibiotic that also stoichiometrically neutralizes the lipid A moiety of endotoxin. We examined effects of a small dose of PLB on the mortality of rats with cecal ligation and puncture, on LPS-stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production, and on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) production by isolated rat Kupffer cells. In vivo studies: Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was performed under anesthesia in 28 rats. One hour after CLP, either 600 U/kg of PLB or saline was administered intramuscularly every 6 h (PLB group: n = 12; control group: n = 16). Plasma endotoxin was measured at 3 and 24 h after the CLP by the Endospecy test. This was compared with survival. Kupffer cells were isolated from the normal rat liver. The cells were incubated with LPS or LPS + PLB. After 24 h, NO and TNF alpha content were measured using the Griess and ELISA methods, respectively.

"Mast cell tryptase can stimulate peripheral mononuclear cells activation to cause widespread inflammation. However, the influence of tryptase on microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, remains uninvestigated. Since microglia plays a pivotal role in immune surveillance of CNS, we studied the effect of tryptase on microglia activation. Induction of microglia activation by tryptase was examined with primary cultured microglia. TNF-alpha and IL-6 was measured with a commercial ELISA kit. Intracellular ROS was determined by dichlorodihydrofluorescein oxidation. Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed with the MitoProbe™ JC-1 assay kit. And MAPK and NF-kappa B phosphorylation were evaluated by Western blot. We found that tryptase stimulated microglia activation and subsequently produced proinflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-6 and ROS.

Wild-type (Wt) and mast cell-deficient Kit(w-sh) mice on a C57BL/6 background were repetitively exposed to HDM via the airways. HDM challenge resulted in a rise in tryptase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of Wt mice, indicative of mast cell activation. Kit(w-sh) mice showed a strongly attenuated HDM- induced recruitment of eosinophils in BALF and lung tissue, accompanied by reduced pulmonary levels of the eosinophil chemoattractant eotaxin.

"Notch signalling is essential for blood vessel formation. During angiogenesis, the Notch ligand DLL4 on the leading tip cell activates Notch receptors on the adjacent stalk cells. DLL4-Notch signalling is impaired by the Notch ligand JAG1 in endothelial cells. The Delta/Serrate/Lag2 (DSL) domain of the Notch ligands binds to the EGF-like repeats 11-13 of the Notch receptor. This study aimed to elucidate how soluble proteins containing these short domains interfere with Notch signalling during angiogenesis. Adenoviral vectors were generated to express the DSL domains of DLL1, DLL4, JAG1, and the Notch1 EGF-like repeats 11-13 fused to immunoglobulin-G heavy chain. These soluble ligand peptides inhibited Notch signalling in endothelial cells and this caused hyperbranching in cellular angiogenesis assays and in the neonatal mouse retina.

"MerTK tyrosine kinase is ectopically expressed in 30-50% of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) and over 80% of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) and is a potential therapeutic target. Here, we evaluated the utility of UNC2025, a MerTK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for treatment of acute leukemia. Pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo assays using cell lines and primary leukemia patient samples were utilized to evaluate anti-leukemic effect of UNC2025. UNC2025 potently inhibited pro-survival signaling, induced apoptosis and reduced proliferation and colony formation in MerTK-expressing ALL and AML cell lines and patient samples. Approximately 30% of primary leukemia patient samples (78 of 261 total) were sensitive to UNC2025. Sensitive samples were most prevalent in the AML, T-ALL, and minimally differentiated (M0) AML subsets. UNC2025 inhibited MerTK in bone marrow leukemia cells and had significant therapeutic effects in xenograft models, with dose-dependent decreases in tumor burden and consistent two-fold increases in median survival, irrespective of starting disease burden. In a patient-derived AML xenograft model, treatment with UNC2025 induced disease regression. Additionally, UNC2025 increased sensitivity to methotrexate in vivo, suggesting that addition of MerTK-targeted therapy to current cytotoxic regimens may be particularly effective and/or allow for chemotherapy dose reduction.","Is uNC2025 , a MerTK small molecule inhibitor , therapeutically effective alone and in combination with methotrexate in leukemia models?","The broad spectrum activity mediated by UNC2025 in leukemia patient samples and xenograft models, alone or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, support continued development of MerTK inhibitors for treatment of leukemia.",0,"Is uNC2025, a MerTK inhibitor, effective on its own and alongside methotrexate in models of leukemia?",26.0,2357.0,2562.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.8023169040679927,4.452378511428833,7.28440523147583,"Yes, UNC2025, a MerTK small molecule inhibitor, is therapeutically effective alone and in combination with methotrexate in leukemia models, as it potently inhibited pro-survival signaling, induced apoptosis, and reduced proliferation in MerTK-expressing leukemia cell lines and patient samples.

"To determine whether first-degree relatives of individuals with type 2 diabetes, who are at high risk of subsequently developing hyperglycemia, manifest alterations in beta-cell function including an alteration in the co-release of insulin and amylin. In 30 first-degree relatives and 24 matched subjects with no family history of diabetes, beta-cell function was measured as the intravenous glucose-induced acute insulin response (AIR(g)) and acute amylin response (AAR(g)). The insulin sensitivity index (S(I)) was quantified and used to account for the role of insulin sensitivity to modulate beta-cell function (S(I) x beta-cell function).

"Application of nucleus pulposus and disc related cytokines in vitro on cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells. To study if tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) may induce similar inhibition of axonal outgrowth from cultured DRG cells as application of nucleus pulposus and to compare a new assessment method to previous data. Pro-inflammatory cytokines related to the intervertebral disc have been suggested to affect adversely neurons following local application, with implications for the nucleus pulposus-induced nerve injury seen in various studies. Nucleus pulposus is known to inhibit axonal outgrowth from cultured DRG cells, thereby indicating a neurotoxic potential. The mechanisms were not understood, but it was suspected that the effect was mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the nucleus pulposus. DRG were harvested from newborn rats and put in culture. The axonal outgrowth was determined 24 hours after starting the culture. Twenty-four hours after exposing the cultured cells to nucleus pulposus, frozen nucleus pulposus, TNF, or IL-1beta, the axonal outgrowth was reassessed, and the outgrowth during the exposure time was calculated. Nucleus pulposus clearly reduced the axonal outgrowth. Also, application of TNF and IL-1beta reduced the outgrowth but not as pronounced as the nucleus pulposus.

"Bacillus cereus group isolates that produce diarrheal or emetic toxins are frequently isolated from raw milk and, in spore form, can survive pasteurization. Several species within the B. cereus group are closely related and cannot be reliably differentiated by established taxonomical criteria. While B. cereus is traditionally recognized as the principal causative agent of foodborne disease in this group, there is a need to better understand the distribution and expression of different toxin and virulence genes among B. cereus group food isolates to facilitate reliable characterization that allows for assessment of the likelihood of a given isolate to cause a foodborne disease. We performed whole genome sequencing of 22 B. cereus group dairy isolates, which represented considerable genetic diversity not covered by other isolates characterized to date. Maximum likelihood analysis of these genomes along with 47 reference genomes representing eight validly published species revealed nine phylogenetic clades. Three of these clades were represented by a single species (B. toyonensis -clade V, B. weihenstephanensis - clade VI, B. cytotoxicus - VII), one by two dairy-associated isolates (clade II; representing a putative new species), one by two species (B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides - clade I) and four by three species (B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, B. anthracis - clades III-a, b, c and IV). Homologues of genes encoding a principal diarrheal enterotoxin (hemolysin BL) were distributed across all, except the B. cytotoxicus clade. Using a lateral flow immunoassay, hemolysin BL was detected in 13 out of 18 isolates that carried hblACD genes. Isolates from clade III-c (which included B. cereus and B. thuringiensis) consistently did not carry hblACD and did not produce hemolysin BL. Isolates from clade IV (B. cereus, B. thuringiensis) consistently carried hblACD and produced hemolysin BL. Compared to others, clade IV was significantly (p = 0.0001) more likely to produce this toxin. Isolates from clade VI (B. weihenstephanensis) carried hblACD homologues, but did not produce hemolysin BL, possibly due to amino acid substitutions in different toxin-encoding genes.",Is production of hemolysin BL by Bacillus cereus group isolates of dairy origin associated with whole-genome phylogenetic clade?,"Our results demonstrate that production of diarrheal enterotoxin hemolysin BL is neither inclusive nor exclusive to B. cereus sensu stricto, and that phylogenetic classification of isolates may be better than taxonomic identification for assessment of B. cereus group isolates risk for causing a diarrheal foodborne disease.",0,1.

"Chymase released by activated mast cells degrades high-density lipoproteins. We evaluated whether local activation of mast cells would attenuate cholesterol efflux from neighboring macrophage foam cells, thereby disrupting the entire in vivo pathway of macrophage-specific reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). C57Bl/6J mice received intraperitoneal injections of the mast cell-degranulating compound 48/80 to induce peritoneal mast cell activation, human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) to stimulate RCT, and [(3)H]cholesterol-labeled J774 macrophages for measurement of the rate of RCT. After 3 hours, (3)H-radioactivity was measured in the intestinal lumen contents. Activation of mast cells in the peritoneal cavity depleted human apoA-I pre-β-migrating species, impairing the ability of the peritoneal fluid to efficiently promote cholesterol efflux from cultured macrophages. Moreover, intact but not chymase-treated (proteolyzed) apoA-I accelerated the transfer of macrophage-derived (3)H- radioactivity to the intestinal contents. Importantly, stimulation of RCT by human apoA-I was fully blocked by 48/80 in mast cell-competent wild-type C57Bl/6J mice but not in mast cell-deficient W-sash c-kit mutant mice. The ability of intraperitoneally administered phospholipid vesicles to promote RCT in wild-type mice was not blocked by 48/80, supporting the notion that mast cell-dependent proteolysis of the intraperitoneally administered apoA-I was responsible for RCT inhibition.",Does mast cell activation in vivo impair the macrophage reverse cholesterol transport pathway in the mouse?,"Overall, our results suggest that tissue-specific activation of mast cells with ensuing release of chymase is able to proteolytically inactivate apoA-I in the microenvironment of the activated mast cells, thus locally impairing the initiation of macrophage RCT in vivo.",0,1.

"Although advanced-stage cervical cancer can benefit from current treatments, approximately 30% patients may fail after definitive treatment eventually. Therefore, exploring alternative molecular therapeutic approaches is imperatively needed for this disease. We have recently shown that activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic sensor, hampers cervical cancer cell growth through blocking the Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity. Here, we report that activated AMPK (p-AMPK) also inhibits cervical cancer cell growth by counteracting FOXM1 function. Effect of the activation of AMPK on FOXM1 expression was examined by hypoxia and glucose deprivation, as well as pharmacological AMPK activators such as A23187, AICAR and metformin. RT Q-PCR and Western blot analysis were employed to investigate the activities of AMPK, FOXM1 and AKT/FOXO3a signaling. Consistent with our previous findings, the activation of AMPK by either AMPK activators such as AICAR, A23187, metformin, glucose deprivation or hypoxia significantly inhibited the cervical cancer cell growth. Importantly, we found that activated AMPK activity was concomitantly associated with the reduction of both the mRNA and protein levels of FOXM1. Mechanistically, we showed that activated AMPK was able to reduce AKT mediated phosphorylation of p-FOXO3a (Ser253). Interestingly, activated AMPK could not cause any significant changes in FOXM1 in cervical cancer cells in which endogenous FOXO3a levels were knocked down using siRNAs, suggesting that FOXO3a is involved in the suppression of FOXM1.",Does activation of AMPK inhibit cervical cancer cell growth through AKT/FOXO3a/FOXM1 signaling cascade?,"Taken together, our results suggest the activated AMPK impedes cervical cancer cell growth through reducing the expression of FOXM1.",0,1.

"The aim of this study was to investigate whether the consecutive administration of recombinant thrombomodulin (r-TM) for 4 days improves maternal and fetal conditions and physiological outcomes in an N'-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester hydrochloride-induced and low-dose endotoxin-induced pre-eclampsia (PE). r-TM or saline was administrated i.v. to normal pregnant and experimental PE rats for 4 days. The maternal condition, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), fetal conditions, uteroplacental blood flow (UPBF), and oxygenation in the placenta and fetal brain was evaluated on gestational day 21. Significant increases in the mean arterial blood pressure, VEGFR-1 values and fetal death rate were observed in PE rats compared with control rats, while maternal and fetal bodyweight and fetal brain weight were substantially lower. Hypoperfusion and hypo-oxygenation in both the placenta and fetal brain tissues occurred in PE rats. Although r-TM failed to improve hypertension and affect the differences in maternal bodyweight between the groups, r-TM significantly improved hypoperfusion and fetal and maternal conditions, including VEGFR-1 values (6.5 ± 4.0 vs 2.2 ± 2.7 ng/mL, PE vs PE with r-TM, respectively; P < 0.05). Although not significant, a decrease in the fetal death rate was observed in PE rats administrated r-TM (36.1 ± 17.6% vs 25.0 ± 23.8%, P = 0.077).",Does thrombomodulin improve maternal and fetal conditions in an experimental pre-eclampsia rat model?,The severe reductions in the UPBF and the placental oxygenation imply that regional hypoperfusion occurs in association with systemic mean arterial pressure. r-TM may be a candidate medical treatment for PE complications.,0,1.

"To evaluate whether the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in the recipient cornea measured at the time of penetrating keratoplasty (PK) can act as a prognostic factor for corneal graft reaction development. The study included 25 eyes (of 25 patients) scheduled for PK. According to preoperative clinical finding, patients were divided into three groups: inflammatory with neovascularization (n = 11); inflammatory without neovascularization (n = 7); and non-inflammatory (n = 7). One half of the recipient cornea was analyzed for the levels of VEGF-A protein using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; the other half was analyzed to determine the loci of VEGF-A production by immunohistochemistry. The frequencies of corneal graft reaction and rejection were recorded, together with the improvement of visual acuity. Twenty-five donor corneas obtained from cadaver eyes represented the control group (n = 25). There was a statistically significant difference in the levels of VEGF-A protein between the recipient corneal buttons obtained from eyes with inflammatory changes and neovascularization, and those from the non-inflammatory group and controls (p < 0.01). The level of VEGF-A was 287.74 pg/ml (standard deviation [SD] = 129.181) in the inflammatory with corneal neovascularization group, 227.64 pg/ml (SD = 85.590) in the inflammatory without neovascularization group, 115.37 pg/ml (SD = 105.93) in the non-inflammatory group, and 142.28 pg/ml (SD = 93.081) in the control group. Graft reaction/rejection rate was 54.5%/45.5% in the inflammatory with neovascularization group, 14.3%/0% in the inflammatory without neovascularization group, and 14.3%/14.3% in non-inflammatory group. Patients who developed clinical signs of graft reaction during the postoperative follow-up had a significantly higher level of VEGF-A (307.4 pg/ml, SD = 100.058) compared with those without any signs of graft reaction (182.8 pg/ml, SD = 124.987).",Does vascular endothelial growth factor in a recipient cornea act as a prognostic factor for corneal graft reaction development?,Our results suggest that both graft reaction and final graft rejection occur more often in patients with increased levels of VEGF-A in a recipient cornea at the time of PK.,0,1.

"Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2)-specific inhibitors are marketed as safer analgesics than non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, there has been conflicting evidence concerning endothelial function and cardiovascular risk after COX-2 inhibitor use. We investigated forearm skin vascular reactivity to brief axillary artery occlusion in healthy volunteers after a single dose of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen (non-selective) and rofecoxib (COX-2 specific). Ten healthy male volunteers were studied. Forearm skin blood flow was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry. Two non-invasive probes were placed on the volar surface of the forearm. The magnitude of hyperaemic response to brief (20 s) and prolonged (5 min) occlusion of the axillary artery was measured before and 2-3 h after administration of ibuprofen 800 mg or rofecoxib 25 mg. The transient hyperaemic response ratio (THRR), defined as the net peak hyperaemic flow-flux divided by the net baseline flow-flux, was calculated. Each volunteer received both drugs in random order at least 1 week apart. Ibuprofen and rofecoxib increased net baseline blood flow (median (range): ibuprofen, from 23.3 (12.1-40.8) to 31.5 (17.4-77.3); rofecoxib, from 22.0 (14.6-41.0) to 29.9 (19.5-112.0); P<0.01). The net hyperaemic peak flow-flux after brief and prolonged occlusion was unchanged after both drugs. THRR was reduced by both drugs (ibuprofen, from 2.92 (2.38-3.86) to 2.09 (1.45-3.54); rofecoxib, from 3.36 (2.06-5.16) to 2.67 (1.15 -3.84); P<0.01).",Do non-selective and cyclo-oxygenase-2-specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs impair the hyperaemic response of skin to brief axillary artery occlusion?,"Both COX-2 and non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, when given to healthy volunteers as single therapeutic doses, decrease skin microvascular tone but do not impair maximal vasodilatory ability.",0,Do general and COX-2-specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications affect the skin's hyperemic reaction to temporary blockage of the axillary artery?,31.0,2443.0,2648.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.912520170211792,1.9027130603790283,4.883479356765747,"Yes, both non-selective (ibuprofen) and cyclo-oxygenase-2-specific (rofecoxib) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs impair the hyperaemic response of skin to brief axillary artery occlusion, as indicated by a reduction in the transient hyperaemic response ratio (THRR) after administration of both drugs.",0.4
"HSP90 is a cellular chaperone that is overexpressed in many cancers. HSP90 assists in proper folding of a variety of clients, many of which are oncoproteins. HSP90 has been shown to be elevated in endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer. Furthermore, HSP90 is known to stabilize the oncoprotein Akt; disruptions of the Akt pathway are common in gynecologic malignancies. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of HSP90 inhibitors in gynecologic cancer. We tested two HSP90 inhibitors, 17-AAG and 17-DMAG, against gynecologic cancer cell lines (four endometrial, one cervical, one ovarian, and one breast cancer line). We performed Western blots to determine effects of treatment on levels of HSP90 client proteins and PARP cleavage. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were used to assess cell viability, and flow cytometry to quantitate cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis. After treatment with 17-AAG or 17-DMAG, we detected no decrease in HSP90 levels. Levels of other oncoproteins did decrease with treatment: phosphorylated and total Akt, and Met. One cell line underwent G(1) arrest, and five showed G(2) arrest. All showed some level of apoptotic cell death, which was confirmed by detection of PARP cleavage. Sensitivity to the drugs varied among cell lines, ranging from 20% to 90% apoptosis after treatment.

"Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is a crucial step in initiating adaptive immune responses. In addition to recognizing endotoxin, TLR4 also recognizes endogenous ligands ('damage-associated structures'), which are released into the circulation in the peri-transplantation period. TLR2 to a lesser extent also recognizes these endogenous ligands. Multiple studies involving solid organ transplants demonstrate a clear association between TLR4 and allograft rejection. In the present study we assessed whether an association exists between TLR4 and TLR2-dependent responses and acute liver allograft rejection. The sample included 26 liver transplant recipients. Blood was taken pre-transplant and at multiple points over the first 14 days post-transplant. Monocytes were stimulated with TLR4 and TLR2 ligands, lipopolysaccharide and Pam-3-Cys, respectively. Monocyte TLR expression was determined using flow cytometry; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays measured tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production. Nine (34.6%) patients experienced rejection. No differences existed in age, sex, disease or immunosuppression between rejectors and non-rejectors. Baseline TLR4 expression was significantly higher in rejectors (1.36 vs 1.02, P=0.01). There was no difference in TLR2 expression. In rejectors, baseline TLR4- and TLR2-dependent production of TNF-α and IL-6 was also significantly increased. Post-transplant, the two groups differed with regard to TLR4-dependent TNF-α production, with rejectors demonstrating progressive downregulation over the first week.",Is acute allograft rejection in human liver transplant recipients associated with signaling through toll-like receptor 4?,"Prior to liver transplantation, patients who subsequently experience rejection demonstrate robust TLR4-dependent immune responses, which are not seen in those who do not reject.

"In some randomized studies, stentless aortic valves have demonstrated hemodynamic advantages in comparison with stented prostheses. The effect of more physiologic flow dynamics on coronary artery flow has not been investigated yet. This study compares coronary perfusion after aortic valve replacement with stented or stentless porcine bioprostheses in a prospective randomized study. A total of 24 patients (73 +/- 6 years) referred for treatment of aortic stenosis were randomized to aortic valve replacement with stented (Medtronic Mosaic; (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) or stentless (Medtronic Freestyle; Medtronic Inc) prostheses. Coronary flow was measured by means of magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively, 5 days after the operation, and 6 months postoperatively, then with evaluation of coronary flow reserve. Echocardiography was performed to quantify transvalvular gradients and left ventricular mass regression. Coronary flow increased in both groups significantly (P < .001) after aortic valve replacement. This increase was higher in the stentless group compared with that seen in the stented group (343 +/- 137 vs 221 +/- 66 mL/min). Also, coronary flow reserve was higher for stentless valves (3.4 +/- 0.3 for stentless valves and 2.3 +/- 0.1 for stented valves). Mean pressure gradients for Freestyle valves were lower (10 +/- 4 and 8 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively, vs 19 +/- 6 postoperatively and 15 +/- 4 mm Hg at follow-up for Mosaic valves, P < .05). Left ventricular mass regression was similar in both groups.",Do stentless bioprostheses improve postoperative coronary flow more than stented prostheses after valve replacement for aortic stenosis?,Normalization of coronary artery flow after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis was more pronounced for stentless valves compared with stented valves.

"Contrary to the extensive data accumulated regarding pancreatic carcinogenesis, the clinical and molecular features characteristic of advanced stage (stage III and IV) disease are unknown. A comprehensive study of pancreatic cancers from patients who have succumbed to their disease has the potential to greatly expand our understanding of the most lethal stage of this disease and identify novel areas for intervention. Rapid autopsies were performed on 76 patients with documented pancreatic cancer. The histologic features of end stage disease were determined and correlated to the stage at initial diagnosis, patterns of failure (locally destructive v metastatic disease) and the status of the KRAS2, TP53, and DPC4 genes. At autopsy, 30% of patients died with locally destructive pancreatic cancer, and 70% died with widespread metastatic disease. These divergent patterns of failure found at autopsy (locally destructive v metastatic) were unrelated to clinical stage at initial presentation, treatment history, or histopathologic features.

"Ethanol elicits strain-dependent blood pressure and baroreflex sensitivity responses in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats; the mechanisms underlying these divergent effects are not clear. The authors tested the hypothesis that differential neuronal actions of ethanol may account for these strain-dependent responses. To this end, the authors investigated the direct effects of ethanol on norepinephrine (NE)-containing neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), which modulate sympathetic neuronal activity, and on c-Jun-expressing neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), whose activity is inversely correlated with baroreflex sensitivity. In a newly developed model system in conscious, freely moving rats, the effect of intra-RVLM or intra-NTS ethanol was investigated on neuronal NE at the microinjection site (in vivo electrochemistry), blood pressure, heart rate, spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity, and c-Jun expression in the NTS. Ethanol (1, 5, or 10 microg) microinjection into the RVLM elicited dose-dependent increases in RVLM NE and blood pressure in SHRs but not in WKY rats.

"The outgrowth of new vessels--angiogenesis--in the tumour mass is considered to be a limiting factor of tumour growth. To inhibit the matrix lysis that is part of the tumour angiogenesis, we employed the chimeric protein mhATF-BPTI, composed of the receptor binding part of the urokinase (ATF) linked to an inhibitor of plasmin (BPTI). For delivery, recombinant adenovirus encoding the transgene of interest was injected intravenously or locally into the tumour. The anti tumour effect of this compound was compared to that of human endostatin and of mhATF alone in two different rat bronchial carcinomas growing either as subcutaneous implants or as metastases. Significant inhibition of the tumour growth and decrease of the number of lung metastasis was achieved when the concentration of mhATF-BPTI at the tumour site was above 400 of ng/g tissue. This concentration could be achieved via production by the liver, only if permissive to the recombinant adenovirus. When the tumour cells could be transduced, local delivery of the vector was enough to obtain a response. In the case of metastasis, the capacity of the lung tissue to concentrate the encoded protein was essential to reach the required therapeutic levels. Further, endostatin or mhATF could not reproduce the effects of mhATF-BPTI, at similar concentrations (mhATF) and even at 10-fold higher concentration (endostatin).",Does adenoviral gene transfer of angiostatic ATF-BPTI inhibit tumour growth?,"The ATF-BPTI was shown to inhibit tumour growth of different rat lung tumours when critical concentration was reached.

"Mounting evidence highlighting the benefits of hemostatic resuscitation has led to a renewed interest in whole blood (WB) and reconstituted WB (RWB). However, few data exist to characterize the clotting profiles of these variants. This study characterizes banked WB variants and RWB in standard 1:1:1 and 2:1:1 transfusion ratios of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets (PLTs). We hypothesized that the global hemostatic profile of 1:1:1 RWB is superior to 2:1:1 RWB and that PLT-modified WB (MWB) is superior to 1:1:1 RWB. Twenty-three units of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and PLTs were obtained from the regional blood collection center and mixed to create 23 1:1:1 and 23 2:1:1 RWB units. Freshly donated WB units were obtained and used to create 11 of each nonmodified WB (NMWB) (room temperature and cooled) and MWB (room temperature and cooled) variants. International normalized ratio (INR)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT), complete blood cell count, functional studies, and an extensive panel of procoagulant and anticoagulant factor assays were performed on all products. The 1:1:1 RWB had significantly lower INR and PTT (1.31 vs. 1.55, p = 0.0029; 42 seconds vs. 50 seconds, p = 0.0008) and higher activity of factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, and X; antithrombin III, as well as protein C and higher fibrinogen levels than did 2:1:1 RWB (factor IX, 86% vs. 70%, p = 0.0313; fibrinogen, 242 mg/dL vs. 202 mg/dL, p = 0.0385).

"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed in immune cells and hepatocytes. We examined whether hepatic Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is involved in the acute hepatic injury caused by the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (septic shock model). Wild type (WT), TLR4-deficient and chimera mice underwent myeloablative bone marrow transplantation to dissociate between TLR4 expression in the liver or in the immune-hematopoietic system. Mice were injected with LPS and sacrificed 4 hours later. Compared to TLR4 deficient mice, WT mice challenged with LPS displayed increased serum liver enzymes and hepatic cellular inflammatory infiltrate together with increased serum and hepatic levels of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) ,Up-regulation of hepatic mRNA encoding TLR4, IκB and c-jun expressions. TLR4 mutant mice transplanted with WT bone marrow were more protected than WT chimeric mice bearing TLR4 mutant hemopoietic cells from LPS, as seen by IL-1β and TNFα levels. We then used hepatocytes (Huh7) and macrophages from monocytic cell lines to detect TLR mRNA expression. Macrophages expressed a significantly higher level of TLR4 mRNA and TLR2 (more than 3000- and 8000-fold respectively) compared with the hepatocyte cell line.

"The histone deacetylase inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), enhances cisplatin [cis-diammine dichloroplatinum (II)] (CDDP)-induced apoptosis in the oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell line by complex, multifunctional mechanisms. We investigated the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the enhancing effect of SAHA on CDDP, compared with the ER stressor thapsigargin. We chose OSCC cell line HSC-3 to ascertain the mechanism of SAHA-enhanced cytotoxicity among various cell lines. HSC-3 cells were incubated with CDDP/SAHA for 48 h, followed by the assessment of cell chemosensitivity to CDDP with MTT and TUNEL assays. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expressions of ER-related molecules, and flow cytometry was used to monitor caspase activity. Treatment with CDDP/SAHA potently induced apoptosis in HSC-3 cells with a significant increase in caspase-4 and -12 functions. For example, 60% of cells became apoptotic after 48 h of treatment with CDDP/SAHA. In addition, SAHA alone rapidly induced sustained phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2 (eIF2)alpha, which is up-regulated during ER stress. Inhibition of ER stress by salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2alpha dephosphorylation, abrogated SAHA's enhancement of CDDP cytotoxicity. Levels of phospho-Akt are decreased in SAHA-treated cells, and this is in turn associated with increased activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) by SAHA, the phosphatase upstream of Akt.",Does enhancement of cisplatin cytotoxicity by SAHA involve endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells?,"These data indicate that up-regulation of specific-ER stress-associated events is an integral part of the mechanism by which SAHA enhances CDDP-induced apoptosis, and PP1 up-regulation followed by Akt dephosphorylation plays an important role in SAHA-enhanced CDDP apoptosis.",0,1.

"To establish whether cetuximab, a chimeric IgG1 antibody targeting epidermal growth factor receptor, has the potential to restore responsiveness to oxaliplatin in preclinical cancer models, as has been shown with irinotecan in irinotecan refractory metastatic colorectal cancer patients. The effects of cetuximab and oxaliplatin, alone or in combination, were tested in vitro and in vivo using human colorectal cancer cell lines selected for oxaliplatin resistance, as well as parental control cell lines. Evaluations were made of subcutaneous xenograft tumor growth in nu/nu athymic mice, as well as activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) and AKT, expression of DNA repair genes, density of apurinic/apyrimidinic DNA damage, and accumulation of platinum-DNA adducts in vitro. Oxaliplatin + cetuximab efficacy in murine subcutaneous xenograft models was greater than that of monotherapies and independent of the responsiveness to oxaliplatin monotherapy. In vitro, cetuximab reduced expression of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 and XPF, which are key components of the nucleotide excision repair pathway involved in the excision of platinum-DNA adducts. In addition, cetuximab reduced expression of XRCC1, a component of the base excision repair pathway responsible for the repair of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites. Effects of cetuximab on DNA repair protein levels were downstream to effects on mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT pathway activation. In line with effects on DNA repair protein expression, cetuximab increased the accumulation of platinum and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites on DNA during oxaliplatin treatment.",Do tumors established with cell lines selected for oxaliplatin resistance respond to oxaliplatin if combined with cetuximab?,Cetuximab has the potential to salvage the benefits of oxaliplatin in oxaliplatin-resistant colorectal cancer patients by reducing DNA repair capacity.,0,1.

"Inflammation promotes acute coronary syndromes and ensuing clinical complications. Although statins reduce inflammatory markers in asymptomatic adults or in patients with stable angina, the effect of statins on the markedly heightened inflammation in patients with acute coronary syndromes is unknown. We measured C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in 2402 subjects enrolled the Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) study. Subjects with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction were randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg/d or placebo within 24 to 96 hours of hospital admission and treated for 16 weeks. The effect of treatment on inflammatory markers was assessed by ANCOVA after adjustment for presenting syndrome, country, and initial level of marker. All 3 markers were markedly elevated at randomization and declined over the 16 weeks in both treatment groups.

"Gut microbiota may be associated with the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This study aimed to investigate the protective effects and possible mechanisms of Lactobacillus paracasei on NASH. Thirty male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into three groups and maintained for 10 weeks: control group (standard chow), NASH model group (high fat + 10 % fructose diet), and the L. paracasei group (NASH model with L. paracasei). Liver histology, serum aminotransferase levels, and hepatic gene expression levels were measured. Intestinal permeability was investigated using urinary (51)Creatinine Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ((51)Cr-EDTA) clearance. Total Kupffer cell counts and their composition (M1 vs. M2 Kupffer cells) were measured using flow cytometry with F4/80 and CD206 antibodies. Hepatic fat deposition, serum ALT level, and (51)Cr-EDTA clearance were significantly lower in the L. paracasei group than the NASH group (p < 0.05).

"Tumor necrosis factor-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) gene has been shown important in cardiac remodeling. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the variants of TNFAIP3 gene are associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients. Four representatives of all the other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNFAIP3 gene were tested for association with hypertrophy in two independent hypertensive populations (n = 2120 and n = 324). We found that only the tag SNP (rs5029939) was consistently lower in the hypertensives with cardiac hypertrophy than in those without cardiac hypertrophy in the two study populations, indicating a protective effect on LVH (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) 0.58 (0.358 - 0.863), P = 0.035; OR (95%CI) = 0.477 (0.225 - 0.815), P < 0.05, respectively).

"Resistin could be the linkage between the adipose tissue and the insulin resistance. In humans, the role of resistin on metabolic and vascular homeostasis is not well defined. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible association between resistin expression and insulin resistance. We evaluated the relationship between monocyte expression of mRNA and anthropometric and metabolic parameters of insulin resistance. We focused on the potential role of resistin on endothelial function. Thirty-nine patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) and clinically free from cardiovascular disease, and 15 healthy subjects were included in this study. All subjects underwent clinical examination, assessment of haematochemical parameters, bioimpedentiometry, measurement of monocyte resistin mRNA and of brachial-artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMV). Patients with MS showed higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL; 2.1 +/- 1.2 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.9 pg/mL, P < 0.05) and reduced FMV (5.4 +/- 3.9 vs. 8.3 +/- 3.1%, P < 0.05).

"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a novel member of the tumor necrosis factor family, induces apoptosis in TRAIL-sensitive tumors through the activation of the caspase pathway. Sodium butyrate (NaBT) induces differentiation and apoptosis in certain colorectal cancers; the molecular mechanisms for these effects have not been clearly defined. The purpose of our study was to determine whether NaBT sensitizes TRAIL-resistant human colon cancer cells to the effects of TRAIL.

The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of apoptotic cell clearance, and whether inflammation, organ injury, and survival are improved after treatment with recombinant human MFG-E8 (rhMFG-E8) after hemorrhagic shock. Male mice underwent a pressure-controlled (25 mm Hg ± 5 mm Hg) model of hemorrhagic shock for 90 minutes. They were resuscitated with normal saline with or without recombinant human MFG-E8 (rhMFG-E8) over 30 minutes. At 3.5-hour postresuscitation, blood and tissue were collected. MFG-E8 levels in the plasma, lungs, and spleen were measured. Apoptotic cell clearance was measured by cleaved caspase-3 levels and TUNEL staining. Neutrophil infiltration was assessed using myeloperoxidase activity in the lungs and spleen. Plasma and tissue levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) were measured by ELISA.

"Interleukin-11 (IL-11), an IL-6-type cytokine, is thought to be involved in bone resorption via osteoclast differentiation. Here, we characterized the combined effect of IL-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), major cytokines in the rheumatoid synovium, on the production of IL-11 by cultured rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts (RSFs). The amounts of IL-11, IL-6, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-11 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were determined by Northern blotting. Protein expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms were determined by Western blotting. IL-1alpha and TNFalpha synergistically stimulated RSFs to produce IL-11 at both the mRNA and protein levels. This synergistic effect was completely inhibited by indomethacin. The inhibition was prevented by PGE2, indicating that the synergistic effect of IL-1alpha and TNFalpha was PGE2-mediated. The cooperative effects of these 2 cytokines were also observed in the production of PGE2 and the expression of 2 regulatory enzymes in PGE2 production, cPLA2 and COX-2. The synergistic induction of IL-11 by IL-1alpha and TNFalpha was completely inhibited by a potent inhibitor of all isoforms of PKC, GF109203X.

"CaBP-9k may be involved in the active calcium absorption and embryo implantation. Although we generated CaBP-9k KO mice to explore its function, no distinct phenotypes were observed in these KO mice. It can be hypothesized that TRPV5 and 6 and plasma membrane calcium ATPase 1b may play a role in the regulation of calcium transport to compensate CaBP-9k deficiency in its KO model. Active calcium transport in the duodenum and kidney is carried in three steps: calcium entry through epithelial Ca2+ channels (TRPV5 and TRPV6), buffering and/or transport by calbindin-D9k (CaBP-9k) and -D28k (CaBP-28k), and extrusion through the plasma membrane calcium ATPase 1b (PMCA1b) and sodium/calcium exchanger 1. Although the molecular mechanism of calcium absorption has been studied using knockouts (KOs) of the vitamin D receptor and CaBP-28k in animals, the process is not fully understood. We generated CaBP-9k KO mice and assessed the phenotypic characterization and the molecular regulation of active calcium transporting genes when the mice were fed different calcium diets during growth. General phenotypes showed no distinct abnormalities. Thus, the active calcium transport of CaBP-9k-null mice proceeded normally in this study. Therefore, the compensatory molecular regulation of this mechanism was elucidated. Duodenal TRPV6 and CaBP-9k mRNA of wildtype (WT) mice increased gradually during preweaning.

"Many people seek medical attention for skin lesions and other conditions they attribute to spider bites. Prior experience suggests that many of these lesions have alternate causes, especially infections with community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). This study determined the percentage of emergency department (ED) patients reporting a ""spider bite"" who received a clinical diagnosis of spider bite by their physician vs. other etiologies, and if the diagnoses correlated with demographic risk factors for developing CA-MRSA infections. ED patients who reported that their condition was caused by a ""spider bite"" were prospectively enrolled in an anonymous, voluntary survey regarding details of their illness and demographic information. Discharge diagnoses were also collected and categorized as: spider bite, bite from other animal (including unknown arthropod), infection, or other diagnosis. There were 182 patients enrolled over 23 months. Seven patients (3.8%) were diagnosed with actual spider bites, 9 patients (4.9%) with bites from other animals, 156 patients (85.7%) with infections, and 6 patients (3.3%) were given other diagnoses. Four patients were given concurrent diagnoses in two categories, and 8 (4.4%) did not have the diagnosis recorded on the data collection instrument.

"Considering that grafted gingival tissue might have to be adapted to the receptor area and that fibroblasts have the ability to respond to bacterial stimuli through the release of various cytokines, this study investigated whether fibroblasts from the palatal mucosa behave differently when grafted onto the gingival margin regarding cytokine secretion. Biopsies from the palatal mucosa were collected at the time of free gingival graft surgery, and after four months re-collection was performed upon surgery for root coverage. Fibroblasts were isolated by the explant technique, cultured and stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Escherichia coli (Ec) LPS for 24 or 48 h for comparative evaluation of the secretion of cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, MIP-1α/CCL3, TGF-β, VEGF and CXCL16. Unstimulated cells were used as the control group. Cells were tested for viability through MTT assay, and secretion of cytokines and chemokines was evaluated in the cell supernatants by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Fibroblasts from the palatal mucosa maintained the same secretion pattern of IL-6 when grafted onto the gingival margin. On the contrary, fibroblasts from the marginal gingival graft showed increased secretion of IL-8/CXCL8 even in the absence of stimulation. Interestingly, MIP-1α/CCL3 secretion by fibroblasts from the marginal gingival graft was significantly increased after 48 hours of stimulation with Pg LPS and after 24 h with Ec LPS. Only fibroblasts from the marginal gingival graft showed secretion of TGF-β. VEGF and CXCL16 secretion were not detected by both subsets of fibroblasts.",Do palatal mucosa derived fibroblasts present an adaptive behavior regarding cytokine secretion when grafted onto the gingival margin?,Fibroblasts from the palatal mucosa seem to be adapted to local conditions of the site microenvironment when grafted onto the gingival marginal area.

"Posttraumatic lung contusion is common after blunt chest trauma, and patients often need ventilatory support. Lung contusion induces an inflammatory response signified by primed polymorph neutrophil granulocytes (PMNs) in blood and tissue. Mechanical ventilation (MV) can also cause an inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to develop an animal model to investigate the effect of high-volume ventilation on the inflammatory response in blunt chest trauma. We assigned 23 male Sprague-Dawley rats to either MV or bilateral lung contusion followed by MV. We used three extra rats as controls. Lung contusion was induced by a blast generator, a device releasing a single pressure blast wave centered on the chest. We determined tissue and systemic inflammation by absolute PMN numbers in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), myeloperoxidase, interleukin (IL)-6, IL 1β, growth-related oncogene-KC, and IL-10 in both plasma and BALF. Survival after blunt chest trauma was correlated to the distance to the blast generator. Compared with controls, both MV and blast plus MV rats showed increased systemic and pulmonary inflammation, expressed by higher PMNs, myeloperoxidase levels, and cytokine levels in both blood and BALF. Blast plus MV rats showed a higher systemic and pulmonary inflammatory response than MV rats.",Does mechanical ventilation increase the inflammatory response induced by lung contusion?,"The blast generator generated reproducible blunt chest trauma in rats.

"Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are lethal diseases in humans, and the current treatments have limited therapeutic effects. Cordyceps militaris (CM) is a caterpillar-grown traditional medicinal mushroom, and has been used as a natural invigorant for longevity, endurance, and vitality in China. Recently, purified extracts from CM have been shown to have beneficial effects on various diseases including cancer. Nevertheless, a role of CM in ALI has not been examined previously. Here, we used a bleomycin-induced ALI model to study the effects of CM on the severity of ALI in mice. The levels of CXCR2, a receptor for Interleukin 8 (IL-8) in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, were examined in different experimental groups. The levels of microRNA (miR)-1321 and miR-3188 were also examined in lung samples and in CM. Adeno-associated viruses carrying miR-1321 and miR-3188 were injected into bleomycin-treated mice for evaluation their effects on the severity of ALI. CM treatment significantly alleviated the severity of bleomycin-induced ALI in mice. The increases in lung CXCR2 by bleomycin were significantly reduced by CM at protein level, but not at mRNA level. CM contained high levels of 2 miRNAs (miR-1321 and miR-3188) that target 3'-UTR of CXCR2 mRNA to inhibit its expression. Overexpression of miR-1321 and miR-3188 in mouse lung through AAV-mediated gene therapy mimicked the effects of CM.",Does cordyceps Militaris alleviate Severity of Murine Acute Lung Injury Through miRNAs-Mediated CXCR2 Inhibition?,CM may alleviate severity of murine ALI through miRNAs-mediated CXCR2 inhibition.,0,1.

"This study was conducted to identify the safety of endovascular procedures in the office endovascular suite and to assess patient satisfaction in this setting. Between May 22, 2007, and December 31, 2012, 2822 patients underwent 6458 percutaneous procedures in an office-based endovascular suite. Demographics of the patients, complications, hospital transfers, and 30-day mortality were documented in a prospective manner. Follow-up calls were made, and a satisfaction survey was conducted. Almost all dialysis procedures were done under local anesthesia and peripheral arterial procedures under conscious sedation. All patients, except those undergoing catheter removals, received hydrocodone and acetaminophen (5/325 mg), diazepam (5-10 mg), and one dose of an oral antibiotic preprocedure and three doses postprocedure. Patients who required conscious sedation received fentanyl and midazolam. Conscious sedation was used almost exclusively in patients having an arterial procedure. Measurements of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, international normalized ratio, and partial thromboplastin time were performed before peripheral arteriograms. All other patients had no preoperative laboratory tests. Patients considered high risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification 4), those who could not tolerate the procedure with mild to moderate conscious sedation, patients with a previous bad experience, or patients who weighed >400 pounds were not candidates for office based procedures. There were 54 total complications (0.8%): venous, 2.2%; aortogram without interventions, 1%; aortogram with interventions, 2.7%; fistulogram, 0.5%; catheters, 0.3%; and venous filter-related, 2%. Twenty-six patients required hospital transfer from the office. Ten patients needed an operative intervention because of a complication. No procedure-related deaths occurred.

"During storage, the activity of the red blood cell (RBC) antioxidant system decreases. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is essential for protection against oxidative stress by producing NADPH. G6PD function of RBC transfusion products is reported to remain stable during storage, but activity was measured in hemolysates and not in individual RBCs. We hypothesized that analysis of G6PD activity in individual RBC identifies storage-dependent changes in G6PD function. Seven units of stored leukoreduced RBCs, stored in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol, were sampled every week up to 6 weeks of storage. G6PD activity was determined with the cytofluorometric method and expressed as mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) per RBC. During storage, G6PD activity decreased significantly. Mean MFI after 3 days of storage was 27.8 ± 8.8 and gradually decreased significantly to 18.0 ± 8.3 after 42 days.",Does glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity decrease during storage of leukoreduced red blood cells?,G6PD activity decreases during storage of leukoreduced RBCs.

"Although the effect of preoperative biliary drainage in patients with obstructive jaundice is controversial, bacterial or endotoxin translocation is one of the main postoperative problem in jaundiced patients. Failure in gut barrier functions causes bacterial translocation; homing and distribution of T lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria are important for gut mucosal immune defense. This study was performed to examine whether bile regulates the numbers of T lymphocyte subsets or the expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) in experimental jaundice in rats with and without external and internal biliary drainage. Four groups of Wistar rats were used: those that received a sham operation (SHAM), common bile duct ligation (CBDL), CBDL followed by external drainage (ED), and CBDL followed by internal drainage (ID). Numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes and MAdCAM-1-positive cells in the lamina propria were counted immunohistochemically in the specimens of jejunum and ileum of each group. Bacterial translocation was examined by culturing from the mesenteric lymph node complex isolated from rats in each group. A significant decrease in numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes and MAdCAM-1-positive cells in the lamina propria was seen in obstructive jaundice, although numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes increased in comparison with the sham-operated control. The numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes and MAdCAM-1 expression in the lamina propria did not recover to a normal level after external drainage, but did so after internal drainage. Frequencies of bacterial translocation were high in the CBDL and ED group. In contrast, bacterial translocation was not present in any animals in the SHAM group and was at a low percentage in the ID group.",Does internal biliary drainage improve decreased number of gut mucosal T lymphocytes and MAdCAM-1 expression in jaundiced rats?,Changes in the number of T lymphocytes and MAdCAM-1 expression are associated with the presence of bile in the gastrointestinal tract and are inversely correlated with the frequency of bacterial translocation induced by CBD ligation.

"Adjuvant chemotherapy after the resection of stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is now the standard of care based on large-scale phase III trials and a meta-analysis. However, chemotherapy has plateaued in terms of its efficacy, and the search for treatment prediction biomarkers is imperative for the further identification of treatable subgroups. Therefore, we investigated the significance of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) expression and the applicability of a Cox-2 inhibitor in patients who had received adjuvant chemotherapy. We conducted a retrospective review of data from 97 patients who had received adjuvant chemotherapy. The adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of an oral tegafur agent (OT) or platinum-based chemotherapy (PB). The criteria for regimen selection were based on a discussion among the cancer board and enrollment in a clinical trial. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) for Cox-2 was performed, and the correlation between Cox-2 expression and disease-free survival (DFS) was evaluated. IHC showed that 56 cases (57.7%) were positive for Cox-2. The rate of Cox-2 expression was similar for the PB and OT groups. Among the patients who received PB, the DFS of the patients with Cox-2 expression was significantly poorer than that of the patients without Cox-2 expression (P = 0.017), but there was no significant difference among the patients who received OT (P = 0.617).

Levels of uPA and its inhibitor PAI-1 were prospectively measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in primary tumor tissue extracts. HER2 gene amplification (HER2_AMP) was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; Ventana Medical Systems HER-2/neu probe; Tucson, AZ), and HER2 protein overexpression (HER2_EXP) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC; Oncogene Science antibody Ab-3; Cambridge, MA) on parallel-cut formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. uPA/PAI-1 was high (either one or both factors were high) in 44% of the tumors.

"Inflammatory markers are increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are hypothesised to play an important part in muscle dysfunction and exercise intolerance. The Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) study is a prospective observational cohort of well functioning individuals aged 70-79 years. A cross sectional analysis of the baseline data was conducted to examine the association between inflammatory markers and ventilatory limitation, muscle strength, and exercise capacity. These associations were compared in participants with and without obstructive lung disease (OLD). Of the 3075 participants enrolled in the Health ABC cohort, OLD was identified by spirometric testing in 268 participants and 2005 participants had normal spirometric results. Of the participants with OLD, 35%, 38%, and 27% participants had mild, moderate, and severe OLD, respectively. Participants with OLD had lower quadriceps strength (102.5 Nm v 108.9 Nm, p = 0.02), lower maximum inspiratory pressure (64.7 cm H(2)O v 74.2 cm H(2)O, p<0.0001), higher systemic interleukin (IL)-6 levels (2.6 pg/ml v 2.2 pg/ml, p<0.0001), and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (3.5 mg/l v 2.5 mg/l, p<0.0001) than those with normal spirometry.

"In the rat, two forms of the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, PSTI-I and PSTI-II, are secreted into pancreatic juice. It is assumed that their role is to protect the pancreas from premature activation of the protease-rich pancreatic juice. In the small intestine, PSTI-I, also called 'monitor peptide', is thought to have a different role: PSTI-I competes with protein for activated trypsin. In the presence of a protein-rich meal, free PSTI induces a release of cholecystokinine from the intestine. To investigate whether its role as monitor peptide is compatible with the inhibitory, protective function in the pancreas, PSTI-I was chemically synthesized and then renatured. The peptide was almost completely trypsin resistant and exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory activity to bovine and partially purified rat trypsin. Furthermore, experiments with trypsin- and endopeptidase-activated pancreatic juice demonstrated that its inhibitory capacity was sufficient to prevent premature activation.

"To evaluate the effect of sibutramine on weight loss, insulin sensitivity and serum adiponectin levels in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel comparison study of sibutramine 15 mg/day and placebo. Forty-eight eligible obese patients with Type 2 diabetes (age between 30 and 75 years with body mass index > or = 27 kg/m(2)) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 24) or sibutramine (15 mg/day) (n = 24) for 6 months. Fifteen subjects in each group underwent meal tests and modified insulin suppression tests before and after 6 months' treatment. After 6 months of sibutramine treatment statistically significant changes from baseline were observed for body weight (85.4 +/- 2.5 vs. 82.9 +/- 2.4 kg, P < 0.005) and body mass index (32.0 +/- 0.7 vs. 31.4 +/- 0.6 kg/m(2), P < 0.05) without a significant alteration of waist-hip ratio (W/H), blood pressure, heart rate, glycaemic parameters or lipid profiles. The steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) level during the modified insulin suppression test was significantly reduced in the sibutramine group (17.33 +/- 2.92 vs. 14.29 +/- 4.19 mmol/l, P < 0.05) despite similar steady-state plasma insulin (SSPI) concentrations. In addition, serum adiponectin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels remained unchanged, although modest weight reduction was achieved after sibutramine treatment.

"Heart function declines with age, but the genetic factors underlying such deterioration are largely unknown. Wnt signaling is known to play a role in heart development, but it has not been shown to be important in adult heart function. We have investigated the nuclear adapter protein encoded by pygopus (pygo), which mediates canonical Wnt signaling, for roles in aging-related cardiac dysfunction. Using the Drosophila heart model, we show that cardiac-specific pygo knockdown in adult flies causes a significant (4- to 5-fold) increase in cardiac arrhythmias (P<0.001) that worsened with age and caused a significant decrease in contractility (-54%; P<0.001) with systolic dysfunction. Immunohistochemistry revealed structural abnormalities that worsened with age, and both functional and morphological alterations were ameliorated by pygo overexpression. Unexpectedly, knockdown of 2 other Wnt signaling components, β-cat/armadillo or TCF/pangolin, had relatively milder effects on cardiac function. Double-heterozygous combinations of mutants for pygo and canonical Wnt signaling components had no additional effect on heart function over pygo heterozygotes alone. However, double knockdown of pygo and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II caused additional arrhythmia compared with pygo knockdown alone, suggesting that some of the effects of pygo are mediated by Ca2+ signaling. In the isoproterenol-induced hypertrophic mouse model, we show that Pygo1 protein levels are increased.",Does pygopus maintain heart function in aging Drosophila independently of canonical Wnt signaling?,Our data indicate that Pygo plays a critical role in adult heart function that is Wnt signaling independent and is likely conserved in mammals.,0,1.

"To evaluate the risk of childhood hospitalization associated with infant feeding patterns at 6-8 weeks of age in Scotland. A retrospective population level study based on the linkage of birth, death, maternity, infant health, child health surveillance, and admission records for children born as single births in Scotland between 1997 and 2009 (n = 502 948) followed up to March 2012. Descriptive analyses, Kaplan Meier tests, and Cox regression were used to quantify the association between the mode of infant feeding and risk of childhood hospitalization for respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract infections, and other common childhood ailments during the study period. Within the first 6 months of life, there was a greater hazard ratio (HR) of hospitalization for common childhood illnesses among formula-fed infants (HR 1.40; 95% CI 1.35-1.45) and mixed-fed infants (HR 1.18; 95% CI 1.11-1.25) compared with infants exclusively breastfed after adjustment for parental, maternal, and infant health characteristics.

A characteristic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in each of 9 genetic factors, ITGAM (rs1143679), C8orf13-BLK (rs13277113), TYK2 (rs2304256), 1q25.1 (rs10798269), PXK (rs6445975), KIAA1542 (rs4963128), MECP2 (rs17435), BANK1 (rs17266594), and LY9 (rs509749), was studied in 1,635 patients with RA and 1,906 control subjects from Spain. The rs7574865 SNP in STAT4 was also included. Analyses were conducted globally and after stratification by sex and clinical features (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide and rheumatoid factor, shared epitope, rheumatoid nodules, radiographic changes, sicca syndrome, and pneumonitis). No association was observed between RA and any of the 9 newly identified SLE genetic factors. A meta-analysis using previous data was consistent with these results. In addition, there were no significant differences between individuals with and those without each of the clinical features analyzed, except the frequency of the minor allele in the C8orf13-BLK locus that was decreased in patients with sicca syndrome (14.6% versus 22.4% in controls; P = 0.003).",Does rheumatoid arthritis share most of the newly identified systemic lupus erythematosus genetic factors?,"None of the 9 recently identified SLE risk factors showed association with RA.

"p-Cresyl sulphate (p-CS) and p-cresyl glucuronide (p-CG) are uraemic toxins that exhibit pro-inflammatory features in leukocytes and are associated with the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Tubular cells are key targets of nephrotoxic agents and tubular cell death and activation contribute to the progression of CKD. However, the potential toxicity of these compounds on tubular cells is not fully understood. More specifically, apoptosis has never been studied. HK-2 human proximal tubular epithelial cells were studied. Cell death was evaluated by flow cytometry of DNA content and by morphology. Gene expression was studied by real-time (RT)-PCR. Protein expression was studied by western blot and flow cytometry. Long-term (7 days) exposure to p-CS induced apoptosis in HK-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, short-term (3 h) exposure to p-CS promoted the expression of the TWEAK receptor Fn14, cooperated with TWEAK in promoting cell death and increased inflammatory gene expression.

"To investigate cortisol levels in brain dysfunction in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. In 128 septic and sedated patients, we studied brain dysfunction including delirium and coma by the evaluation of Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), the Confusion Method Assessment in the ICU (CAM-ICU) after sedation withdrawal and the measurement of serum S100B biomarker of brain injury. Serum cortisol and S100B were measured within 12 hours after ICU admission and daily over the next four days. Brain dysfunction was observed in 50% (64/128) before but in 84% (107/128) of patients after sedation withdrawal, and was more common in the patients older than 57 years (P = 0.009).

"Aberrant activation of tyrosine kinase receptors is frequently observed in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Moreover, activating mutations of the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor can be found in approximately 30% of patients, thereby representing one of the most frequent single genetic alterations in AML. AEE788, a novel dual receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is being studied in several solid tumors with remarkable success. It is not known, however, about the efficacy of this inhibitor in the treatment of AML. Therefore, we investigated the effect of AEE788 in the treatment of three human AML cell lines and seven AML patient samples. Cell survival in THP-1, MOLM-13, and MV4-11 cell lines (the two last harboring the FLT3/internal tandem duplication mutation) and AML blasts incubated with 0.5 to 15 microM AEE788 were quantified.

"Astrocytes have critical roles in the human CNS in health and disease. They provide trophic support to neurons and are innate-immune cells with keys roles during states-of-inflammation.

Responses were compared to a variety of inflammatory cytokines known to be released in the CNS during neuroinflammation. Astrocyte compromise measured by xCELLigence was confirmed using ATP measurements, cleaved caspase 3 expression, assessment of nuclear morphology and cell death. Inflammatory activation (IL-1β or TNFα) of astrocytes results in the transient production of key inflammatory mediators including IL-6, cell surface adhesion molecules, and various leukocyte chemoattractants. Following this phase, the NT2-astrocytes progressively become compromised, which is indicated by a loss of adhesion, appearance of apoptotic nuclei and reduction in ATP levels, followed by DEATH.

The role of intragraft TNF receptor (TNFR) signaling in activation of gene expression in allografts has not been studied. Gene expression profiling and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to investigate the role of TNFR signaling in the early intragraft activation of cellular gene expression in renal allografts at 2 days posttransplant. The TNFRs play a critical role in activating intragraft expression of transcription factors controlling innate and adaptive immunity and stress responses (interferon regulatory factor [IRF]1, IRF 8, Isgf3g, and ATF3) of cytokines and receptors mediating inflammation (TNF, interleukin [IL]-6, interferon-gamma, oncostatin M receptor [OMCR], toll-like receptor [TLR]2, and IL-2Rgamma), of chemokines and adhesion molecules that recruit inflammatory cells (Cxcl9, Cxcl11, E-selectin, and intracellular adhesion molecule [ICAM]-1), of genes involved in costimulation of T cells and processing and presentation of antigens (H2-DMb, Psmb8, and CD40), and genes that mediate the response to interferons. In addition to its proinflammatory role, TNFR signaling induces expression of SOCS3, a negative regulator of IL-6 and OSMR signaling and Nfkbie, and a negative regulator of TNFR signal transduction.",Does intragraft TNF receptor signaling contribute to activation of innate and adaptive immunity in a renal allograft model?,These studies illustrate the pleiotropic effect of TNF in both activation and down-modulation of the immune response and the complex interactions between the TNFRs and other cytokine signaling pathways in the early allograft response.,0,1.

"The ability of epithelial cells (ECs) to discriminate between commensal and pathogenic microbes is essential for healthy living. Key to these interactions are mucosal epithelial responses to pathogen-induced damage. Using reconstituted oral epithelium, we assessed epithelial gene transcriptional responses to Candida albicans infection by microarray. Signal pathway activation was monitored by Western blotting and transcription factor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the role of these pathways in C. albicans-induced damage protection was determined using chemical inhibitors. Transcript profiling demonstrated early upregulation of epithelial genes involved in immune responses. Many of these genes constituted components of signaling pathways, but only NF-κB, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt pathways were functionally activated. We demonstrate that PI3K/Akt signaling is independent of NF-κB and MAPK signaling and plays a key role in epithelial immune activation and damage protection via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation.",Is protection against epithelial damage during Candida albicans infection mediated by PI3K/Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling?,PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling may play a critical role in protecting epithelial cells from damage during mucosal fungal infections independent of NF-κB or MAPK signaling.,0,Is the defense against epithelial injury during Candida albicans infection regulated by PI3K/Akt and mTOR signaling pathways?,24.0,2458.0,2616.0,1.0,0.5,0.6309297535714575,1.7419095039367676,1.5275840759277344,4.24738359451294,"Yes, protection against epithelial damage during Candida albicans infection is mediated by PI3K/Akt signaling and involves the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).",0.9
"To evaluate whether subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation has an effect on the orthostatic regulation of patients with Parkinson disease (PD), we studied cardiovascular regulation during on and off phases of STN stimulation. We examined 14 patients with PD (mean age 58.1 +/- 5.8 years, 4 women, 10 men) with bilateral STN stimulators. Patients underwent 3 minutes of head-up tilt (HUT) testing during STN stimulation and after 90 minutes interruption of stimulation. We monitored arterial blood pressure (BP), RR intervals (RRI), respiration, and skin blood flow (SBF). Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was assessed as the square root of the ratio of low-frequency power of RRI to the low-frequency power of systolic BP for coherences above 0.5. During the on phase of the STN stimulation, HUT induced no BP decrease, a significant tachycardia, and a significant decrease of SBF. During the off phase of stimulation, HUT resulted in significant decreases in BPsys and RRI and only a slight SBF decrease. HUT induced no change of BRS during stimulation, but lowered BRS when the stimulator was off (p < 0.05).",Does deep brain stimulation improve orthostatic regulation of patients with Parkinson disease?,"STN stimulation of patients with PD increases peripheral vasoconstriction and BRS and stabilizes BP, thereby improving postural hypotension in patients with PD.

"In the coronary and the forearm circulations, endothelium-dependent vasomotion is impaired in smokers, but can be augmented by -arginine or vitamin C. We examined whether smoking similarly affects the renal circulation. In 20 smokers (age 26 +/- 4 years) and in 20 non-smokers (age 28 +/- 3 years) changes of renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood pressure and heart rate in response to the subsequent intravenous infusions of N(G)-monomethyl--arginine (L-NMMA), -arginine and -arginine plus vitamin C were studied by use of a constant infusion input clearance technique. Systemic haemodynamic parameters did not differ between smokers and non-smokers during each experimental phase. At baseline, RPF and GFR were similar between the groups. The infusion of L-NMMA led to a similar decrease of RPF, while GFR did not change in either group. During the infusion of -arginine RPF increased similarly. Finally, the co-infusion of -arginine plus vitamin C led to a significantly greater increase of RPF (+277 +/- 395 vs +79 +/- 76 ml/min, P = 0.03) and GFR (+12.1 +/- 10.6 vs +3.4 +/- 11.2 ml/min, P = 0.02) in smokers as compared to non-smokers.",Does vitamin C augment the renal response to L-arginine in smokers?,L-NMMA-induced vasoconstriction of the renal vasculature was similar in smokers compared to non-smokers. -arginine alone induced a similar increase of RPF.

"FRAP-p70s6K signaling regulates mitogenic responses to growth factors in eukaryotic cells. Constitutive p70s6K activation occurs in some human malignancies and may contribute to dysregulated cell growth. We examined whether inhibition of this pathway affects mitogen-induced proliferation and cell cycle progression of human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Quiescent BxPC3 and Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells treated with or without 20 ng/mL rapamycin (FRAP inhibitor) were repleted with 10% FCS to induce cell cycle entry. Proliferation was measured with MTT assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by FACS analysis. Phosphorylation of p70s6K, Akt, and cdc2 was evaluated by Western blot. Statistical analysis was by two-tailed t test (P < 0.05). Rapamycin (Rapa) inhibited the phosphorylation of p70s6K while inducing G(1) cell cycle arrest (P < 0.005). In both cell lines, Rapa inhibited serum-induced proliferation (P < 0.05) without affecting apoptosis. Cdc2 phosphorylation was inhibited by 15 min with Rapa (not shown), consistent with cell cycle arrest. Akt phosphorylation was not affected, indicating FRAP specificity of Rapa.",Is fRAP-p70s6K signaling required for pancreatic cancer cell proliferation?,"FRAP-p70s6K signaling appears to be necessary for G(1)-to-S phase progression and proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells.

"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase aberrantly expressed in cancer, but its clinical and functional importance remain controversial. Mutation or amplification of ALK, as well as its expression levels assessed by conventional immunohistochemistry methods, has been linked to prognosis in cancer, although with potential bias because of the semi-quantitative approaches. Herein, we measured ALK mRNA expression in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and determined its clinical impact on patients' stratification and outcome. Specimens were obtained from RMS patients and cell lines, and ALK expression was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting, IHC, and copy number analysis. High ALK mRNA expression was detected in the vast majority of PAX3/7-FOXO1-positive tumours, whereas PAX3/7-FOXO1-negative RMS displayed considerably lower amounts of both mRNA and protein. Notably, ALK mRNA distinguished unfavourable PAX3/7-FOXO1-positive tumours from PAX3/7-FOXO1-negative RMS (P<0.0001), and also correlated with larger tumour size (P<0.05) and advanced clinical stage (P<0.01), independently of fusion gene status. High ALK mRNA levels were of prognostic relevance by Cox univariate regression analysis and correlated with increased risk of relapse (P=0.001) and survival (P=0.01), whereas by multivariate analysis elevated ALK mRNA expression resulted a negative prognostic marker when clinical stage was not included.",Does high ALK mRNA expression have a negative prognostic significance in rhabdomyosarcoma?,Quantitative assessment of ALK mRNA expression helps to improve risk stratification of RMS patients and identifies tumours with adverse biological characteristics and aggressive behaviour.,0,1.

"The regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) at different stages of the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and their role in glucose homeostasis was investigated. Microarrays were used to assess miRNA expression in skeletal muscle biopsies taken from healthy individuals and patients with pre-diabetes or T2DM, and insulin resistant offspring of rat dams fed a high fat diet during pregnancy. Twenty-three miRNAs were differentially expressed in patients with T2DM, and 7 in the insulin resistant rat offspring compared to their controls. Among these, only one miRNA was similarly regulated: miR-194 expression was significantly reduced by 25 to 50% in both the rat model and in human with pre-diabetes and established diabetes. Knockdown of miR-194 in L6 skeletal muscle cells induced an increase in basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. This occurred in conjunction with an increased glycolysis, indicated by elevated lactate production. Moreover, oxidative capacity was also increased as we found an enhanced glucose oxidation in presence of the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP. When miR-194 was down-regulated in vitro, western blot analysis showed an increased phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3β in response to insulin, and an increase in expression of proteins controlling mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.",Does microRNA-194 modulate Glucose Metabolism and Its Skeletal Muscle Expression Is Reduced in Diabetes?,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with regulation of several miRNAs in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, miR-194 was a unique miRNA that appeared regulated across different stages of the disease progression, from the early stages of insulin resistance to the development of T2DM.

"BRAF mutations activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and often confer an aggressive thyroid cancer (TC) phenotype. Spry2 is an inducible negative feedback regulator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Spry2 in TC. TC cell lines were analyzed for Spry2 expression and MAPK pathway activation. Cells were treated with MEK inhibitor and Spry2 small hairpin RNA. Cells were analyzed for Spry2 expression and MEK/ERK phosphorylation (pMEK, pERK). Thirty human papillary TCs were analyzed for mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activating mutations and Spry2 expression. Increased baseline pMEK levels and Spry2 expression was found in BRAF V600E mutant (BRAF+) cells. MEK inhibition in BRAF+ cells showed decreased Spry2 expression and decreased pMEK/pERK levels.

"In some patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) and a confirmed diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia (LGD), the LGD is not detected during follow-up examinations. We would like to avoid the unnecessary risks and costs of ablative treatment for these patients. Therefore, we investigated whether persistent LGD increases risk for high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and what proportion of patients are no longer found to have dysplasia after an initial diagnosis of LGD. In a retrospective study, we collected information on 1579 patients with BE and LGD from 2005 through 2010 by using a nationwide registry of histopathology diagnoses in the Netherlands (PALGA). Confirmed LGD was defined as a diagnosis of LGD that was confirmed by any other pathologist. Persistent LGD was defined as LGD detected at the first and follow-up endoscopy. Data were collected on patients until treatment for HGD, detection of EAC, or the last endoscopy at which a biopsy was collected (through July 2014). We evaluated whether persistent LGD was a risk factor for malignant progression by using univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses. Of individuals with BE and LGD in the database, the diagnosis of LGD was confirmed for 161 patients (10% of total). In these patients, the incidence of HGD and/or EAC was 5.18/100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.32-8.10/100 person-years) compared with 1.85/100 person-years (95% CI, 1.52-2.22/100 person-years) in patients for whom LGD was not confirmed at the first endoscopy. The incidence of EAC alone in patients with confirmed LGD was 2.51/100 person-years (95% CI, 1.46-3.99/100 person-years), compared with 1.01/per 100 person-years (95% CI, 0.41-2.10/100 person-years) in patients for whom LGD was not confirmed at the first endoscopy. Of patients in whom LGD was confirmed at the first endoscopic examination, 51% were not found to have dysplasia at the first follow-up endoscopy, and 30% had persistent LGD. In patients with persistent LGD, the incidence of HGD and/or EAC was 7.65/100 person-years (95% CI, 4.45-12.34) and of only EAC was 2.04/100 person-years (95% CI, 0.65-4.92); in patients without persistent LGD, the incidence of HGD and/or EAC was 2.32/100 person-years (95% CI, 1.08-4.40/100 person-years) and of only EAC was 1.45 (95% CI, 0.53-3.21/100 person-years).

"To determine the expression of microRNA-210 (miR-210) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to examine its role using HCC cells. The expression of miR-210 was determined in 21 pairs of HCC samples and the corresponding surrounding non-tumor tissues. The effects of miR-210 on proliferation and cell cycle progression were examined using HepG2 and HuH7 cells. Over-expression and inhibition of miR-210 was achieved by transfection of the cells with miR-210 mimic or inhibitor. Luciferase reporter constructs were used to identify the miR-210 interacting site on Yes1. Yes1 expression was examined after miR-210 transfection, as well as in the HCC samples. miR-210 was significantly up-regulated by 3.4 fold (P < 0.01) in the tumor samples. The over-expression of miR-210 significantly reduced cell proliferation compared to the mock-treated cells (68.9% ± 7.4% and 53.6% ± 5.0%, P < 0.05 for the HepG2 and HuH7 cells respectively). Analysis of the HuH7 cells transfected with miR-210 mimic by flow cytometry showed that the cells took a longer time to reach the G2/M phase. The interaction between miR-210 and the 3'UTR of the Yes1 transcript was confirmed using a luciferase reporter assay. Over-expression of miR-210 reduced the expression of Yes1 protein in both HuH7 and HepG2 cells. Tumors with a greater than four-fold increase in the expression of miR-210 showed consistently lower expressions of Yes1 in the tumors. In nocodazole-treated cells with a significant G2/M cell population, Yes1 protein was significantly reduced and pre-inhibition of miR-210 in HuH7 cells was able to prevent the reduction of Yes1 protein expression. Knock-down of Yes1 by siRNA also led to reduced cell proliferation (70.8% ± 7.5%, P < 0.05 in the HuH7 cells).",Does up-regulation of microRNA-210 inhibit proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by targeting YES1?,Up-regulation of miR-210 inhibits cell proliferation.

"Activation of ATP-gated P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) in macrophages leads to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by a mechanism that is partially characterized. Here we used J774 cells to identify the signaling cascade that couples ROS production to receptor stimulation. J774 cells and mP2X7-transfected HEK293 cells were stimulated with Bz-ATP in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium. Protein inhibitors were used to evaluate the physiological role of various kinases in ROS production. In addition, phospho-antibodies against ERK1/2 and Pyk2 were used to determine activation of these two kinases. ROS generation in either J774 or HEK293 cells (expressing P2X7, NOX2, Rac1, p47phox and p67phox) was strictly dependent on calcium entry via P2X7R. Stimulation of P2X7R activated Pyk2 but not calmodulin. Inhibitors of MEK1/2 and c-Src abolished ERK1/2 activation and ROS production but inhibitors of PI3K and p38 MAPK had no effect on ROS generation.

"The use of new drugs has improved the treatment of multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Nevertheless, over time many patients relapse and develop resistance to treatment, and efforts are needed to overcome drug resistance. The widely used malaria drug artesunate has been reported to have antitumor activity, and we aimed to test the effects of artesunate on a panel of myeloma and lymphoma cells. Myeloma and DLBCL cell lines were treated with artesunate in vitro. The effects of artesunate treatment were evaluated using ATP content measurements for proliferation and annexin V/propidium iodide labeling for apoptosis. Western blotting was used to look for artesunate-induced protein changes. In addition, we measured artesunate effects on patient myeloma cells in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells. Artesunate treatment efficiently inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in cell lines. Apoptosis was induced concomitantly with downregulation of MYC and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, as well as with cleavage of caspase-3. The IC50 values of artesunate in cell lines varied between 0.3 and 16.6 μm. Furthermore, some primary myeloma cells were also sensitive to artesunate at doses around 10 μm.

We studied whether off-label thrombolysis was associated with poorer outcome or increased rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage compared with on-label use. All consecutive patients with stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis from 1995 to 2008 at the Helsinki University Central Hospital were registered (n=1104). After excluding basilar artery occlusions (n=119), the study population included 985 patients. Clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2 versus 3 to 6) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage according to 3 earlier published criteria were analyzed with a logistic regression model adjusting for 21 baseline variables.

"Colesevelam is an anion-exchange resin with a 7-fold higher bile acid-binding capacity and fewer side effects than cholestyramine, the current first-line treatment option for cholestatic pruritus. The aim of this trial was to compare the effects of colesevelam and a placebo in patients with cholestatic pruritus. In a randomized, double-blind, investigator-initiated, multicenter trial, patients with cholestatic pruritus, both treatment-naive and previously treated, received 1875 mg of colesevelam or an identical placebo twice daily for 3 weeks. The effect on pruritus was assessed with daily visual analogue scales, quality-of-life scores, and evaluations of cutaneous scratch lesions. The predefined primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with at least a 40% reduction in pruritus visual analogue scale scores. Thirty-eight patients were included, and 35 were evaluable: 17 took colesevelam, 18 took the placebo, 22 were female, 8 were treatment-naive, 14 had primary biliary cirrhosis, and 14 had primary sclerosing cholangitis. The mean serum bile acid levels were comparable between the groups before treatment (P = 0.74), but they were significantly different after treatment (P = 0.01) in favor of patients treated with colesevelam. Thirty-six percent of patients in the colesevelam group reached the primary endpoint versus 35% in the placebo group (P = 1.0). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to pruritus scores, quality-of-life scores, and severity of cutaneous scratch lesions.

"The liver is comparatively rich in plasmacytoid (p) dendritic cells (DC), - innate immune effector cells that are also thought to play key roles in the induction and regulation of adaptive immunity. Liver and spleen pDC were purified from fms-like tyrosine kinase ligand-treated control or lipopolysaccharide-injected C57BL/10 mice. Flow cytometric and molecular biologic assays were used to characterize their function and interaction with naturally occurring regulatory T cells (Treg). While IL-10 production was greater for freshly isolated liver compared with splenic pDC, the former produced less bioactive IL-12p70. Moreover, liver pDC expressed a low Delta4/Jagged1 Notch ligand ratio, skewed towards T helper 2 cell differentiation/cytokine production, and promoted allogeneic CD4(+)T cell apoptosis. T cell proliferation in response to liver pDC was, however, enhanced by blocking IL-10 function at the initiation of cultures. In the absence of naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells, similar levels of T cell proliferation were induced by liver and spleen pDC and the pro-apoptotic activity of liver pDC was reversed.","Is poor allostimulatory function of liver plasmacytoid DC associated with pro-apoptotic activity , dependent on regulatory T cells?","The inferior T cell allostimulatory activity of in vivo-stimulated liver pDC may depend on the presence and function of Treg, a property that may contribute to inherent liver tolerogenicity.",0,Does diminished allostimulatory capacity of hepatic plasmacytoid dendritic cells relate to pro-apoptotic behavior relying on regulatory T lymphocytes?,30.0,2301.0,2468.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,1.7406609058380127,3.475363254547119,6.407327890396118,"Yes, the poor allostimulatory function of liver plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) is associated with their pro-apoptotic activity, and this activity is dependent on regulatory T cells.",0.6
"Fas-mediated apoptosis is important in the regulation of immune response. Human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) are able to regulate peritoneal inflammation, but the role of Fas in HPMCs is not clear. This study addresses the mechanisms of Fas-mediated apoptosis in HPMCs. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) primed HPMCs were stimulated with agonistic anti-Fas antibody. The expression of Fas was evaluated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and flow cytometry. Apoptosis was assessed by nuclear morphology, TUNEL assay, fractional DNA content and cytokeratin 18 cleavage. Caspase activation and bcl-2 expression were analysed by western blotting. The phagocytosis of apoptotic HPMCs was demonstrated by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. Cultured HPMCs constitutively expressed Fas, and the Fas expression was upregulated by TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha primed HPMCs underwent apoptosis after anti-Fas antibody treatment, and the apoptotic HPMCs could be phagocytosed by macrophages. TNF-alpha was able to downregulate bcl-2 expression. Activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8 was noted during the apoptotic process. The inhibitors of either caspase-3 or caspase-8 could prevent the Fas-induced apoptosis in HPMCs.

"Pancreatic cancer originating in the neck of the gland occurs in the small region surrounded by the common hepatic artery (CHA), gastroduodenal artery (GDA), and portal vein (PV). The specific clinicopathologic characteristics of pancreatic neck cancer remain unclear. Our aim was to identify specific biologic behaviors of pancreatic neck cancer for the improvement of treatment outcomes. This study was a retrospective cohort study with a comparative outcomes design. In 63 of 325 consecutive patients (19.4%) with pancreatic cancer who underwent operation, the tumor was located in the pancreatic neck. Clinicopathologic characteristics and prognostic factors specific to pancreatic neck cancer were analyzed by comparison with those of pancreatic head or body/tail cancers.

"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has attracted a great deal of attention in ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in recent years. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) plays an important role in anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity in several animal models.

In the present study, we study the effect of VIP on TLR4 expression in mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 and a mouse partial IR model. The potential inhibitory effect of VIP on TLR4 mRNA and protein in a mouse macrophage cell line and in a mouse model of partial warm hepatic IR injury was assessed. We also assessed the expression tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 in this model. Expression of TLR4 mRNA levels was significantly decreased at 6, 12, and 24 hours after treat with VIP in mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Expression of TLR4 mRNA, TLR4 protein, alanine aminotransferase, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels were significantly increased in the IR group but significantly decreased in groups pretreated with VIP at a concentration of 5 and 10 nmol.

"The Wnt family may contribute to hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance in bone marrow, but many questions remain concerning mechanisms. Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is expressed in cellular compartments of the bone marrow and might contribute to the HSC niche, but mechanisms concerning its constitutive expression are largely unknown. We now explore the influence of Wnt signaling on cellular adhesion molecule expression by bone marrow stromal and hematopoietic cells. Recombinant Wnt ligands, retroviral Wnt transductions and cocultures with Wnt-secreting cells were used to analyze the effect of Wnt on adhesion molecule expression by stromal and hematopoietic cells. In vivo experiments were also done to assess the ability of Wnt3a-induced, VCAM-1 deficient hematopoietic cells to engraft bone marrow. We now report that the beta-catenin-dependent canonical Wnt signaling pathway negatively regulates VCAM-1 expression on two types of bone marrow cells. Wnt pathway inhibitors, Axin (intracellular) or Dickkopf-1 (extracellular) blocked the regulation of VCAM-1 by diffusible Wnt3a. Interestingly, lipopolysaccharide restored a substantial degree of VCAM-1 expression, suggesting functional cross-talk between Wnt and TLR4 signaling pathways.

"Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide; current treatment options have been ineffective in prolonging survival. Agents that target specific signaling pathways (e.g., protein kinase C [PKC]) may regulate apoptotic gene expression rendering resistant cancers sensitive to the effects of other chemotherapeutic drugs. The purpose of our study was to assess the effect of PKC stimulation on apoptotic gene expression in pancreatic cancer cells. The human pancreatic cancer cell line, PANC-1, was treated with PKC-stimulating agents, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or bryostatin-1, and analyzed for expression of apoptosis-related genes. Both PMA and bryostatin-1 induced expression of the pro-apoptotic gene Bad in a dose dependent fashion. The expression of Bad was blocked by the PKC inhibitors GF109203x, Gö6983, and Ro-31-8220, suggesting a role for the conventional isoforms of PKC. In addition, treatment with the MEK inhibitors PD98059 or UO126 reduced PMA-mediated induction of Bad gene expression.

"[corrected] Hind-limb unloading (HU) in rodents has been used as a model to simulate some effects of spaceflight on the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems in humans. HU leads to redistribution of extracellular fluid to the upper half of the body.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either a control, 7-d HU, or 28-d HU group. The expression of ICAM-1 and monocyte adhesion was determined by immunohistochemistry. In control rats, ICAM-1 was not expressed in all vessels studied. HU induced the ICAM-1 expression in the carotid artery and thoracic aorta, but did not in the femoral artery. Staining density of ICAM-1 expression was stronger in the 28-d HU group than in the 7-d HU group.

However, the role of PKA isoforms in regulating the phosphorylation of GPIbβ and platelet response to VWF is unknown. We wished to determine the role of PKA isoforms in the phosphorylation of GPIbβ and platelet activation by VWF as a model for exploring the selective partitioning of cAMP signaling in platelets. The two isoforms of PKA in platelets, type I (PKA-I) and type II (PKA-II), were differentially localized, with a small pool of PKA-I found in lipid rafts. Using a combination of Far Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, proximity ligation assay and cAMP pull-down we identified moesin as an AKAP that potentially localizes PKA-I to rafts. Introduction of cell-permeable anchoring disruptor peptide, RI anchoring disruptor (RIAD-Arg11 ), to block PKA-I/AKAP interactions, uncoupled PKA-RI from moesin, displaced PKA-RI from rafts and reduced kinase activity in rafts. Examination of GPIbβ demonstrated that it was phosphorylated in response to low concentrations of PGI2 in a PKA-dependent manner and occurred primarily in lipid raft fractions. RIAD-Arg11 caused a significant reduction in raft-localized phosphoGPIbβ and diminished the ability of PGI2 to regulate VWF-mediated aggregation and thrombus formation in vitro.","Is targeting of type I protein kinase A to lipid rafts required for platelet inhibition by the 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-signaling pathway?","We propose that PKA-I-specific AKAPs in platelets, including moesin, organize a selective localization of PKA-I required for phosphorylation of GPIbβ and contribute to inhibition of platelet VWF interactions.",0,1.

"The community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) ST93 clone is becoming dominant in Australia and is clinically highly virulent. In addition, sepsis and skin infection models demonstrate that ST93 CA-MRSA is the most virulent global clone of S. aureus tested to date. While the determinants of virulence have been studied in other clones of CA-MRSA, the basis for hypervirulence in ST93 CA-MRSA has not been defined. Here, using a geographically and temporally dispersed collection of ST93 isolates we demonstrate that the ST93 population hyperexpresses key CA-MRSA exotoxins, in particular α-hemolysin, in comparison to other global clones. Gene deletion and complementation studies, and virulence comparisons in a murine skin infection model, showed unequivocally that increased expression of α-hemolysin is the key staphylococcal virulence determinant for this clone. Genome sequencing and comparative genomics of strains with divergent exotoxin profiles demonstrated that, like other S. aureus clones, the quorum sensing agr system is the master regulator of toxin expression and virulence in ST93 CA-MRSA.

"Therapeutic strategies to modulate the host response to bacterial pneumonia are needed to improve outcomes during community-acquired pneumonia. This study used mice with impaired Fas signalling to examine susceptibility to pneumococcal pneumonia and decoy receptor 3 analogue (DcR3-a) to correct factors associated with increased susceptibility. Wild-type mice and those with varying degrees of impairment of Fas (lpr) or Fas ligand signalling (gld) were challenged with Streptococcus pneumoniae and microbiological and immunological outcomes measured in the presence or absence of DcR3-a. During established pneumonia, neutrophils became the predominant cell in the airway and gld mice were less able to clear bacteria from the lungs, demonstrating localised impairment of pulmonary neutrophil function in comparison to lpr or wild-type mice.

"Hypoxemia is a common event in many vascular diseases, especially vascular ischemia. Since endothelial cells of blood vessels are exposed to conditions within the vascular space and leucocytes play a key role in ischemia/reperfusion injury, we hypothesized that endothelial exposure to hypoxia may regulate expression of surface proteins important in leucocyte-endothelial interactions, such as E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1). In this study, we used isolated bovine aortic endothelial monolayers to examine endothelial surface alterations of E-selectin and ICAM-1 induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and hypoxia using a whole cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Bovine endothelial exposure to TNF-alpha (50 ng/mL) induced a time dependent increase (range 0-24h) in specific E-selection surface expression. Endothelial exposure to hypoxia alone (pO2 approximately 3 mmHg, range 0-24 h), however, failed to elicit endothelial E-selectin expression. Endothelial exposure to LPS brought about a dose- and time-dependent (range 0.5 ng/mL and 2-8 h) increase in specific ICAM-1 surface expression (max. 3.5 +/- 0.15-fold increase over no cytokine control at 10 ng/mL, 4 h).

"Natural Killer cells (NK cells) are identified as pivotal mediators in allergic skin diseases and accumulate in lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. Histamine levels are increased in these lesions and histamine is involved in chemotaxis in dendritic cells and NK cells. The aim of this study was to determine if the histamine H4 receptor (H4R) mediates NK cell chemotaxis and whether it influences interplay between NK cells and dendritic cells during the early phase of allergic inflammation. Chemotactic function of the H4R as well as the influence of the H4R on the cytokine profile of an NK cell-dendritic cell co-culture was studied in vitro. The effect of H4R activation on NK cell migration, NK cell-dendritic cell interaction and cytokine levels in the skin was further characterized in the murine TDI model of allergic dermatitis. Additionally, the impact of the H4R on dermal NK cells was determined in the ovalbumin (OVA)- induced allergic dermatitis model, comparing wild type and H4R knockout mice. The selective H4R agonist ST-1006 induced NK cell chemotaxis in vitro, which was inhibited with the H4R antagonist JNJ7777120. In vivo, mice treated with TDI plus ST-1006 topically onto the ear, showed significantly enhanced ear swelling and an increased number of NK cells compared to just allergen challenged ears. CCL17 levels in the ear were also significantly increased 8h after allergen challenge. Histology revealed that the main source for increased CCL17 were dendritic cells. These effects could be blocked using the H4R antagonist JNJ7777120. In the chronic model of allergic dermatitis, OVA induced NK cell migration into lesional skin sites.

"Although the deleterious role of several proinflammatory mediators, including P-selectin, in reperfused stroke is well established, the role of E-selectin has not been fully characterized. E-selectin mRNA expression was studied at 4, 10, and 24 hours after reperfusion with reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction in mice (n=18) subjected to transient intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Mice received intravenous injection with anti-E-selectin monoclonal antibody (10, 35, or 50 microg), nonimmune IgG, or vehicle immediately before MCAO and 90 minutes later (n=85). Others received anti-E-selectin antibody 3 or 6 hours after MCAO (n=32). Myeloperoxidase activity was measured in sham-operated mice and after 10 hours of reperfusion in saline-, nonimmune IgG-, or anti-E-selectin IgG-treated cohorts (n=17). Serial cerebral blood flow was measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry, and outcomes were assessed by neurological deficits and infarct volumes with the use of planimetric analysis of triphenyltetrazolium chloride-stained sections. Upregulated E-selectin expression occurred in the ischemic cerebral vasculature within 4 hours of reperfusion and persisted for 24 hours.

"Coronary flow reserve (CFR) can decrease with impairment in coronary microcirculation, even in the absence of epicardial conduit obstruction. Recently, the ophthalmic artery (OA), which is the first major branch of the internal carotid artery and is representative of microarterioles, has been identified using color Doppler sonography. However, the features of ultrasound waveform indices suggestive of impaired OA microcirculation and the relationships between these indices and CFR have not been elucidated. The present study aimed to assess the features of ultrasound waveform indices suggestive of impaired OA microcirculation and the relationships between these indices and CFR. A total of 30 consecutive patients with a normal coronary angiogram and normal left ventricular function were studied. Patients with ≥ 25% stenosis of the right common or internal carotid artery were excluded. The CFR was defined as the ratio of adenosine-induced hyperemic to baseline blood flow velocity with an intracoronary Doppler guidewire. Color Doppler imaging was used to determine the blood flow velocity of the right OA, and the indices of peripheral resistance (resistance index [RI], pulsatility index [PI], and systolic mean velocity to diastolic mean velocity [Sm/Dm] ratio) were calculated. The ultrasound form showed a distinctive biphasic wave during systole followed by a monophasic wave during diastole. The velocity component in the early-systolic wave was higher than that in the mid-systolic wave or the diastolic wave (31.4 ± 5.1 vs. 26.1 ± 5.4 vs. 15.9 ± 4.0 cm/s, P<0.0001). The RI and PI were not related to the CFR, and the Sm/Dm ratio was negatively correlated with the CFR (β=-0.415, P=0.022). However, the relationship was attenuated by clinical variables closely associated with the Sm/Dm ratio or CFR, and hemoglobin A1c was a common mediator.

"Inhibition of rho-kinase has been shown to attenuate vasopressin (AVP)-induced myocardial ischemia measured as S-wave depression in Donryu rats. This has been attributed to a direct inhibitory effect on AVP-induced coronary vasoconstriction. However, since AVP also increased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) which was attenuated by the rho-kinase inhibitors used, the prevention of myocardial ischemia could have been due to effects on afterload. The purpose of this study was to determine if rho-kinase inhibition prevents S-wave depression independent of the effects on blood pressure. In anesthetized Donryu rats (200-340 g), infusion of AVP (0.1 IU/kg) resulted in a sustained increase in MAP (DeltaMAP=46+/-7 mm Hg) and a transient S-wave depression (-90+/-20 microV). Infusion of phenylephrine titrated to achieve a comparable pressor response (DeltaMAP=52+/-2 mm Hg) resulted in a significantly smaller S-wave depression (-30+/-20 microV). Pretreatment with the rho-kinase inhibitor, hydroxyfasudil (3 mg/kg), decreased MAP by -28+/-2 mm Hg and significantly attenuated AVP-induced S-wave depression (-10+/-10 microV) compared to AVP. When rats were pretreated with phenylephrine titrated to maintain MAP, hydroxyfasudil still significantly attenuated AVP-induced S-wave depression (-14+/-12 microV).

"Ceramides produced by sphingomyelin hydrolysis activate a cycle that is followed by three different major cellular responses: downregulation of cell proliferation, induction of cell differentiation and apoptosis.

"Inflammatory reaction and intimal proliferation of smooth muscle cells are characteristics of vascular stenotic lesions. Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is involved in regulation of inflammation and cell survival in a variety of cell types. We tested a hypothesis that selective inhibition of NF-kappaB by expression of a mutated, nondegradable inhibitor of NF-kappaB, IkappaB-alphaM, would inhibit proinflammatory cytokine expression and proliferation in human vascular smooth muscle cell. Smooth muscle cells were cultured from internal mammary artery and infected with recombinant adenovirus vectors. Adenoviral expression of IkappaB-alphaM inhibited diverse signal-triggered cellular IkappaB-alpha degradation, subsequent NF-kappaB activation, and transactivation of proinflammatory cytokine genes. Expression of IkappaB-alphaM in low-density VSMC led to a 60% reduction in serum-stimulated cell growth and a 10% increment in apoptotic incidence but was without effect in high-density cultures. Coexpression of NF-kappaB p65 attenuated apoptosis in low-density cells induced by IkappaB-alphaM. Therefore, the susceptibility to apoptosis induction in the low-density cells correlated with lower constitutive NF-kappaB activity.

"Variants in genes that regulate autophagy have been associated with Crohn's disease (CD). Defects in autophagy-mediated removal of pathogenic microbes could contribute to the pathogenesis of CD. We investigated the role of the microRNAs (miRs) MIR106B and MIR93 in induction of autophagy and bacterial clearance in human cell lines and the correlation between MIR106B and autophagy-related gene 16L1 (ATG16L1) expression in tissues from patients with CD. We studied the ability of MIR106B and MIR93 to regulate ATG transcripts in human cancer cell lines (HCT116, SW480, HeLa, and U2OS) using luciferase report assays and bioinformatics analyses; MIR106B and MIR93 mimics and antagonists were transfected into cells to modify levels of miRs. Cells were infected with LF82, a CD-associated adherent-invasive strain of Escherichia coli, and monitored by confocal microscopy and for colony-forming units. Colon tissues from 41 healthy subjects (controls), 22 patients with active CD, 16 patients with inactive CD, and 7 patients with chronic inflammation were assessed for levels of MIR106B and ATG16L1 by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Silencing Dicer1, an essential processor of miRs, increased levels of ATG protein and formation of autophagosomes in cells, indicating that miRs regulate autophagy. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that MIR106B and MIR93 targeted ATG16L1 messenger RNA. MIR106B and MIR93 reduced levels of ATG16L1 and autophagy; these increased after expression of ectopic ATG16L1. In contrast, MIR106B and MIR93 antagonists increased formation of autophagosomes. Levels of MIR106B were increased in intestinal epithelia from patients with active CD, whereas levels of ATG16L1 were reduced compared with controls.

"Multiplex immunoassays are increasingly used in epidemiologic studies to measure inflammatory factors, however there are few published evaluations of this technology. Our objective was to compare a common multiplex immunoassay to singleplex immunoassays for measuring inflammatory factors, and to examine how combining data from each affects an epidemiologic association. Plasma IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were measured in 100 samples using a multiplex kit from Mesoscale Discovery (MSD) and singleplex ELISAs from R&D Systems. Separate samples (n=80) were collected to compare multiplex and singleplex assays from MSD. We simulated the effect of combining MSD multiplex and R&D singleplex data on the association between sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) intake and IL-6 in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; n=1314). Compared to R&D ELISAs, the MSD multiplex proportionally and significantly overestimated IL-1 beta (slope=1.2), and IFN-gamma (slope=2.9) but underestimated IL-6 (slope=0.5).

"The evidence for an association between mutations in the HFE (hemochromatosis) gene and the risk of hip or knee osteoarthritis is inconsistent. Total joint replacement is considered a surrogate measure for symptomatic end-stage osteoarthritis. We examined the relationship between HFE gene mutations and risk of total hip and knee replacement using a prospective cohort study. The Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study recruited participants between 1990 and 1994. Participants born in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, or Ireland (n = 27,848) were genotyped for the HFE C282Y mutation. Total hip and knee replacements for osteoarthritis during 2001 to 2009 were ascertained from the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry. Hazard ratios (HR)/odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) were obtained from Cox regression or logistic regression. Compared with those with no C282Y mutation, C282Y homozygotes had an increased risk of single total hip replacement (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.04-3.62) and bilateral total hip replacement (OR 5.86, 95% CI 2.36-14.57) for osteoarthritis, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and educational level.

Nuchal translucency (NT), PAPP-A and betahCG data were extracted from 181 twin pregnancies (31 mono- and 150 dichorionic) with a normal outcome. All pregnancies were consecutively and prospectively included and examined in the Copenhagen First-Trimester Study. The variance of the sum and the difference of log MoM NT values in twin pairs was used to calculate the correlation.

"Tissues respond to injury by releasing acute phase reaction (APR) proteins which regulate inflammation and angiogenesis. Among the genes upregulated in wounded tissues are tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and the acute phase reactant orosomucoid-1 (ORM1). ORM1 has been shown to modulate the response of immune cells to TNFα, but its role on injury- and TNFα-induced angiogenesis has not been investigated. This study was designed to characterize the role of ORM1 in the angiogenic response to injury and TNFα. Angiogenesis was studied with in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo angiogenesis assays. Injured rat aortic rings cultured in collagen gels produced an angiogenic response driven by macrophage-derived TNFα. Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR showed that TNFα and ORM1 were upregulated prior to angiogenic sprouting. Exogenous ORM1 delayed the angiogenic response to injury and inhibited the proangiogenic effect of TNFα in cultures of aortic rings or isolated endothelial cells, but stimulated aortic angiogenesis over time while promoting VEGF production and activity. ORM1 inhibited injury- and TNFα-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and p38 MAPK in aortic rings, but not of NFκB. This effect was injury/TNFα-specific since ORM1 did not inhibit VEGF-induced signaling, and cell-specific since ORM1 inhibited TNFα-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and p38 MAPK in macrophages and endothelial cells, but not mural cells. Experiments with specific inhibitors demonstrated that the MEK/ERK pathway was required for angiogenesis.

"Four main disturbances have been attributed to cholesterol gallstone disease: hypersecretion of cholesterol from the liver with cholesterol supersaturation in bile; disturbed motility with defective absorption and secretion by the gallbladder; increased crystallisation of cholesterol in the gallbladder bile; and slow intestinal transit with increased amount of deoxycholic acid in the bile acid pool. We aimed to evaluate the biliary lipid composition in a large series of gallstone patients, with emphasis on the amount of deoxycholic acid and with respect to number of stones, compared to gallstone free subjects. Bile was sampled during operations through puncture of the gallbladder from 145 cholesterol gallstone patients, 23 patients with pigment stones and 87 gallstone free patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Biliary lipid composition, cholesterol saturation, bile acid composition, nucleation time and cholesterol crystals were analysed. The patients with cholesterol gallstones showed higher molar percentage of cholesterol, lower total biliary lipid concentration, higher cholesterol saturation, shorter nucleation time and higher proportion of crystals in bile than the other groups. The nucleation time was significantly shorter in multiple cholesterol gallstone patients, but this was not due to higher cholesterol saturation. Male cholesterol gallstone patients showed higher cholesterol levels, lower total biliary lipid concentration, and higher cholesterol saturation in bile than female patients.

"Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), majorly associated with nosocomial and community infections worldwide, are emerging as resistant strains to many antibiotics narrowing down the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. In order to investigate the changing resistant pattern of MRSA to empirical drugs, the study was carried out at KIST Medical College and Hospital, Nepal. It also aims to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of vancomycin among MRSA. Altogether 3500 clinical samples including 1303 blood, 1489 urine and 708 body fluids were collected and processed. Isolated S. aureus were further screened for methicillin resistance by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique using cefoxitin (30µg) disk. All MRSA were subjected to in vitro determination of MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method as recommended by CLSI guidelines. Total 287 S. aureus were isolated from the different clinical samples. Altogether 248 (86.41%) were found to be multidrug resistance (MDR) while 42 (14.63%) of the isolates were methicillin resistance with the highest prevalence in the age group of 16-30.

"Mortality in end-stage renal disease patients with dialysis remains high. A high percentage of dialysis patients display signs of chronic microinflammation. To clarify whether microinflammation is involved in the high incidence of poor prognosis in dialysis patients, we investigated the association of inflammatory markers with mortality in a prospective observational cohort study. 120 patients undergoing hemodialysis were enrolled. Baseline cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between inflammatory markers [interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein] and other factors, along with a survival analysis for death, were performed. All subjects were divided into 2 groups according to the median value of IL-6. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the high (20.0%) compared with the low IL-6 group (3.3%, p = 0.0046). Receiver-operating characteristic curves indicated high mortality to be closely associated with a high IL-6 level rather than tumor necrosis factor-alpha.

"Dietary calcium decreases the cytotoxicity of intestinal contents and intestinal epitheliolysis by precipitating cytotoxic surfactants such as bile acids. A decreased luminal cytotoxicity might not only strengthen the barrier function of the gut mucosa but also reinforce the protective, endogenous microflora. We hypothesized, therefore, that dietary calcium increases the resistance to intestinal infections. Rats on a low-, medium-, or high-calcium purified diet were orally infected with a single dose of Salmonella enteritidis. The kinetics of fecal Salmonella excretion was studied to determine the colonization resistance. Intestinal bacterial translocation was quantitated by measuring urinary oxidation products of nitric oxide (NOx) excretion and culturing bacteria from tissues. Compared with the low-calcium group, the medium- and high-calcium diet-fed rats had a substantially improved colonization resistance. Calcium supplementation also reduced translocation of Salmonella, considering the diminished urinary NOx excretion and viable Salmonella counts in the Ileal Peyer's patches and spleen.

"Free radical scavenger edaravone has been approved as a new drug for treatment of stroke patients. The purpose of this study was to examine whether pretreatment with edaravone could attenuate ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced lung damage in infant rabbits. New Zealand White rabbits (Experimental Animal Center, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China) at age from 15 to 21 days were subjected to sham operation, IR, or edaravone plus IR. Ischemia/reperfusion was induced by clamping the right pulmonary hilum for 1 hour and then removal of the clamp for 4 hours. Edaravone (1 mg/kg, intravenous) was given 5 minutes before ischemia. Concentrations of reactive oxygen species-hydroxyl radical (ROS-HR) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the lung tissue were measured. Mitochondrial membrane potential, swelling rate, and ultrastructure of the lung were analyzed, and histologic condition of the lung was evaluated. Edaravone pretreatment reduced markedly the productions of ROS-HR and MDA and increased the activities of GSH-PX and SOD. It attenuated both IR-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential from 60% to 14% and IR-induced increase in mitochondrial swelling.

"In the present study, an arterial tissue-engineered vascular media (TEVM) was produced from cultured human smooth muscle cells of the umbilical artery and we took advantage of this model to evaluate the regulation of contraction and the signalling pathways of polyphenols in arteries. Cultured human smooth muscle cells of the umbilical artery were used to produce arterial TEVMs. Contraction experiments were performed to determine intracellular targets involved in the modulation of contraction by polyphenols extract from red wine, Provinols (SEPPIC Groupe Air Liquide, Paris, France). Smooth muscle cells in arterial TEVM displayed a differentiated phenotype as demonstrated by the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, a vascular smooth muscle-specific marker, and tissue contraction in response to vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents. Contractions caused by histamine were associated with an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and a Ca(2+)-independent signalling pathway. The latter pathway involved mechanisms sensitive to protein kinase C, myosin light chain kinase, and Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitors. The regulation of contraction induced by Provinols shows that treatment of arterial TEVM with this compound significantly decreased histamine-induced contraction.

"Despite the discovery of the p.V617F in JAK2, the molecular pathogenesis of some chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms remains unclear. Although very rare, different studies have identified CBL (Cas-Br-Murine ecotropic retroviral transforming sequence) mutations in V617FJAK2-negative patients, mainly located in the RING finger domain. In order to determine the frequency of CBL mutations in these diseases, we studied different regions of all CBL family genes (CBL, CBLB and CBLC) in a selected group of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. We also included V617FJAK2-positive patients to check whether mutations in CBL and JAK2 are mutually exclusive events.

"During Drosophila embryogenesis, Jun kinase (JNK) signaling has been shown to play a key role in regulating the morphogenetic process of dorsal closure, which also serves as a model for epithelial sheet fusion during wound repair. During dorsal closure the JNK signaling cascade in the dorsal-most (leading edge) cells of the epidermis activates the AP-1 transcription factor comprised of DJUN and DFOS that, in turn, upregulates the expression of the dpp gene. DPP is a secreted morphogen that signals lateral epidermal cells to elongate along the dorsoventral axis. The leading edge cells contact the peripheral cells of a monolayer extraembryonic epithelium, the amnioserosa, which lies on the dorsal side of the embryo. Focal complexes are present at the dorsal-most membrane of the leading edge cells, where they contact the amnioserosa. We show that the JNK signaling cascade is initially active in both the amnioserosa and the leading edge of the epidermis. JNK signaling is downregulated in the amnioserosa, but not in the leading edge, prior to dorsal closure. The subcellular localization of DFOS and DJUN is responsive to JNK signaling in the amnioserosa: JNK activation results in nuclear localization of DFOS and DJUN; the downregulation of JNK signaling results in the relocalization of DFOS and DJUN to the cytoplasm. The HINDSIGHT (HNT) Zn-finger protein and the PUCKERED (PUC) JNK phosphatase are essential for downregulation of the JNK cascade in the amnioserosa. Persistent JNK activity in the amnioserosa leads to defective focal complexes in the adjacent leading edge cells and to the failure of dorsal closure.",Is downregulation of Jun kinase signaling in the amnioserosa essential for dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo?,"Focal complexes are assembled at the boundary between high and low JNK activity. In the absence of focal complexes, miscommunication between the amnioserosa and the leading edge may lead to a premature ""stop"" signal that halts dorsalward migration of the leading edge.

"Dopaminergic activity in the brain is modulated by the dopamine transporter (DAT). Several lines of evidence suggest that a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism of the DAT1 gene (SLC6A3) influences its gene expression.

"Kinase inhibitors are accepted treatment for metastatic melanomas that harbor specific driver mutations in BRAF or KIT, but only 40% to 50% of cases are positive. To uncover other potential targetable mutations, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of a highly aggressive BRAF (V600) and KIT (W557, V559, L576, K642, and D816) wild-type melanoma.

"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a central role in cell proliferation and is regarded as a promising target in cancer therapy, including for ovarian cancer. This study aimed to examine the role of mTOR as a therapeutic target in clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, which is regarded as an aggressive, chemoresistant histologic subtype. Using tissue microarrays of 98 primary ovarian cancers (52 clear cell carcinomas and 46 serous adenocarcinomas), the expression of phospho-mTOR was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Then, the growth-inhibitory effect of mTOR inhibition by RAD001 (everolimus) was examined using two pairs of cisplatin-sensitive parental (RMG1 and KOC7C) and cisplatin-resistant human clear cell carcinoma cell lines (RMG1-CR and KOC7C-CR) both in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that mTOR was more frequently activated in clear cell carcinomas than in serous adenocarcinomas (86.6% versus 50%). Treatment with RAD001 markedly inhibited the growth of both RMG1 and KOC7C cells both in vitro and in vivo. Increased expression of phospho-mTOR was observed in cisplatin-resistant RMG1-CR and KOC7C-CR cells, compared with the respective parental cells. This increased expression of phospho-mTOR in cisplatin-resistant cells was associated with increased activation of AKT. RMG1-CR and KOC7C-CR cells showed greater sensitivity to RAD001 than did parental RMG1 and KOC7C cells, respectively, in vitro and in vivo.",Is mTOR a promising therapeutic target both in cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant clear cell carcinoma of the ovary?,"mTOR is frequently activated in clear cell carcinoma and can be a promising therapeutic target in the management of clear cell carcinoma.

"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a matricellular glycoprotein and recognized as an inhibitor of angiogenesis and an activator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Although TSP-1 expression has been shown to be regulated by various stimuli including UV in some types of cell, more work need to be done to understand the regulation of TSP-1 expression and its functional significances in many other types of cell. In this study, we investigated the effect of UV on TSP-1 expression in human skin dermis and dermal fibroblasts and the role of TSP-1 on the type I procollagen expression after UV exposure. Human buttock skin and human dermal fibroblasts were irradiated with UV. The mRNA and the protein levels of TSP-1 or type I procollagen were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. We found that UV irradiation increased TSP-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in human skin dermis and dermal fibroblasts. UV-induced TSP-1 expression was greatly suppressed by inhibition of the PI3K, Akt, or mTOR pathways.

"Cold ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major cause of graft failure in lung transplantation. Despite therapeutic benefits of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in attenuating acute lung injury, their protection of lung transplants from cold IRI remains elusive. The present study was to test the efficacy of MSCs in the prevention of cold IRI using a novel murine model of orthotopic lung transplantation. Donor lungs from C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 6 h of cold ischemia before transplanted to syngeneic recipients. MSCs were isolated from the bone marrows of C57BL/6 mice for recipient treatment. Gas exchange was determined by the measurement of blood oxygenation, and lung injury and inflammation were assessed by histological analyses. Intravenously delivered MSC migration/trafficking to the lung grafts occurred within 4-hours post-transplantation. As compared to untreated controls, the graft arterial blood oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2) capacity was significantly improved in MSC-treated recipients as early as 4 h post-reperfusion and such improvement continued over time. By 72 h, oxygenation reached normal level that was not seen in controls.

"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB on the proliferation of cells and its possible mechanism in human orbital fibroblasts. Human orbital fibroblasts were obtained from orbital fat from decompression surgery in patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). The cells were treated with PDGF-BB, and the number of cells was counted using an Advanced Detection and Accurate Measurement (ADAM) automatic cell counter. The expression of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) was determined by Western blotting. The effect of PDCD4 on cell proliferation was evaluated using PDCD4 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected cells. The level of microRNA-21 (miRNA-21) was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR.

"Traumatic hemorrhagic shock and subsequent resuscitation may promote bacteria translocation and cause endotoxemia, a two-hit process that will induce severe lung injury. The pathogenesis involves oxidative stress, neutrophil infiltration, and inflammatory response. Platonin, a potent antioxidant, possesses potent anti-inflammation capacity. We sought to elucidate whether platonin could mitigate acute lung injury in a two-hit model of traumatic hemorrhage/resuscitation and subsequent endotoxemia. Adult male rats were randomized to receive traumatic hemorrhage/resuscitation plus lipopolysaccharide (HS/L) alone or HS/L plus platonin (200 μg/kg; n = 12 in each group).

Rats treated with HS/L alone had severe lung injury as evidenced by significant alterations in lung function (i.e., arterial blood gas and alveolar-arterial oxygen difference) and histology. Significant increases in polymorphonuclear leukocytes/alveoli ratio (neutrophil infiltration index) and significant increases in the concentrations of inflammatory molecules (including chemokine, cytokine, and prostaglandin E2) and malondialdehyde (lipid peroxidation index) revealed that HS/L caused significant oxidative stress, neutrophil infiltration, and inflammatory response in rat lungs.

"Progressive liver disease is a severe complication of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease characterized by impaired epithelial adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-dependent secretion caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). In the liver, CFTR is expressed in cholangiocytes and regulates the fluid and electrolyte content of the bile. Glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea and a known CFTR inhibitor, paradoxically stimulates cholangiocyte secretion. We studied the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect and whether glibenclamide could restore cholangiocyte secretion in cystic fibrosis. NRC-1 cells, freshly isolated rat cholangiocytes, isolated rat biliary ducts, and isolated biliary ducts from CFTR-defective mice (Cftr tm1Unc ) were used to study fluid secretion (by video-optical planimetry), glibenclamide-induced secretion (by high-performance liquid chromatography in cell culture medium), intracellular pH and intracellular Ca 2+ concentration transients [2'7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6,carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethylester and Fura-2 f-AM (5-Oxazolecarboxylic acid, 2-(6-(bis(2-((acetyloxy)methoxy)-2-oxoethyl)amino)-5-(2-(2-(bis(2-((acetyloxy)methoxy)-2-oxoethyl)amino)-5-methylphenoxy)ethoxy)-2-benzofuranyl)-, (acetyloxy)methyl ester) microfluorometry], gene expression (by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction), and changes in membrane capacitance (by patch-clamp experiments). Stimulation of cholangiocyte secretion by glibenclamide and tolbutamide required Cl - and was mediated by the sulfonylurea receptor 2B. Glibenclamide-induced secretion was blocked by inhibitors of exocytosis (colchicine, wortmannin, LY294002, and N -ethylmaleimide) and by inhibitors of secretory granule acidification (vanadate, bafilomycin A1, and niflumic acid) but was Ca 2+ and depolarization independent; membrane capacitance measurements were consistent with stimulation of vesicular transport and fusion. Glibenclamide, unlike secretin and forskolin, was able to stimulate secretion in Cftr tm1Unc mice, thus indicating that this secretory mechanism was preserved.",Does glibenclamide stimulate fluid secretion in rodent cholangiocytes through a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-independent mechanism?,The ability of glibenclamide to stimulate secretion in CFTR-defective mice makes sulfonylureas a model class of compounds to design drugs useful in the treatment of cystic fibrosis with liver impairment and possibly of other cholestatic diseases.,0,Does glibenclamide promote fluid secretion in rodent biliary epithelial cells via a mechanism that does not involve the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator?,33.0,2148.0,2312.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.072518110275269,1.4568004608154297,4.685291767120361,"Yes, glibenclamide stimulates fluid secretion in rodent cholangiocytes through a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-independent mechanism.",0.5
"The ability of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) to activate vascular endothelium is unclear. This study investigates the link between endothelial apoptosis and activation in response to TRAIL. Endothelial cell apoptosis was modeled with the immortalized human endothelial cell line EA.hy926, and with primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) sensitized with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 in 1% serum. EA.hy926 expressed greatest levels of TRAIL receptors R1 and R2, and HUVEC of R2 and R3, determined by flow cytometry. Recombinant human (rh)TRAIL induced apoptosis in both models, reducing cell numbers preventable with caspase inhibitors, and confirmed by annexin V staining. In EA.hy926, rhTRAIL activated NF-kappaB (1 h) with increased ICAM-1 expression (24 h). rhTRAIL also increased adhesion of human neutrophils, blocked with an antibody to neutrophil CD18, a ligand for ICAM-1, and with antibodies to TRAIL and TRAIL-R1 and R2. rhTRAIL increased neutrophil adhesion to sensitized HUVEC, without effect on unmodified HUVEC. rhTRAIL did not increase surface labeling of ICAM-1 or E-selectin in sensitized HUVEC.",Does apoptotic phenotype alter the capacity of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand to induce human vascular endothelial activation?,TRAIL increases neutrophil adhesion when it concurrently induces apoptosis both in EA.hy926 and in sensitized HUVEC.

"Mutations in the cardiac type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) have been linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations cause fatal ventricular arrhythmias in young individuals during β-adrenergic stimulation. This study sought to determine the effects of a novel RyR2-G230C mutation and whether this mutation and RyR2-P2328S alter the sensitivity of the channel to luminal calcium (Ca(2+)). Functional characterizations of recombinant human RyR2-G230C channels were performed under conditions mimicking stress. Human RyR2 mutant channels were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells together with calstabin2. RyR2 channels were measured to examine the regulation of the channels by cytosolic versus luminal sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+). A 50-year-old white man with repeated syncopal episodes after exercise had a cardiac arrest and harbored the mutation RyR2-G230C. cAMP-dependent protein kinase-phosphorylated RyR2-G230C channels exhibited a significantly higher open probability at diastolic Ca(2+) concentrations, associated with a depletion of calstabin2.

Both RyR2-G230C and RyR2-P2328S channels exhibit normal luminal Ca(2+) activation.

"Inflammatory stimuli are often associated with marked changes in vascular reactivity. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is and important inflammatory cytokine with diverse effects including the ability to increase vascular endothelial cell permeability and to alter the structure of the endothelial cell glycocalyx. We have previously shown that arteriolar sensitivity to vasoactive materials is influenced by a barrier property of the arteriolar endothelium, and here we test the hypothesis that TNF-alpha might increase intimal permeability and thereby increase the access of circulating arginine-vasopressin (AVP) to vascular smooth muscle. Our objective in the current work was to show that TNF-alpha-mediated modulation of intimal cell permeability may produce both quantitative and qualitative alterations in vascular reactivity to arginine-vasopressin. Hamster cheek pouch arterioles (approximately 65 microm, i.d.) were double-cannulated and perfused. [Arg8]-vasopressin was applied selectively to either the luminal or the adventitial surface of isolated cannulated arterioles. The reactivity of the arterioles to vasopressin was determined in the presence and absence of TNF-alpha (0.625 microg/mL; 1 hour). Adventially applied AVP induced a concentration-dependent vasoconstriction with a threshold of approximately 1 pM, and a maximal constriction at 10 nM. In contrast, luminally applied AVP induced a biphasic response, showing a modest vasodilation in the range of 1 to 100 pM, and constrictions at doses higher than 1 nM. Maximal constrictions were not obtained with luminal doses of AVP as high as 1 microM; (i.e., at doses 100-fold higher than those that produced maximal responses with adventitial application). Dilations induced by luminal application of AVP were significantly attenuated by 10 microM Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), but were not altered by 10 microM indomethacin. After treatment with TNF-alpha, the concentration-response curve for luminally applied AVP showed a more pronounced constriction and the dilator component of the agonist was eliminated. There was no change in the reactivity to adventitially applied AVP or to adventitial applications of acetylcholine. Nonspecific increases in endothelial cell permeability induced by 3-[(3-chloroamino-dopropyl)-dimethylamino]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) also eliminated the potency differences between luminal and adventitial drug application. Following TNF-alpha treatment and loss of the dilator component of the response to AVP, L-NAME was still capable of reducing the arteriolar sensitivity to ACh, thus showing that the endothelial cell machinery for NO production was intact following TNF-alpha treatment.",Does tNF-alpha modulate arteriolar reactivity secondary to a change in intimal permeability?,"Our findings show that the reactivity of intact resistance vessels to agonists that have both endothelial-dependent and smooth muscle cell-dependent components will be complex. Reactivity is the summation of: 1) the relative sensitivities of smooth muscle and endothelial cells to AVP, 2) the release of nitric oxide or other mediators from endothelium, and 3) the restricted access of intraluminal AVP to arteriolar smooth muscle cells. Thus, cytokines, and perhaps other materials that regulate endothelial cell permeability, can modify arteriolar reactivity by altering transendothelial cell access of luminal stimuli to the smooth muscle cells, as well as by acting directly on smooth muscle or by influencing the production of endothelial cell-derived vasoactive materials. In the case of agonists that have an endothelial cell dilator component as well as a smooth muscle constrictor component, this may result in a qualitative change in response as is shown here with AVP.",0,1.

"To date, the available non-invasive remedies for primary aldosteronism are not satisfactory in clinical practice. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3Ks)/protein kinase B (PKB or AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is essential for tumorigenesis and metastasis in many types of human tumors, including renal cancer, adrenal carcinoma and pheochromocytoma. The possibility that this pathway is also necessary for the pathogenesis of primary aldosteronism has not yet been explored. To answer this question, we investigated the activity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in normal adrenal glands (NAGs), primary aldosteronism (PA) patients and NCI-H295R cells. Between January 2005 and December 2011, we retrospectively reviewed the records of 45 patients with PA. We compared clinical characteristics (age, gender and biochemical data) and the expression of phospho-AKT (p-AKT), phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR), phospho-S6 (p-S6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by immunohistochemical staining and western blotting, analyzing 30 aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs), 15 idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) tissues and 12 NAGs following nephrectomy for renal tumors (control group). Compared with the control group, most of the PA patients presented with polydipsia, polyuria, resistant hypertension, profound hypokalemia, hyperaldosteronemia and decreased plasma renin activity. Compared with normal zona glomerulosa, the levels of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-S6 and VEGF were significantly upregulated in APA and IHA. No significant differences were found between APA and IHA in the expression of these proteins. Additionally, positive correlations existed between the plasma aldosterone levels and the expression of p-AKT and p-mTOR. In vitro studies showed that mTOR inhibitor rapamycin could inhibit cell proliferation in NCI-H295R cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, this inhibitor also decreased aldosterone secretion.",Is the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway overactivated in primary aldosteronism?,"Our data suggest that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which was overactivated in APA and IHA compared with normal zona glomerulosa, may mediate aldosterone hypersecretion and participate in the development of PA.",0,Is the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade excessively activated in primary aldosteronism?,21.0,2495.0,2666.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.3964602947235107,2.202110767364502,5.719667434692383,"Yes, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is overactivated in primary aldosteronism, as indicated by significantly upregulated levels of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-S6, and VEGF in aldosterone-producing adenomas and idiopathic hyperaldosteronism compared to normal adrenal glands.",1.0
"Adalimumab is a fully-humanized anti-TNF a antibody that has showed its efficacy in Crohn's disease (CD) adult patients.

"Poor sleep, depression, and anxiety are common in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and associated with increased risk of relapse and poor outcomes. The effectiveness of therapies in improving such psychosocial outcomes is unclear but is an important question to examine with increasing selectivity of therapeutic agents. This prospective cohort enrolled patients with moderate-to-severe CD or UC starting biologic therapy with vedolizumab or anti-tumor necrosis factor α agents (anti-TNF). Sleep quality, depression, and anxiety were measured using validated short-form NIH PROMIS questionnaires assessing sleep and mood quality over the past 7 days. Disease activity was assessed using validated indices. Improvement in sleep and mood scores from baseline was assessed, and regression models were used to identify determinants of sleep quality.

"The recruitment of neutrophils plays an important role in the progress of acute lung injury (ALI). Excessive neutrophils released from bone marrow accumulate in lung, release proinflammatory factors, and cause tissue damage. CXCL-12/CXCR4 is an important signaling pathway, which regulates the migration of bone marrow hematopoietic cells out of bone marrow and involves in neutrophil accumulation and retention in the inflammatory site. Resolvin D1 (RvD1) is a kind of lipid mediators, which can alleviate many inflammatory diseases. We hypothesized that RvD1 can alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI through regulating CXCL-12/CXCR4 pathway.

"Prostate cancer (PCa) is an increasing health issue worldwide. For patients with advanced castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) treatment options are limited and overall survival is relatively short. Paired with this, non-invasive diagnostic options are yet to be established. Activins are members of the TGF-β superfamily and have been linked to prostate physiology. For instance, activin A is an inhibitor of growth in the prostate. A novel class of non-coding RNA, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been intrinsically linked to a range of cellular processes and carcinogenesis. No studies have investigated the impact of activin A on miRNA expression in PCa cell lines. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of activin A on miRNA expression and downstream target genes in PCa. Activin-sensitive (LNCaP) and insensitive (PC3) prostate cells were treated with 50 ng/ml of activin A for 72 hr. To examine miRNA expression following treatment, SYBR RT-qPCR miRNA arrays were used in conjunction with TaqMan RT-qPCR. MiRPath-TarBase analysis was conducted using the miRNAs that were significantly altered following activin A treatment of LNCaP cells to highlight enriched target genes within biological pathways. Highlighted target genes were assessed using pathway-focused TGF-β and cell cycle SYBR RT-qPCR arrays. Activin A treatment altered nine miRNAs in LNCaP cells: miR-222-3p, miR-15b-5p, miR-93-5p, miR-18a-5p, and let-7i-5p were significantly decreased, while miR-30a/30d-5p, let-7c, and miR-196b-5p were significantly increased versus media control.

"Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the most widely used disease-modifying antirheumatoid drugs in the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). We studied its effect on the production of two proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), by peripheral blood cells in patients with JRA. Interleukin-6 and TNFalpha levels were measured at 0 and 4 weeks in whole blood cultures with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in 19 children treated with MTX (10 mg/m(2 )per week) or placebo. Ten healthy individuals were included as healthy controls. Spontaneous production of IL-6 and TNFalpha by peripheral blood cells of patients with JRA was higher than in healthy controls ( P<0.01). However, IL-6 and TNFalpha production after LPS stimulation was similar in healthy controls and patients. The two groups of patients, i.e., those treated with placebo and those treated with MTX, had similar spontaneous and induced IL-6 and TNFalpha production.

To evaluate the effect of small molecule T315 on EGFR degradation and its therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Lung adenocarcinoma cells were treated with T315, and cell proliferation and apoptotic proportion were determined by the CellTiter 96 AQueous MTS (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-5-[3-carboxymethoxyphenyl]-2-[4-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) assay and flow cytometry. The effects of T315 on EGFR mRNA and protein levels, autophosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. Direct targeting of T315 to EGFR was confirmed by the in vitro kinase assay and mass spectrometry. Finally, the preclinical effect of T315 was validated in the murine xenograft model in combination with a second-generation TKI, afatinib. We identified T315 as a novel, potent small molecule for suppressing cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic effect was verified after T315 was combined with a second-generation TKI, afatinib, compared with a single drug administration. We found a new mechanism of action, in that T315 appears to directly bind EGFR and triggers EGFR-Y1045 autophosphorylation, whereby its degradation is triggered through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.",Does small Molecule T315 promote Casitas B-Lineage Lymphoma-Dependent Degradation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor via Y1045 Autophosphorylation?,Our evidence suggests that T315 is a novel class of anticancer drug that is able to inhibit the growth of EGFR-TKI-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells by inducing the degradation of EGFR.,0,1.

"The 5-HT4 receptor provides a novel potential target for antidepressant treatment. No studies exist to elucidate the 5-HT4 receptor's in vivo distribution in the depressed state or in populations that may display trait markers for major depression disorder (MDD). The aim of this study was to determine whether familial risk for MDD is associated with cerebral 5-HT4 receptor binding as measured with [(11)C]SB207145 brain PET imaging. Familial risk is the most potent risk factor of MDD. We studied 57 healthy individuals (mean age 36 yrs, range 20-86; 21 women), 26 of which had first-degree relatives treated for MDD. We found that having a family history of MDD was associated with lower striatal 5-HT4 receptor binding (p = 0.038; in individuals below 40 years, p = 0.013). Further, we found evidence for a ""risk-dose effect"" on 5-HT4 receptor binding, since the number of first-degree relatives with a history of MDD binding correlated negatively with 5-HT4 receptor binding in both the striatum (p = 0.001) and limbic regions (p = 0.012).",Is familial risk for major depression associated with lower striatal 5-HT₄ receptor binding?,"Our data suggest that the 5-HT4 receptor is involved in the neurobiological mechanism underlying familial risk for depression, and that lower striatal 5-HT4 receptor binding is associated with increased risk for developing MDD.

"Plaque disruption does not always result in complete thrombotic occlusion. The mechanism of arterial thrombus propagation remains unclear. We studied how vascular wall thrombogenicity and blood flow reduction affect thrombus propagation using a rabbit model of single and repeated balloon injury. After balloon injury of the normal femoral artery, the blood flow was reduced to 50%, 25%, or 10% (n=5). Small mural thrombi composed of aggregated platelets were produced, but no occlusive thrombi developed in any flow reduction. Three weeks after the first balloon injury, neointima with tissue factor expression and increased procoagulant activity was developed. Balloon injury of the neointima with the same blood flow reduction (n=5) induced fibrin-rich thrombus formation. Additionally, injury with flow reduced to 25% and 10% promoted thrombus propagation resulting in vessel occlusion within 160+/-18 and 71+/-17 seconds, respectively.

"Mechanisms responsible for crypt architectural distortion in chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) are not well understood. Data indicate that serine/threonine protein kinase Akt (Akt) signaling cooperates with Wingless (Wnt) to activate beta-catenin in intestinal stem and progenitor cells through phosphorylation at Ser552 (P-beta-catenin(552)). We investigated whether phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is required for Akt-mediated activation of beta-catenin during intestinal inflammation. The class IA subunit of PI3K was conditionally deleted from intestinal epithelial cells in mice named I-pik3r1KO. Acute inflammation was induced in mice and intestines were analyzed by biochemical and histologic methods. The effects of chemically blocking PI3K in colitic interleukin-10(-/-) mice were examined. Biopsy samples from patients were examined. Compared with wild-type, I-pik3r1KO mice had reduced T-cell-mediated Akt and beta-catenin signaling in intestinal stem and progenitor cells and limited crypt epithelial proliferation. Biochemical analyses indicated that PI3K-Akt signaling increased nuclear total beta-catenin and P-beta-catenin(552) levels and reduced N-terminal beta-catenin phosphorylation, which is associated with degradation. PI3K inhibition in interleukin-10(-/-) mice impaired colitis-induced epithelial Akt and beta-catenin activation, reduced progenitor cell expansion, and prevented dysplasia.

"Type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with microalbuminuria have endothelial dysfunction associated with the degree of albuminuria but not with LDL-cholesterol levels. Lipid-lowering agents such as statins may still be of benefit as they can correct endothelial dysfunction by both lipid and non-lipid mechanisms. We therefore examined the effects of atorvastatin on brachial artery endothelial dysfunction in these patients. In a double-blind, randomized crossover study, 16 Type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with microalbuminuria received 6 weeks of atorvastatin 40 mg/day or placebo, separated by a 4-week washout. Brachial artery, endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and endothelium-independent, glyceryl trinitrate-mediated dilatation (GTNMD) were measured.

"A recent study suggests that patients with persistent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) following treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) have better outcomes than patients with MCA occlusion not receiving rt-PA. We performed a study to elucidate possible mechanisms of this finding in a new model of thromboembolic stroke closely mimicking human pathophysiology. Thromboembolic stroke was induced by local injection of thrombin directly into the right MCA of C57 black/6J mice. Rt-PA was administered 20 and 40 min after clot formation. The efficiency of rt-PA to induce thrombolysis was measured by laser Doppler. After 24 h, all animals were euthanized and interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, Caspase-3, hsp 32 and hsp 70 protein levels were investigated by immunofluorescence. Presence of hemorrhage was verified and infarct volume was measured using histology. Thrombin injection resulted in clot formation giving rise to cortical brain infarction. Early rt-PA treatment starting at 20 min after the clot formation resulted in 100% recanalization. However, rt-PA-induced thrombolysis dissolved the clot in only 38% of the animals when administered 40 min after clot formation. Protein levels of IL-6, TNF-α, MMP-9, Caspase-3, hsp 32 and hsp 70 were increased after MCAO, whereas treatment with rt-PA attenuated the expressions of inflammatory markers in those animals where the thrombolysis was successful.

"Previous studies have investigated the genetic and molecular basis of primary aldosteronism (PA), a common cause of human hypertension, but the effects of microRNAs (miRNAs) on the adrenocortical cell proliferation and aldosterone production are largely obscure. Here, we characterized miRNA expression patterns in the subtypes of PA to gain a better understanding of its pathogenesis. miRNA expression was assessed by microarray profiling analysis in aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), unilateral adrenal hyperplasia (UAH) and normal adrenal cortex tissues. Selected differentially expressed miRNAs were further validated in a validation cohort by qRT-PCR. A gain-of-function approach was used to explore the functional role of the specific miRNA in vitro. Of 31 miRNAs including miR-375, miR-7 and miR-29b were found to be significantly differentially expressed among these three groups. miR-375 was the most downregulated one in adrenal cortex tissues from PA patients, and its expression level was inversely correlated with the tumour size in APA. Overexpression of miR-375 in a human adrenocortical cell line (H295R) reduced cell proliferation and suppressed the expression of MTDH (metadherin, also known as astrocyte elevated gene-1). Moreover, MTDH was verified as a direct target of miR-375 through luciferase reporter assays. Knock-down of MTDH in H295R cells attenuated Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation and inhibited cell viability.",Does downregulation of miR-375 in aldosterone-producing adenomas promote tumour cell growth via MTDH?,Our findings suggest that miR-375 exerts its tumour-suppressive function via targeting MTDH/Akt pathway and implicate a potential therapeutic target in PA.,0,1.

"Studies comparing spondylarthritis (SpA) to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovitis suggest that innate immune cells may play a predominant role in the pathogenesis of SpA. Recent observations have indicated a marked synovial mast cell infiltration in psoriatic SpA. We therefore undertook the present study to investigate the potential contribution of mast cells to synovial inflammation in SpA. Synovial tissue and fluid were obtained from patients with either nonpsoriatic or psoriatic SpA (n=82) and patients with RA (n=50). Synovial biopsy tissue was analyzed by immunostaining and used in ex vivo cultures. Synovial fluid was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We observed a strong and specific increase of c-Kit-positive mast cells in the synovium from patients with SpA compared to the synovium from patients with RA synovitis, which was independent of disease subtype (nonpsoriatic versus psoriatic), disease duration, and treatment. Staining of mast cell granules, analysis of synovial fluid, and results in ex vivo tissue culture did not indicate increased degranulation in SpA synovitis. However, mast cells expressed significantly more interleukin-17 (IL-17) in SpA than in RA synovitis, and mast cells constituted the major IL-17-expressing cell population in the SpA synovium. Ex vivo targeting of synovial mast cells with the c-Kit inhibitor imatinib mesylate significantly decreased the production of IL-17 as well as other proinflammatory cytokines in synovial tissue cultures. Analysis of paired pre- and posttreatment synovial tissue samples indicated that the mast cell/IL-17 axis in SpA was not modulated by effective tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockade.",Do interleukin-17-positive mast cells contribute to synovial inflammation in spondylarthritis?,The specific and TNF-independent increase in IL-17-expressing mast cells may contribute to the progression of synovial inflammation in peripheral SpA.,0,1.

"There is suggestive evidence that reactive oxygen species may play a role in the initiation of liver regeneration via a kupffer cell-mediated mechanism involving TNFa and NF-kappa B. In mammalian cells, a major source of reactive oxygen species derives from the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase system (no protein de novo synthesis is required) and it is known that the low levels of oxidants produced through NADPH oxidase play a role in liver cell proliferation because of peroxisome proliferators. We used knockout mice lacking Cybb: subunit of NADPH oxidase to determine whether signaling at the start of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) involves reactive oxygen species produced through NADPH oxidase and to analyze in more detail the abnormalities caused by lack of its component, which is required for the initiation of liver regeneration.

"Human hypomorphic nuclear factor-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) mutations cause diverse clinical and immunologic phenotypes, but understanding of their scope and mechanistic links to immune function and genotype is incomplete. We created and analyzed a database of hypomorphic NEMO mutations to determine the spectrum of phenotypes and their associated genotypes and sought to establish a standardized NEMO reconstitution system to obtain mechanistic insights. Phenotypes of 72 individuals with NEMO mutations were compiled. NEMO L153R and C417R were investigated further in a reconstitution system. TNF-alpha or Toll-like receptor (TLR)-5 signals were evaluated for nuclear factor-kappaB activation, programmed cell death, and A20 gene expression. Thirty-two different mutations were identified; 53% affect the zinc finger domain. Seventy-seven percent were associated with ectodermal dysplasia, 86% with serious pyogenic infection, 39% with mycobacterial infection, 19% with serious viral infection, and 23% with inflammatory diseases.

"Vascular inflammation is a key feature of both micro- and macrovascular complications in diabetes. Several lines of evidence have implicated the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha as an important mediator of inflammation in diabetes. In the present study we evaluated the role of TNF alpha in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes on vascular inflammation in C57BL/6 wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Diabetes increased the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 in cerebral arteries 150 m in diameter as well as the macrophage accumulation in aortic root atherosclerotic plaques in apoE-/- mice. A more pronounced vascular inflammatory response was observed in diabetic TNF alpha-deficient apoE-/- mice.

"The asymptomatic nature of early-stage esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) results in late presentation and consequent dismal prognosis This study characterized 14-3-3σ protein expression in the multi-stage development of ESCC and determined its correlation with clinical features and prognosis. Western blot was used to examine 14-3-3σ protein expression in normal esophageal epithelium (NEE), low grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN), high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN), ESCC of TNM I to IV stage and various esophageal epithelial cell lines with different biological behavior. Immunohistochemistry was used to estimate 14-3-3σ protein in 110 biopsy samples of NEE, LGIN or HGIN and in 168 ESCC samples all of whom had follow-up data. Support vector machine (SVM) was used to develop a classifier for prognosis. 14-3-3σ decreased progressively from NEE to LGIN, to HGIN, and to ESCC. Chemoresistant sub-lines of EC9706/PTX and EC9706/CDDP showed high expression of 14-3-3σ protein compared with non-chemoresistant ESCC cell lines and immortalized NEC. Furthermore, the downregulation of 14-3-3σ correlated significantly with histological grade (P = 0.000) and worse prognosis (P = 0.004). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that 14-3-3σ protein (P = 0.016) and T stage (P = 0.000) were independent prognostic factors for ESCC.

"The regulation of apoptosis under basal (non-stress) conditions is crucial for normal mammalian development and also for normal cellular turnover in different tissues throughout life. Deficient regulation of basal apoptosis, or its perturbation, can result in impaired development and/or disease states including cancer. In contrast to stress-induced apoptosis the regulation of apoptosis under basal conditions is poorly understood. To address this issue we have compared basal- and stress-induced apoptosis in human epithelial cells of normal and cancerous origins. For this purpose we focussed our study on the opposing pro-apoptotic JNK/anti-apoptotic NFkappaB pathways. Combinatorial RNAi plus gene knockout were employed to access and map basal regulatory pathways of apoptosis. Follow-on, in-depth analyses included exogenous expression of phosphorylation mutants and chromatin immunoprecipitation. We demonstrate that basal apoptosis is constitutively suppressed by JNK2 in a range of human cancer cell lines. This effect was not observed in non-cancer cells. Silencing JNK2 by RNAi resulted in JNK1-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells via up-regulation of the AP-1 factor c-Jun. Unexpectedly we discovered that JNK1 and c-Jun promote basal apoptosis in the absence of ""activating phosphorylations"" typically induced by stress. Hypo-phosphorylated c-Jun accumulated to high levels following JNK2 silencing, auto-regulated its own expression and suppressed expression of Bcl-3, an unusual IkappaB protein and regulator of NFkappaB. Basal apoptosis was mediated by components of the TNFalpha response pathway but was mechanistically distinct from TNFalpha-induced apoptosis.",Does basal cancer cell survival involve JNK2 suppression of a novel JNK1/c-Jun/Bcl-3 apoptotic network?,Our results demonstrate that mechanistically distinct pathways operate to regulate apoptosis in mammalian cells under basal (physiological) versus stress-induced conditions.

"The Notch signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved and regulates cell-fate decisions in a variety of organ development. Previous studies have shown that delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4), one of transmembranous Notch ligands, is up-regulated at the site of tumor growth, especially of tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we examined the effects of the DLL4-Notch signaling on tumor angiogenesis using the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against DLL4. The neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against murine DLL4 (HMD4-2) were newly established, and their effects on tumor growth and angiogenesis were evaluated using the mice subcutaneously implanted human pancreatic cancer cells (PK-1) in the dorsal flank area. To further assess the effects on tumor angiogenesis, PK-1 cells were implanted in skinfold chambers inserted on the dorsal area of the mice. Treatment (intraperitoneally) with HMD4-2 suppressed the in vivo tumor growth with marked decrease of tumor vasculature and had no direct inhibitory effect on PK-1 cells in vitro.

"There is evidence that the immune systems of patients with breast cancer are dysfunctional. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), and IDO, an immunosuppressive enzyme, are associated with more advanced disease in some cancers and may promote immunologic tolerance to tumors. Our aim was to assess whether expression of Foxp3, a marker of Tregs, and IDO were linked with nodal metastasis in breast cancer patients. Inhibitors of IDO are available and could potentially demonstrate utility in breast cancer if IDO drives progression of disease. Sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) of 47 breast cancer patients with varying degrees of nodal disease and 10 controls were evaluated for expression of Foxp3 and IDO using immunohistochemistry. Positively stained cells were quantified and their distribution within the SLN noted. The proportion of Foxp3+ cells was higher in SLN of cancer patients than controls (19% v. 10%, p < 0.001). Specifically, there were more Foxp3+ cells in SLN with metastasis than tumor-free SLN (20% v. 14%, p = 0.02). The proportion IDO+ cell in SLN of cancer patients was not statistically different than controls (4.0% v. 1.6%, p = 0.08).

"To determine whether there is an association between cytokine and chemokine levels in plasma isolated from the placenta and HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). We designed a case-control study of HIV-infected, pregnant women enrolled in the Malaria and HIV in Pregnancy cohort. Participants were recruited in Blantyre, Malawi, from 2000 to 2004. Patients were women whose children were HIV-1 DNA-positive at birth (in-utero MTCT) or HIV-1 DNA-negative at birth and HIV-1 DNA-positive at 6 weeks postpartum (intrapartum MTCT); controls were women whose children were HIV-1 DNA-negative both at birth and 6 weeks postpartum. After delivery, blood was isolated from an incision on the basal plate of the placenta. We used a Bio-Plex human cytokine assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California USA) to simultaneously quantify 27 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in placental plasma.

"To understand the mechanism by which (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol of green tea, exerts its anti-inflammatory action. To check our hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory properties of EGCG could be related to its antifolate action and whether adenosine and its receptors are involved in EGCG action, we investigated the EGCG-induced suppression of NF-kappaB in Caco-2 cell monolayer, which acted as a model of the human intestinal epithelium. We demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory properties of EGCG are associated with its antifolate activity. By using a natural stable folate we were able to reverse the EGCG suppression of TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha and the phosphorylation of Akt in this human colon carcinoma cell line. These suppressions were mediated by the release of adenosine following disruption of the folate cycle by EGCG. By binding to its specific receptors, adenosine can modulate the Akt and NF-kappaB pathway. Moreover, EGCG produces a significant increase in a specific adenosine receptor, which could explain the suppression of the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in colon cancer cells.","Are the anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties of epigallocatechin-3-gallate mediated by folate cycle disruption , adenosine release and NF-kappaB suppression?","The data suggest that by modulating NF-kappaB activation, EGCG might not only combat inflammation, but also cancer.",0,"1.

"We investigated endoglin expression in hypoxic microvascular endothelial cells and retinal endoglin expression in rats that develop experimental oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). We also tested neutralizing antibodies (Abs) against endoglin (anti-CD105 Ab) and VEGF (anti-VEGF Ab) either alone or in combination for efficacy against serum-induced retinal microvascular endothelial cell proliferation and retinal neovascularization (NV) in OIR rats. To our knowledge, this marks the first time that a biologic agent has been used to target retinal endoglin and modulate retinal neovascularization. Induction of endoglin by hypoxia was measured by immunohistochemical analysis and ELISA. Proliferation was quantified using a colorimetric 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine ELISA. Western blots were used to measure endoglin levels in retinas of OIR rats. Immunohistochemical staining was also preformed in OIR rats using anti-CD105 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated isolectin B4 antibodies. Anti-CD105 Ab and Anti-VEGF Ab, administered alone or in combination, reduced serum-induced retinal microvascular endothelial cell proliferation. Additionally, in a rat model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, retinal endoglin was significantly increased at 14(2), 14(3), 14(4) and 14(6) compared with retinal levels in control rats.

"Gastric cancer remains the second cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of shorter dinner-to-bed time, post-dinner walk, and obesity on gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) risk.

Conditional logistic regression was used to calculated odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). The adjusted ORs of GCA for subjects with shorter dinner-to-bed time were 4.18 (95 % CI 2.10-8.33) compared with those with longer dinner-to-bed time. What is more, when reflux symptom was added into the multivariate models, risk estimate for shorter dinner-to-bed time decreased greatly, but still remained statistically significant (p = 0.007).

"In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) macrophages play a major role in amplifying synovial inflammation. Important activating signals are those induced by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and by activated T cells. The balance between activating and inhibitory Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) on macrophages might be crucial in modulating these inflammatory responses. The purpose of this study was to determine FcγR expression on pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages (gmMφ and mMφ, respectively) and identify functional consequences on immune complex uptake and macrophage activation. Human monocytes were isolated and differentiated into gmMφ and mMφ. A full FcγR characterization of both macrophage subtypes was performed and uptake of fluorescent immune complexes (ICs) was determined. FcγRIIb isoforms were determined by qPCR. Macrophages were stimulated via different TLRs or cytokine activated T cells in the presence or absence of ICs and cytokine production was determined. Blocking studies were performed to look into the pathways involved. mMφ expressed high levels of the activating FcγRIIa and FcγRIII and low levels of the inhibitory FcγRIIb, while the FcγR balance on gmMφ was shifted towards the inhibitory FcγRIIb. This was accompanied by a clear increase in FcγRIIb1 mRNA expression in gmMφ. This resulted in higher IC uptake by mMφ compared to gmMφ. Furthermore, FcγR-mediated stimulation of gmMφ inhibited TLR2, 3, 4 and 7/8 mediated cytokine production via FcγRIIb and PI3K signaling. In addition, gmMφ but not mMφ produced TNFα upon co-culture with cytokine activated T cells, which was reduced by IC binding to FcγRIIb.

"Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) play prominent roles in acute respiratory distress syndrome, ischemia-reperfusion injury, trauma, and sepsis. Whereas direct effects of TNF-alpha on PMN function and viability are well documented, little data are available addressing the ability of PMN to communicate with each other in response to cytokine stimulation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether TNF-alpha can modulate PMN function by inducing PMN to secrete products upon stimulation, which would affect other PMN in vitro in a manner independent of cell contact. PMN were purified daily from blood obtained from a pool of 22 healthy volunteers. Conditioned media (CM-TNF) was prepared by incubating PMN in Hanks' balanced salt solution plus TNF-alpha for 1-4 hrs. Freshly isolated PMN were resuspended in CM-TNF and analyzed for 1) phagocytosis of opsonized Escherichia coli, 2) oxidative metabolism as measured as an index of DCF-DA activation, and 3) migration to chemoattractants through Transwell inserts. CM-TNF decreased PMN phagocytotic activity by 8% to 15% and completely suppressed oxidative metabolism but did not modulate the expression of receptors associated with these functions. CM-TNF suppressed the migration of PMN to two biologically relevant agents, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and leukotriene B4, by approximately 65%, but had no effect on PMN migration to interleukin-8.

"Microsatellite instability (MSI) is an established marker of good prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Chromosomal instability (CIN) is strongly negatively associated with MSI and has been shown to be a marker of poor prognosis in a small number of studies. However, a substantial group of ""double-negative"" (MSI-/CIN-) CRCs exists. The prognosis of these patients is unclear. Furthermore, MSI and CIN are each associated with specific molecular changes, such as mutations in KRAS and BRAF, that have been associated with prognosis. It is not known which of MSI, CIN, and the specific gene mutations are primary predictors of survival. We evaluated the prognostic value (disease-free survival, DFS) of CIN, MSI, mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, FBXW7, and TP53, and chromosome 18q loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) in 822 patients from the VICTOR trial of stage II/III CRC. We followed up promising associations in an Australian community-based cohort (N=375). In the VICTOR patients, no specific mutation was associated with DFS, but individually MSI and CIN showed significant associations after adjusting for stage, age, gender, tumor location, and therapy. A combined analysis of the VICTOR and community-based cohorts showed that MSI and CIN were independent predictors of DFS (for MSI, hazard ratio (HR)=0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.93, and P=0.021; for CIN, HR=1.54, 95% CI 1.14-2.08, and P=0.005), and joint CIN/MSI testing significantly improved the prognostic prediction of MSI alone (P=0.028). Higher levels of CIN were monotonically associated with progressively poorer DFS, and a semi-quantitative measure of CIN was a better predictor of outcome than a simple CIN+/- variable.

"TNF-alpha inhibition therapy affects the systemic immune response in rheumatoid arthritis by influencing T cell subtypes (Th1, Th2, Treg), but its effect on the intracellular signal transduction in T cells remains largely unexplored. Here we studied the activation of Th1-associated signalling molecule STAT4 and Th2-associated STAT6 in CD4+ T cells. Eight rheumatoid arthritis patients were studied before and after 12 weeks of adalimumab therapy and compared to 8 healthy individuals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were analysed flow cytometrically either directly after isolation or after 24 hours of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation, to determine spontaneous and IL-4/IL-12-induced STAT4 and STAT6 phosphorylation in CD4+ T cells. Cytokine production by stimulated PBMC was measured in the supernatant using a cytometric bead array. Non-parametric statistical tests were applied. After adalimumab therapy, phospho-STAT6 increased, both in freshly isolated and anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated CD4+ T cells. The STAT6 response to brief IL-4 stimulation did not change. In healthy individuals and adalimumab-treated patients, anti-CD3/anti-CD28 induced the phosphorylation of STAT4, but not in untreated patients. IFN-gamma production in untreated patients was significantly lower than in healthy individuals or adalimumab-treated patients.

"The mechanisms by which plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) regulates inflammation, especially in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are largely unknown. To assess the relationship between PAI-1 and autophagy in inflammatory reactions induced by LPS in rat NR8383 cells. ELISA was used to assess the amounts of TNF-α, IL-1β, and PAI-1 in cell culture supernatants; TLR4, MyD88, PAI-1, LC3, Beclin1, and mTOR protein and mRNA levels were determined by western blot and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively; western blot was used to determine NF-κB protein levels. To further evaluate the role of PAI-1, the PAI-1 gene was downregulated and overexpressed using the siRNA transfection technology and the pCDH-PAI-1, respectively. Finally, the GFP Positive Expression Rate Method was used to determine the rate of GFP-LC3 positive NR8383 cells. In LPS-induced NR8383 cells, TNF-α, IL-1β, and PAI-1 expression levels increased remarkably. Upon PAI-1 knockdown, TNF-α, IL-1β, PAI-1, TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, LC3, and Beclin1 levels were decreased, while mTOR increased.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly grouped into sham-operated (Sham), ischemia reperfusion (IR), MSC-treated (IR+MSC), MSC-derived exosome-treated (IR+MSC-ex) and fibroblast-derived exosome-treated (IR+F-ex) groups. The model for ischemia reperfusion injury was constructed. The serum levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were tested in each group. The histomorphological changes in of renal tissue samples were examined by hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue samples. Cellular apoptosis was examined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis factor α were examined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR.

"Recent reports have observed that individuals with serrated polyps, some of whom meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for Serrated Polyposis Syndrome (SPS), are among those who carry germline mutations in genes associated with polyposis syndromes including; (1) genes known to underlie hamartomatous polyposes (SMAD4, BMPR1A, and PTEN), (2) MUTYH-associated polyposis and (3) GREM1 in Hereditary Mixed Polyposis Syndrome (HMPS). The aim of this study was to characterise individuals fulfilling the current WHO criteria for SPS for germline mutations in these polyposis-associated genes. A total of 65 individuals with SPS (fulfilling WHO criteria 1 or 3), were recruited to the Genetics of Serrated Neoplasia study between 2000 and 2012, through multiple Genetics or Family Cancer Clinics within Australia, or from the New Zealand Familial Gastrointestinal Cancer Service. Individuals with SPS were tested for coding mutations and large deletions in the PTEN, SMAD4, and BMPR1A genes, for the MUTYH variants in exons 7 (Y179C) and 13 (G396D), and for the duplication upstream of GREM1. We found no variants that were likely to be deleterious germline mutations in the SPS cases in the PTEN, SMAD4, and BMPR1A genes. A novel variant in intron 2 (c.164+223T>C) of PTEN was identified in one individual and was predicted by in silico analysis to have no functional consequences. One further individual with SPS was found to be mono-allelic for the MUTYH G396D mutation.

"Radiographic contrast material is one of agents that are prone to cause nephropathy, although little is known about cellular mechanisms underlying contrast media-induced renal failure. The present study was designed to determine the role of caspase in contrast media-induced renal injury. The modulation by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) of cell injury was subsequently examined. LLC-PK1 cells (a proximal renal tubular cell line of porcine origin) were exposed to diverse contrast media for 30 minutes followed by incubation for 24 hours in normal medium. Cell viability was assessed by mitochondrial enzyme activity and propidium iodide stain. Apoptosis was determined by DNA electrophoresis and annexin V stain. Caspase activity was measured fluorometrically. The mRNA for bax and bcl-2 was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Iodinated and magnetic resonance contrast media reduced cell viability due to apoptosis. The cell damage induced by a non-ionic contrast medium ioversol was inhibited by specific inhibitors for caspase-3 and -9 but not caspase-8. Ioversol enhanced the activities of caspase-3 and -9, but to a lesser extent, caspase-8. The bax mRNA was enhanced, while bcl-2 mRNA was reduced, after exposure to ioversol.

"Thalidomide is effective in the treatment of angiodysplasia. The mechanisms underlying its activity may be associated with inhibition of angiogenic factors. It was recently shown that Slit2/Robo1 signaling plays a role in angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the expression and effects of Robo1 and Slit2 in angiodysplasia and to identify the possible therapeutic mechanisms of thalidomide. Slit2 and Robo1 expression were analyzed in tissue samples and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with thalidomide using a combination of laboratory assays that were able to detect functional activity. Slit2, Robo1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were strongly expressed in five angiodysplasia lesions out of seven cases, while expression was low in one out of seven normal tissues.

"Elevated levels of proteases are linked to the malignant phenotype in a wide variety of solid tumors. Therefore, the expression of plasminogen, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), and of the serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in serous epithelial carcinoma of the ovary were investigated. Plasminogen antigen was analyzed in tissue extracts and in the urine of patients with normal (n = 12), benign (n = 6), borderline (n = 9), and invasive serous tumors (n = 22) by Western immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal plasminogen and murine monoclonal angiostatin antibodies. In the same tissue extracts, semiquantitative estimates of MMP-2, MMP-9, total MMP activity, and uPA activity were determined using semiquantitative gelatin zymography in the presence or absence of human plasminogen. Bands corresponding to Glu-plasminogen (approximately 92 kDa) and Lys-plasminogen (approximately 86 kDa) were detected in all ovarian tissues and in corresponding urine samples. Densitometric analysis of combined Glu- or Lys-plasminogen levels showed significantly decreased levels in malignant compared to normal tissue.

"Transcription factor E3 (TFE3) has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity by activating insulin-signalling pathways. However, the role of TFE3 in glucose homeostasis is not fully understood. Here, we explored the possible therapeutic potential of TFE3 for the control of hyperglycaemia using a streptozotocin-induced mouse model of diabetes. We achieved overabundance of TFE3 in streptozotocin mice by administering an adenovirus (Ad) or adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2). We also performed an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT). To explore molecular mechanisms of blood glucose control by TFE3, transcriptional studies on the regulation of genes involved in hepatic glucose metabolism were performed using quantitative real-time PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The binding site of TFE3 in the liver Gck gene promoter was identified using deletion and site-specific mutation studies. Overabundance of TFE3 resulted in reduced hyperglycaemia as shown by the OGTT and ITT in streptozotocin-treated mice. We observed that TFE3 can upregulate Gck in a state of insulin deficiency. However, glucose-6-phosphatase and cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA levels were decreased by Ad-mediated overexpression of Tcfe3. Biochemical studies revealed that the anti-hyperglycaemic effect of TFE3 is due to the upregulation of Gck. In primary cultured hepatocytes, TFE3 increased expression of Gck mRNA.

"Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) are thought to participate in the mucosal defence against bacteria and in the regulation of mucosal tissue homeostasis. Reactivity of IEC to bacterial signals may depend on interactions with immunocompetent cells. To address the question of whether non-pathogenic bacteria modify the immune response of the intestinal epithelium, we co-cultivated enterocyte-like CaCO-2 cells with human blood leucocytes in separate compartments of transwell cultures. CaCO-2/PBMC co-cultures were stimulated with non-pathogenic bacteria and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Expression of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, monocyte chemoattracting protein 1 (MCP-1), and IL-10 was studied by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (cytokine secretion) and by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Challenge of CaCO-2 cells with non-pathogenic E coli and Lactobacillus sakei induced expression of IL-8, MCP-1, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha mRNA in the presence of underlying leucocytes. Leucocyte sensitised CaCO-2 cells produced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta whereas IL-10 was exclusively secreted by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CaCO-2 cells alone remained hyporesponsive to the bacterial challenge. Lactobacillus johnsonii, an intestinal isolate, showed reduced potential to induce proinflammatory cytokines but increased transforming growth factor beta mRNA in leucocyte sensitised CaCO-2 cells.

"Polymyositis (PM) cause pain and weakness of muscle, even threatens patient's lives, but the etiology and pathogenesis of it remains partially understood. Previous studies have proved Cathepsin B (CB) was strongly stained in muscle tissues of PM patients. But no further studies were performed to investigate the role of CB in PM. To investigate the protective effects of CB inhibitor CA-074Me in PM. CB expression, inflammation and apoptosis were analyzed in muscle tissues from patients with PM. Guinea pigs were inoculated intraperitoneally with Coxsackie virus B1 (CVB1) and were then immunized with completely emulsified 0.6ml rabbit muscle homogenates in Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) once a week for consecutive three weeks. The effects of CB inhibitor CA-074Me on CB expression, inflammation and apoptosis were then investigated. Inflammation was assessed by histological examination. Both immunohistochemistry and western blot were used to determine the protein expression. The mRNA levels of CB were measured by Real-Time RT-PCR. The apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay. In patients with PM, the protein levels of CB were significantly up-regulated in muscle tissues compared with healthy controls, which correlated with increases in inflammation score and apoptotic rate in PM patients. Consistently, the expression of CB, inflammation score, CD8(+) T-cell, CD68(+) cell, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) infiltration and apoptotic rate were significantly increased in the guinea-pig model of CVB1-induced polymyositis. Administration of CA-074Me reduced CB expression, decreased inflammation score and attenuated apoptosis in muscle tissues of the guinea-pig model of CVB1-induced polymyositis. The inhibitory effect of CA-074Me on apoptosis was associated with down-regulation of Bax expression and consequent increase in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax.

"Inflammatory mechanisms and immune activation have been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of age-associated diseases such as dementia and atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in a large cohort of centenarians and to look for its possible associations with cognitive function, atherosclerosis, and general health status. Furthermore, we investigated whether the concentration of TNF-alpha was correlated with the blood concentration of leucocyte subsets or the plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, soluble TNF receptor 11 (sTNFR-H) (75 kDa) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Plasma TNF-alpha was measured by ELISA in 126 centenarians, 45 subjects aged 81 years, 23 subjects aged 55-65 years, and 38 subjects aged 18-30 years. Atherosclerosis was evaluated by the ankle-brachial blood pressure index, and general health status was evaluated by the body mass index and the number of diagnoses present. The concentration of TNF-alpha was significantly increased in 126 centenarians compared to younger control groups, and a high concentration of TNF-alpha was associated with both Alzheimer's disease and generalized atherosclerosis in the centenarians.

"Wnt/β-catenin signaling is known to play an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC). Niclosamide, a salicylamide derivative used in the treatment of tapeworm infections, targets the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The objective of this study was to investigate niclosamide as a therapeutic agent against CRC. The antiproliferative effects of 1, 3, 10, and 50 μM concentrations of niclosamide on human (SW480 and SW620) and rodent (CC531) CRC cell lines were determined by MTS assay and direct cell count. The lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1/transcription factor (LEF/TCF) reporter assay monitored the activity of Wnt signaling. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated the expression pattern of active β-catenin. Gene expression of canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling components was analyzed using qRT-PCR. Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies detecting nuclear localization of β-catenin and c-jun. Cell proliferation in CRC cell lines was blocked dose dependently after 12 and 24 h of incubation. The Wnt promoter activity of LEF/TCF significantly decreased with niclosamide concentrations of 10 and 50 μM after 12 h of incubation.

"Several lines of laboratory evidence support a role of persistent activation of Akt pathway in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) progression. Loss of phosphatase PTEN is one of the proposed mechanisms of Akt activation. We sought to determine the prognostic significance of Akt activation in a cohort of patients with OSCC as well as the association between phosphorylated (activated) Akt and PTEN levels. Using a novel system of in situ quantitative protein expression analysis (AQUA), we studied the protein expression levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and PTEN on a tissue microarray. The array included 79 OSCCs with a mean follow-up of 36 months. Patients with tumors expressing low tumor p-Akt levels had lower 5-year local recurrence rates (5% versus 38%). Additionally, these patients had improved 5-year overall survival rates (45% versus 27%). This survival effect was likely due to disease recurrence, as there was no difference in death without recurrence between low- and high-expressing groups.

Seven patients were treated with clonidine 0.2 mg per os (low), and three patients received 0.4 mg per os clonidine (high) before surgery. Eight patients received placebo and served as controls. Continuous spinal anesthesia was provided by insertion of a pliable catheter into the subarachnoid space. Baseline plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained before injection of local anesthetic. Samples were analyzed for TNF-alpha using a biologic assay. Systemic and central release of catecholamines were assessed by high-pressure liquid chromatography measurement of norepinephrine in plasma and CSF, vanillylmandelic acid and methoxy hydroxyl phenyl glycol in 24-h urinary excretion, respectively. Clonidine 0.2 mg pretreatment decreased TNF-alpha concentrations both in plasma and CSF. Patients receiving clonidine had lower pain visual analog scale scores and required less morphine compared with the Placebo group (P < 0.01). Preoperative administration of clonidine decreased catecholamine release in the periphery, as well as in the central nervous system. A smaller norepinephrine concentration in plasma and CSF, and less secretion of vanillylmandelic acid (P < 0.01) and methoxy hydroxyl phenyl glycol in the urine, were observed. Larger dose clonidine (0.4 mg) resulted in no detectable TNF-alpha in CSF. These results suggest that an interaction between TNF-alpha and the function of adrenergic neurons in the central nervous system may contribute to the sedative and analgesic effects of adrenergic agonists.",Does clonidine suppress plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of TNF-alpha during the perioperative period?,"Preoperative administration of clonidine decreases both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in perioperative analgesia and decreased sympathetic tone.",0,1.

"A human neuroblastoma cell line (Paju) was induced by retinoic acid (RA) to differentiate into neuron-like cells. We studied the expression and the possible role of histamine receptors H1 and H2 in retinoic-acid mediated differentiation by semiquantitative RT-PCR. We studied the effect of exogeneously added RA on the morphological change of the human neuroblastoma cell line and the differentiation was followed by vimentine, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament (NF) immunostaining. We monitored the change of the histidine decarboxylase (HDC) expression and the histamine content during the RA treatment by immunoblot and flow cytometry methods.

"Myosin is involved in cell contraction and motility, but it is unclear whether it is involved in cell proliferation in uterine myoma. In this study therefore we aimed to explore the role of myosin in uterine myoma. Immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the expression of myosin light chain (MLC), myosin heavy chain (MHC) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in patient uterine myoma and adjacent smooth muscle tissue. Human uterine fibroid cells were isolated and cultured in vitro, myosin heavy chain 11 (MHC subtype expressed in uterine fibroid cells) was knocked down by RNA interference to reduce the expression of myosin, then cell proliferation was determined by the methyl thiazol tetrazolium bromide method. To explore the possible mechanism of reduced cell proliferation after myosin heavy chain 11 knockdown, the downstream proteins collagen I, insulin-like growth factor-1, fibronectin and proteoglycans were analyzed. Expression of MLC, MHC, MLCK and p-MLCK in uterine myoma cells was significantly higher than in adjacent smooth muscle cells. After knockdown of MHC, smooth muscle cell proliferation decreased, and the production of collagen I, insulin-like growth factor-1 and fibronectin was also reduced, but proteoglycans did not show any significant change.",Is overexpression of myosin associated with the development of uterine myoma?,"Myosin is overexpressed in uterine myoma, and the overexpression of myosin is associated with both uterine contraction and tumor development of uterine myoma.",0,1.

"In people, studies have shown that resistance to fibrinolysis could be a contributing factor to thrombosis. Tissue-plasminogen-activated (t-PA) thromboelastography (TEG) has been used to evaluate endogenous fibrinolytic potential. In dogs, TEG has been used for the diagnosis of various hemostatic disorders, but studies evaluating fibrinolysis are limited. Investigations into the potential of t-PA-modified TEG to monitor endogenous fibrinolytic potential are lacking in both healthy dogs and dogs with diseases predisposing to development of thrombosis. The aim of this study was to compare 3 t-PA-modified TEG assays and compare the endogenous fibrinolytic potential in dogs suffering from diseases associated with thrombosis with a group of healthy dogs. Three different TEG assays, such as native, tissue factor-activated, and kaolin-activated, were modified with t-PA and used to compare whole blood samples from 16 healthy control dogs and 20 diseased dogs. Thromboelastography lysis variables were significantly affected by addition of t-PA in all 3 assays. Lysis results in diseased dogs were comparable to those in healthy dogs prior to addition of t-PA.

"Avarol is a marine sesquiterpenoid hydroquinone with anti-inflammatory and antipsoriatic properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological behaviour of the derivative avarol-3'-thiosalicylate (TA) on some inflammatory parameters related to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Human neutrophils and monocytes as well as the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT were used to study the effect of TA on oxidative stress, the arachidonic acid pathway, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) release and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. All these parameters were also determined in vivo using the zymosan induced mouse air pouch model and the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced mouse epidermal hyperplasia model. TA showed antioxidant properties in human neutrophils and in the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase assay. This compound reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner, leukotriene B(4), prostaglandin E(2) and TNF-alpha production in activated leukocytes. Oral and intrapouch administration of TA in the mouse air pouch model produced a dose-dependent reduction of all these inflammatory mediators. TA also inhibited secretory phospholipase A(2) activity and NF-kappaB DNA-binding in HaCaT keratinocytes. In TPA-induced mouse epidermal hyperplasia, topical administration of TA reduced oedema, leukocyte infiltration, eicosanoid levels and TNF-alpha in skin. In addition, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-2 production were also inhibited. Finally, TA was also capable of suppressing NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in vivo.",Do antipsoriatic effects of avarol-3'-thiosalicylate are mediated by inhibition of TNF-alpha generation and NF-kappaB activation in mouse skin?,TA inhibited several key biomarkers up-regulated in the inflammatory response of psoriatic skin and this compound could be a promising antipsoriatic agent.,0,Are the antipsoriatic properties of avarol-3'-thiosalicylate linked to the suppression of TNF-alpha production and NF-kappaB activation in murine skin?,39.0,2128.0,2312.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.121039390563965,1.9296200275421145,5.561801433563232,"Yes, the antipsoriatic effects of avarol-3'-thiosalicylate (TA) are mediated by the inhibition of TNF-alpha generation and NF-kappaB activation in mouse skin.",0.7
"The objective of this study was to compare functional impairments in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer disease (AD) and their relationship with motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The authors conducted a cross-sectional study of 84 patients with DLB or AD in a secondary care setting. Patients were diagnosed according to published criteria for DLB and AD. The Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS) was used to assess functional impairments. Participants were also assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (motor section), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and the Mini-Mental Status Examination. Patients with DLB were more functionally impaired and had more motor and neuropsychiatric difficulties than patients with AD with similar cognitive scores. In both AD and DLB, there were correlations between total BADLS scores and motor and neuropsychiatric deficits.

"To investigate what effect repetitive stretch has on gene transcription in muscle tissues removed from rats. Case-control study. University laboratory. Eight female 8-week-old Wistar rats. Rat anterior tibial and soleus muscles were removed and repetitively stretched about 20% of the muscle length by using the Magnus method in Krebs-Ringer solution. Stretch-relax cycles 15 times per minute were continued for 2 hours in 1 group and 4 hours in another group. Contralateral muscles removed from the same rat were incubated without stretch as the control. After repetitive stretch, total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from the muscles and Northern blotting was carried out using c-fos and myogenin oligonucleotide as probes. Repetitive stretch during 2 hours significantly increased the expression of c-fos messenger RNA (mRNA) in both the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles. Increased expression of myogenin mRNA in both muscles was observed with repetitive stretch for 4 hours. Because of the initial increase of immediate early gene c-fos mRNA and the subsequent increase of myogenic transcription factor myogenin mRNA, it appears that repetitive muscle stretch induces sequential progression of gene transcription toward muscle hypertrophy.",Does repetitive stretch induce c-fos and myogenin mRNA within several hours in skeletal muscle removed from rats?,Mechanical repetitive stretch for a few hours would be one of the stimulating factors for muscle growth and should be available for muscle training in clinical rehabilitation.,0,1.

"During laser therapy of port wine stain (PWS) birthmarks, regions of persistent perfusion may exist. Immediate retreatment of such regions may improve PWS laser therapeutic outcome. To address this need, we propose use of laser speckle imaging (LSI) to provide real-time, quantitative feedback during laser surgery. Herein, we present in vitro and in vivo data collected with a clinic-based LSI instrument. Prior to clinical implementation, we first investigated three aspects of LSI deemed important for clinical imaging: (1) instrument depth of field (DOF); (2) effects of laser irradiance on speckle flow index (SFI) values; and (3) measurement repeatability. Clinical measurements were acquired from the lesions of PWS patients immediately prior to and after laser therapy at the Beckman Laser Institute. Our preclinical data suggest the following: (1) instrument DOF was approximately 1 cm; (2) quantitative flow characterization with LSI was practically unaffected at normalized irradiance values between 0.06 and 0.5; and (3) our LSI instrument was capable of highly reproducible SFI values. From our clinical measurements, we found that the relative difference between blood perfusion in PWS lesions and adjacent normal skin was highly variable. Based on SFI images, the perfusion of PWS skin is sometimes indistinguishable from that of adjacent normal skin. With laser therapy, we measured a global decrease in blood perfusion, and we frequently observed distinct regions of persistent perfusion.",Do noninvasive blood flow imaging for real-time feedback during laser therapy of port wine stain birthmarks?,Our results demonstrate the potential role of image-guided laser therapy of PWS birthmarks.

"To test the hypothesis that myocardium specific proteins may be useful markers for evaluating the severity of congestive heart failure. Serum concentrations of myosin light chain I (MLC-I), heart fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP), creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), and troponin T (TnT) and plasma concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were determined in 48 patients with acute deterioration of congestive heart failure, both before and after effective treatment. Before treatment, MLC-I (mean (SEM) 3.2 (2.2) microg/l), H-FABP (9.0 (3.5) microg/l), TnT (30 (21) ng/l), and BNP (761 (303) ng/l) were higher than the normal reference range, and concentrations of CK-MB (5.4 (2.9) microg/l) were near normal. Treatment of congestive heart failure with conventional medication significantly decreased the concentrations of MLC-I (1.2 (0.3) microg/l, p < 0.0001), H-FABP (6.0 (2.0) microg/l, p < 0.0001), CK-MB (2.9 (1.5) microg/l, p < 0.0001), TnT (9 (1) ng/l, p < 0.001), and BNP (156 (118) ng/l, p < 0.0001). The decreases in H-FABP and CK-MB concentrations after treatment correlated with the decrease in BNP concentrations (p < 0.05).

"The rate of immunological deterioration and progression to AIDS differs markedly between HIV-positive individuals, and may be influenced by cofactors, HIV phenotype and host T-cell response. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and lymphotoxin stimulate HIV replication and may induce apoptosis of HIV-infected and uninfected lymphocytes in vitro, thus accelerating disease progression and CD4 depletion. Variability in TNF production between individuals is to a degree genetically determined and may be predicted from polymorphisms of microsatellite regions surrounding the human TNF gene locus. We examined TNf microsatellite polymorphisms in 24 HIV-positive patients with slower disease progression (CD4 count > 400 x 10(6)/l at > or = 6 years), 20 HIV-positive patients with faster progression (CD4 count < 200 x 10(6)/l within 5 years) and 109 healthy controls resident in north-west England. Typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of TNF a, b, c and d microsatellites and alleles were defined using fluorescence-based semi-automated microsatellite mapping techniques. No significant differences in TNF a, b and d allele frequencies were observed between faster and slower progressors, or with healthy controls. The frequency of the TNF c2 allele was significantly different between HIV-positive slower (60.9%) and faster (15%) progressors (P = 0.002) with an odds ratio of 0.1 (95% confidence interval, 0-0.6).

"SNP309 T/G (rs2279744) causes higher levels of MDM2, the most important negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor. SNP72 G/C (rs1042522) gives rise to a p53 protein with a greatly reduced capacity to induce apoptosis. Both polymorphisms have been implicated in cancer. The SNP309 G-allele has recently been reported to accelerate diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) formation in pre-menopausal women and suggested to constitute a genetic basis for estrogen affecting human tumorigenesis. Here we asked whether SNP309 and SNP72 are associated with DLBCL in women and are correlated with age of onset, diagnosis, or patient's survival. SNP309 and SNP72 were PCR-genotyped in a case-control study that included 512 controls and 311 patients diagnosed with aggressive NHL. Of these, 205 were diagnosed with DLBCL. The age of onset was similar in men and women. The control and patients group showed similar SNP309 and SNP72 genotype frequencies. Importantly and in contrast to the previous findings, similar genotype frequencies were observed in female patients diagnosed by 51 years of age and those diagnosed later.

"To study the effects of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) inducing protein (Tip-α) on cytokine expression and its mechanism. We cloned Tip-α from the H. pylori strain 26695, transformed Escherichia coli with an expression plasmid, and then confirmed the expression product by Western blotting. Using different concentrations of Tip-α that affected SGC7901 and GES-1 cells at different times, we assessed cytokine levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We blocked SGC7901 cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a specific inhibitor of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). We then detected interleukin (IL)-1β and TNF-α levels in SGC7901 cells. Western blot analysis using an anti-Tip-α antibody revealed a 23-kDa protein, which indicated that recombinant Tip-α protein was recombined successfully. The levels of IL-1β, IL-8 and TNF-α were significantly higher following Tip-α interference, whether GES-1 cells or SGC-7901 cells were used (P < 0.05). However, the levels of cytokines (including IL-1β, IL-8 and TNF-α) secreted by SGC-7901 cells were greater than those secreted by GES-1 cells following treatment with Tip-α at the same concentration and for the same duration (P < 0.05). After blocking NF-κB with PDTC, the cells (GES-1 cells and SGC-7901 cells) underwent interference with Tip-α.

"Platelets have been implicated in cancer metastasis and prognosis. No population-based study has been reported as to whether preoperative platelet count directly predicts metastatic recurrence of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Using a well-characterized cohort of 1,513 surgically resected CRC patients, we assessed the predictive roles of preoperative platelet count in overall survival, overall recurrence, as well as locoregional and distant metastatic recurrences. Patients with clinically high platelet count (≥400 × 10(9)/L) measured within 1 month before surgery had a significantly unfavorable survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.66, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.34-2.05, P = 2.6 × 10(-6), P(log rank) = 1.1 × 10(-11)) and recurrence (HR = 1.90, 1.24-2.93, P = 0.003, P(log rank) = 0.003).

"Inflammatory responses play an important role in the tissue damage during hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Some resolvins have been shown to have protective properties in reducing I/R injury in the heart and kidney. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of resolvin D1 (RvD1) on hepatic I/R. Partial warm ischemia was produced in the left and middle hepatic lobes of Sprague-Dawley rats for 60 min, followed by 6h of reperfusion. Rats received either RvD1 (5 μg/kg) or vehicle by intravenous injection prior to ischemia. On the basis of treatment with RvD1, some rats further received the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Blood and tissue samples from the groups were collected after 6-h reperfusion. Our results indicate that the RvD1 receptor ALX/FPR2 is present in liver, and that pretreatment with RvD1 prior to I/R insult significantly blunted I/R-induced elevations of alanine aminotransferase (AST) and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), and significantly improved the histological status of the liver. Moreover, RvD1 significantly inhibited inflammatory cascades, as demonstrated by attenuations of IL-6, TNF-α and myeloperoxidase levels. Reduced apoptosis, and increased phosphorylation of Akt, were observed in the RvD1 group compared with the control I/R group.

"Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors are promising epigenetic agents for the treatment of various subsets of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the resistance of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) to BET inhibitors remains a major challenge. In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms underlying LSC resistance to the BET inhibitor JQ1. We evaluated the levels of apoptosis and autophagy induced by JQ1 in LSC-like leukemia cell lines and primary CD34 JQ1 effectively induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in JQ1-sensitive AML cells. However, in JQ1-resistant AML LSCs, JQ1 induced little apoptosis and led to upregulation of beclin-1, increased LC3-II lipidation, formation of autophagosomes, and downregulation of p62/SQSTM1. Inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitors or knockdown of beclin-1 using specific siRNA enhanced JQ1-induced apoptosis in resistant cells, indicating that prosurvival autophagy occurred in these cells. Independent of mTOR signaling, activation of the AMPK (pThr172)/ULK1 (pSer555) pathway was found to be associated with JQ1-induced autophagy in resistant cells.

"The c-myc oncogene product (c-Myc) is a transcription factor that forms a complex with Max and recognizes the E-box sequence. c-Myc plays key functions in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. As for its activity towards cell proliferation, it is generally thought that c-Myc transactivates the E-box-containing genes that encode proteins essential to cell-cycle progression. Despite the characterization of candidate genes regulated by c-Myc in culture cells, these have still not been firmly recognized as real target genes for c-Myc. We found that c-Myc directly bound to the N-terminal region of origin recognition complex-1 (ORC1), a region that is responsible for gene silencing, in a state of complex containing other ORC subunits and Max in vivo and in vitro.

"The overexpression of PKCalpha or PKCgamma for extended periods of time causes the formation of lentoid bodies in the N/N 1003A rabbit lens epithelial cell line. To determine how differentiated the lentoid bodies are, we have looked for alphaA-, alphaB-, beta-, and gamma-crystallin levels in lentoid bodies after 4 and 8 weeks of lentoid body development. Cells overexpressing PKCalpha or PKCgamma were plated in 6 well plates and were allowed to form lentoid bodies for up to 8 weeks. Lentoid bodies were fixed and stained with PKCalpha or PKCgamma antibodies along with either alphaA-, alphaB-, beta-, or gamma-crystallin antisera and viewed under a confocal microscope. Lentoid bodies were harvested in lysis buffer and homogenized. Fifty micrograms of protein per lane was loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel and the bands transferred onto nitrocellulose. The blot was probed with either alphaA-, alphaB-, beta-, or gamma-crystallin antibodies for 12 h. Total RNA from lentoid bodies was isolated and 5 microg of total RNA was transcribed to first-strand cDNA. The PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. alphaB-crystallin was present in normal N/N 1003A cells and the lentoid bodies formed from PKCalpha and PKCgamma overexpression. alphaA-crystallin was only detectable in lentoid bodies after PKCalpha or PKCgamma overexpression.

"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is involved in inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases but the role of MIF in liver injury has not yet been elucidated. We investigated biochemically, histologically and immunologically the character of MIF in concanavalin A (Con A)-induced T-cell-mediated liver injury using MIF knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. MIF KO mice showed significantly decreased serum alanine aminotransferase values and suppressed histological change with massive necrosis of the hepatic parenchymal cells and infiltration of inflammatory cells compared with their WT counterparts. This protection was not mediated by either tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interferon-gamma, which are critical mediators of Con A-induced liver injury, as their serum concentrations were shown to be similar in MIF KO and WT mice.

"During hemorrhagic hypotension, sympathetic vasoconstriction crucially contributes to gut mucosal damage. Sympathetic blockade by thoracic epidural anesthesia has been shown to increase mucosal microvascular perfusion and to improve survival after severe hemorrhage in laboratory animals. This study investigates the effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia on intestinal microvascular perfusion during hemorrhagic hypotension in rats. In 32 anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats either lidocaine 2% (thoracic epidural anesthesia) or normal saline (control) was infused via thoracic epidural catheters. Hemorrhagic hypotension (mean arterial pressure 30 mmHg for 60 min) was induced by withdrawal of blood, which was subsequently retransfused for resuscitation. Functional capillary density and erythrocyte velocity in the mucosa and muscularis were determined by intravital microscopy. Leukocyte-endothelium interaction was studied in postcapillary venules and sympathetic nerve fibers of the intestinal wall were identified by immunohistochemistry.

"We have previously reported that activated CD8+TCRalphabeta+ cells that express high levels of the beta7 integrin CD103 (formerly alphaE, MLA) are present at the graft site during clinical renal allograft rejection. This observation potentially provides new insight into the mechanisms underlying renal allograft destruction because the ligand of CD103 is the epithelial cell-specific molecule E-cadherin, which is known to be expressed by critical graft functional elements such as the renal tubular epithelium. We herein used combined fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of transplant nephrectomy (TN) specimens to demonstrate that CD103+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specifically home to the graft epithelium during rejection episodes. Serial sections of TN specimens undergoing histologically confirmed cellular rejection (n=7) were stained with anti-CD8 or anti-CD103 and were scored for the presence of positively stained cells within the tubular basement membrane. Freshly isolated graft-infiltrating lymphocytes were subjected to three-color FACS analyses to define the extended phenotypic characteristics of CD103+ cells detected by IHC. CD103+ cells in all specimens were biased towards an intratubular localization. On average, the percentage of CD103+ cells with an intraepithelial localization was 52.2+/-13.1 compared to 12.0+/-3.5 for pan CD8+ cells (mean+/-SE, n=5). FACS analyses confirmed that CD103+ cells detected by IHC exhibited the salient characteristics of CD8+ CTLs (large CD8+TCRalphabeta+CD62L-CD11a(hi)perforin+).

"The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is released in the lung by sensory nerves during allergic airway responses. Pulmonary dendritic cells (DC) orchestrating the allergic inflammation could be affected by CGRP. To determine the immunomodulatory effects of CGRP on DC function and its impact on the induction of allergic airway inflammation. CGRP receptor expression on lung DC was determined by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining. The functional consequences of CGRP receptor triggering were evaluated in vitro using bone marrow-derived DC. DC maturation and the induction of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific T cell responses were analysed by flow cytometry. The in vivo relevance of the observed DC modulation was assessed in a DC-transfer model of experimental asthma. Mice were sensitized by an intrapharyngeal transfer of OVA-pulsed DC and challenged with OVA aerosol. The impact of CGRP pretreatment of DC on airway inflammation was characterized by analysing differential cell counts and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung histology and cytokine responses in mediastinal lymph nodes. RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and cAMP assay demonstrated the expression of functionally active CGRP receptors in lung DC. RT-PCR revealed a transcriptional CGRP receptor down-regulation during airway inflammation. CGRP specifically inhibited the maturation of in vitro generated DC. Maturation was restored by blocking with the specific antagonist CGRP(8-37) . Consequently, CGRP-pretreated DC reduced the activation and proliferation of antigen-specific T cells and induced increased the numbers of T regulatory cells.

"The content of GC-rich ribosomal repeats (rDNA) in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of patients with various diseases is several times higher as compared with genomic DNA (gDNA) and cfDNA of healthy donors. rDNA may act as Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligands and affect human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (haMSCs). Here we explore effects of human cfDNAs and model rDNA fragments on cultured haMSCs. Both cfDNAs and cloned rDNA stimulate expression of TLR9 (qRT-PCR). Treatment with cloned rDNA leads to an increase in the number of TLR9(+) cells (FACS), expression levels for both TLR9 and Myd88, the translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B to the nuclei and up-regulation of TNFα and IL-10 cytokines (ELISA). As shown by an analysis of γH2AX-foci and MTT test, the preconditioning of haMSCs with cloned rDNA fragment increases the resistance of these cells to irradiation at 2Gy, while the treatments with control gDNA did not stimulate either TLR9- or NF-kB-dependent signaling pathways.",Does extracellular GC-rich DNA activate TLR9- and NF-kB-dependent signaling pathways in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( haMSCs )?,GC-rich sequences present in cfDNA stimulate endogenous stems cells when body is exposed to adverse conditions.

"Loss of function mutations of Park7/DJ-1 gene increase the susceptibility of dopaminergic cells to reactive oxygen species and cause early onset familial Parkinson disease (PD). However, the mechanisms underlying dopaminergic neuron loss related to DJ-1 mutation remain undefined. Therefore, it is important to find the new mechanisms underlying the antioxidative functions of DJ-1. DJ-1 knockdown cells and DJ-1 knockout mice were used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the antioxidative stress of DJ-1. Preliminary study of the saliva from PD patients and controls was used to confirm our findings obtained from the above studies. Our experiments showed that DJ-1 interacted with Erk1/2 and was required for the nuclear translocation of Erk1/2 upon oxidative stimulation. The translocation of Erk1/2 activated Elk1 and sequentially promoted superoxide dismutase1 (SOD1) expression. The nuclear translocation of Erk1/2, the activation of Elk1, and the ensuing upregulation of SOD1 were all suppressed in DJ-1 knockdown cells and DJ-1 null mice treated with oxidative insult. Furthermore, reintroduction of SOD1 into DJ-1 knockdown cells protected them against oxidative stress.

"Overexpression of progranulin (also named acrogranin, PC-cell-derived growth factor, or granulin-epithelin precursor) is associated with ovarian cancer, specifically with cell proliferation, malignancy, chemoresistance, and shortened overall survival. The objective of the current study is to identify the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of progranulin expression in ovarian cancer cell lines. We studied the relation of protein kinase C (PKC), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase A, P38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and Akt pathways on the modulation of progranulin expression levels in NIH-OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cell lines.

"Although the mechanisms and pathways mediating ARDS have been studied extensively, less attention has been given to the mechanisms and pathways that counteract injury responses. This study found that the apelin-APJ pathway is an endogenous counterinjury mechanism that protects against ARDS. Using a rat model of oleic acid (OA)-induced ARDS, the effects of ARDS on apelin and APJ receptor expressions and on APJ receptor binding capacity were examined. The protective effect of activating the apelin-APJ pathway against OA- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS was evaluated. ARDS was coupled to upregulations of the apelin and APJ receptor. Rats with OA-induced ARDS had higher lung tissue levels of apelin proprotein and APJ receptor expressions; elevated plasma, BAL fluid (BALF), and lung tissue levels of apelin-36 and apelin-12/13; and an increased apelin-APJ receptor binding capacity. Upregulation of the apelin-APJ system has important pathophysiologic function. Stimulation of the apelin-APJ signaling using receptor agonist apelin-13 alleviated, whereas inhibition of the apelin-APJ signaling using receptor antagonist [Ala]-apelin-13 exacerbated, OA-induced lung pathologies, extravascular lung water accumulation, capillary-alveolar leakage, and hypoxemia. The APJ receptor agonist inhibited, and the APJ receptor antagonist augmented, OA-induced lung tissue and BALF levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and plasma and lung tissue levels of malondialdehyde.

"Adiponectin has anti-inflammatory properties and is increased with weight loss. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that negatively regulates adiponectin. Previously, we have demonstrated that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) induces weight loss and improves steatosis in obese rats. We hypothesized that RYGB would alter the interplay of TNF-α and adiponectin signaling in the postoperative period. Obese Sprague-Dawley male rats that had undergone RYGB (n = 5) or sham (n = 4) were euthanatized at 9 weeks postoperatively.

"Regular gall bladder contraction reduces bile stasis and prevents gallstone formation. Intraduodenal administration of exogenous pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor-I (PSTI-I, also known as monitor peptide) causes cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion. We proposed that stimulation of CCK release by PSTI would produce gall bladder contraction and prevent gallstones in mice fed a lithogenic diet. Therefore, we tested the effect of overexpression of rat PSTI-I in pancreatic acinar cells on plasma CCK levels and gall bladder function in a transgenic mouse line (TgN[Psti1]; known hereafter as PSTI-I tg). Importantly, PSTI tg mice had elevated fasting and fed plasma CCK levels compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Only mice fed the lithogenic diet developed gallstones. Both fasting and stimulated plasma CCK levels were substantially reduced in both WT and PSTI-I tg mice on the lithogenic diet. Moreover, despite higher CCK levels PSTI-I tg animals developed more gallstones than WT animals.",Does endogenous elevation of plasma cholecystokinin prevent gallstones?,"Together with the previously observed decrease in CCK-stimulated gall bladder emptying in mice fed a lithogenic diet, our findings suggest that a lithogenic diet causes gallstone formation by impaired CCK secretion in addition to reduced gall bladder sensitivity to CCK.",0,Can increased levels of plasma cholecystokinin inhibit gallstone formation?,16.0,2257.0,2405.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.4931154251098633,1.629460334777832,4.183156967163086,"No, endogenous elevation of plasma cholecystokinin does not prevent gallstones, as evidenced by the finding that PSTI-I transgenic mice, which had elevated CCK levels, developed more gallstones than wild-type mice when fed a lithogenic diet.",0.2
"Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is the second most common cause of death in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Recent studies have implicated enhanced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) leak via type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) as a cause of VT in the mdx mouse model of DMD. However, the signaling mechanisms underlying induction of SR Ca(2+) leak and VT are poorly understood. To test whether enhanced Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation of RyR2 underlies SR Ca(2+) leak and induction of VT in mdx mice. Programmed electrical stimulation was performed on anesthetized mice and confocal imaging of Ca(2+) release events in isolated ventricular myocytes. Programmed electrical stimulation revealed inducible VT in mdx mice, which was inhibited by CaMKII inhibition or mutation S2814A in RyR2. Myocytes from mdx mice exhibited more Ca(2+) sparks and Ca(2+) waves compared with wild-type mice, in particular at faster pacing rates. Arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves were inhibited by CaMKII but not by protein kinase A inhibition.

"There is currently widespread exposure to the toxic metal cadmium through the diet as well as through smoking, and it has been suggested that cadmium exposure may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Here we examined whether cadmium exposure is associated with prevalence and growth of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries. The analyses were performed in a screening-based cohort of 64-year-old Caucasian women with stratified, random selection to groups with normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes (n = 599). We measured cadmium concentrations in blood and urine at baseline. In addition, we performed ultrasound examination to determine the prevalence and area of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries and assessed smoking history and other cardiovascular risk factors at baseline and at a follow-up examination after a mean of 5.4 years. At baseline, blood cadmium levels were associated with increased risk of plaque and a large plaque area after adjustment for confounders. In women who had never smoked, blood cadmium levels correlated positively with plaque area at baseline. The occurrence of large plaques and the change in plaque area at follow-up were associated with blood and creatinine-corrected urinary cadmium concentrations at baseline after adjustment for confounders. Blood and urine cadmium levels added information to established cardiovascular risk factors in predicting progress of atherosclerosis.",Is cadmium exposure accompanied by increased prevalence and future growth of atherosclerotic plaques in 64-year-old women?,We have shown that cadmium levels in blood and urine are independent factors associated with the development of atherosclerotic plaques at baseline as well as prospectively.

"The aim of the study was to determine the degree of neuropathy (autonomic and somatic) in patients with diabetes mellitus with or without Charcot osteoarthropathy (CA). Forty-nine patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 were investigated. The patient population of interest was the patients with acute Charcot foot (n=17) or chronic Charcot foot (n=7). The inclusion criterion for an acute Charcot foot was a temperature difference of more than 2° between the two feet, oedema of the affected foot, typical hotspots in a bone scintigram and a typical clinical course. In addition, patients with first toe amputation (n=5), a high-risk group for development of CA, and two control groups consisting of diabetes patients with (n=9) or without somatic neuropathy (n=11) were investigated. Regional blood flow in the feet was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Quantitation of somatic neuropathy was done by the Neuropathy Disability Score and modified Neuropathy Symptom Score. Quantitation of autonomic neuropathy was done by measurements of local venoarteriolar sympathetic axon reflex in the feet and of heart rate variability during deep breathing and orthostatic challenge. The patients with acute Charcot foot and first toe amputation had an increased blood flow in the affected foot and weakened but not absent venoarteriolar sympathetic axon reflex. In the other patient groups, a normal venoarteriolar sympathetic axon reflex in the feet was found.",Does sympathetic neuropathy in diabetes mellitus patients elicit Charcot osteoarthropathy?,Peripheral sympathetic neuropathy is not likely to be the pathophysiologic mechanism behind the hyperemia in the foot during an acute attack of CA.

Elevated plasma lactate has been shown to correlate with mortality in patients with septic shock. Heat stress prior to sepsis has resulted in reduction in acute lung injury and mortality. We investigated whether heat stress resulted in decreased plasma lactate concentration and protected the lung by decreasing the inflammatory response to sepsis. Plasma lactate concentration was elevated in septic rats without prior heat stress. Lactic acid levels were significantly lower in heat-treated septic rats (P < 0.05) and were not significantly different when compared with control rats. Septic rats with or without heat pretreatment had significantly higher myeloperoxidase activity in the lung than did control groups.

"Patients with cholestatic disease have increased systemic concentrations of bile acids (BAs) and profound pruritus. The G-protein-coupled BA receptor 1 TGR5 (encoded by GPBAR1) is expressed by primary sensory neurons; its activation induces neuronal hyperexcitability and scratching by unknown mechanisms. We investigated whether the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is involved in BA-evoked, TGR5-dependent pruritus in mice. Co-expression of TGR5 and TRPA1 in cutaneous afferent neurons isolated from mice was analyzed by immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, and single-cell polymerase chain reaction. TGR5-induced activation of TRPA1 was studied in in HEK293 cells, Xenopus laevis oocytes, and primary sensory neurons by measuring Ca(2+) signals. The contribution of TRPA1 to TGR5-induced release of pruritogenic neuropeptides, activation of spinal neurons, and scratching behavior were studied using TRPA1 antagonists or Trpa1(-/-) mice. TGR5 and TRPA1 protein and messenger RNA were expressed by cutaneous afferent neurons. In HEK cells, oocytes, and neurons co-expressing TGR5 and TRPA1, BAs caused TGR5-dependent activation and sensitization of TRPA1 by mechanisms that required Gβγ, protein kinase C, and Ca(2+). Antagonists or deletion of TRPA1 prevented BA-stimulated release of the pruritogenic neuropeptides gastrin-releasing peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide B in the spinal cord. Disruption of Trpa1 in mice blocked BA-induced expression of Fos in spinal neurons and prevented BA-stimulated scratching. Spontaneous scratching was exacerbated in transgenic mice that overexpressed TRG5.

"The spatial organization of the genome is being evaluated as a novel indicator of toxicity in conjunction with drug-induced global DNA hypomethylation and concurrent chromatin reorganization. 3D quantitative DNA methylation imaging (3D-qDMI) was applied as a cell-by-cell high-throughput approach to investigate this matter by assessing genome topology through represented immunofluorescent nuclear distribution patterns of 5-methylcytosine (MeC) and global DNA (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole = DAPI) in labeled nuclei. Differential progression of global DNA hypomethylation was studied by comparatively dosing zebularine (ZEB) and 5-azacytidine (AZA). Treated and untreated (control) human prostate and liver cancer cells were subjected to confocal scanning microscopy and dedicated 3D image analysis for the following features: differential nuclear MeC/DAPI load and codistribution patterns, cell similarity based on these patterns, and corresponding differences in the topology of low-intensity MeC (LIM) and low in intensity DAPI (LID) sites. Both agents generated a high fraction of similar MeC phenotypes across applied concentrations. ZEB exerted similar effects at 10-100-fold higher drug concentrations than its AZA analogue: concentration-dependent progression of global cytosine demethylation, validated by measuring differential MeC levels in repeat sequences using MethyLight, and the concurrent increase in nuclear LIM densities correlated with cellular growth reduction and cytotoxicity.",Do 3-D DNA methylation phenotypes correlate with cytotoxicity levels in prostate and liver cancer cell models?,"3D-qDMI demonstrated the capability of quantitating dose-dependent drug-induced spatial progression of DNA demethylation in cell nuclei, independent from interphase cell-cycle stages and in conjunction with cytotoxicity.

"An experimental physiologic and histologic study of dexamethasone effects on peripheral nerves. To characterize the effect of topically applied 0.4% dexamethasone on acute changes in nerve blood flow and subsequent histologic changes in rat sciatic nerve fibers. Dexamethasone is an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid used clinically to reduce the neural consequences of inflammation. Several reports of accidental injury to nerves after steroid injections have raised questions about the mechanisms involved in dexamethasone-induced neurotoxic injury. Nerve blood flow studies using a laser Doppler flowmeter were conducted in animals with stable temperature and arterial pressure. Dexamethasone 0.4%, 0.1 mL was applied topically to rat sciatic nerve in the following protocol groups: 1) nerve blood flow recording every 5 minutes for 30 minutes, and 2) initial nerve blood flow recording and repeat recording at 4 hours. Three additional animals had 30-minute nerve blood flow recordings in which normal saline was substituted for dexamethasone; these animals were used for control and to assure that the experimental preparation was viable throughout the observational period. Additional groups of two animals each received dexamethasone but were used only for neuropathologic observation at 2, 4, and 6 days after treatment. Neuropathologic studies were conducted on glutaraldehyde-fixed, plastic-embedded tissue. Application of saline to the exposed sciatic nerves did not significantly change nerve blood flow from baseline values. Nerve blood flow values remained constant throughout the observational period. Dexamethasone, however, significantly reduced nerve blood flow in both the 30-minute and 4-hour groups. Some animals showed an initial transient increase in blood flow before nerve blood flow began to steadily decline to the final values reported. Neuropathologic changes were minimal and consisted only of edema and occasional subperineurial activation of Schwann cells. No demyelination or degeneration was seen.",Does dexamethasone decrease blood flow in normal nerves and dorsal root ganglia?,"Dexamethasone causes statistically significant reductions in normal nerve blood flow at 30 minutes and 4 hours after topical application; however, the reduction is on average below the threshold for causing ischemic changes in the structure of peripheral nerve fibers.",0,Does dexamethasone reduce circulation in healthy nerves and dorsal root ganglia?,17.0,2654.0,2801.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.660023212432861,2.5617687702178955,5.354159116744995,"Yes, dexamethasone decreases blood flow in normal nerves, as indicated by the significant reduction in nerve blood flow observed in the study.

"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccination is recommended worldwide for patients with chronic liver disease to prevent decompensation due to superinfection with HAV. India being endemic for HAV, the prevalence of pre-existing antibodies against HAV due to subclinical exposure to the virus in childhood among patients with chronic liver disease may be high and, therefore, vaccination may not be needed. However, data are lacking on the prevalence of HAV antibody among patients with chronic liver disease in India. Two hundred fifty-four patients attending the Liver Clinic at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi during the past 5 years and diagnosed to have either chronic hepatitis due to the hepatitis B virus (n = 76), hepatitis C virus (n = 84) or cirrhosis of the liver due to the hepatitis B (n = 47) or C (n = 47) virus were tested for the presence of IgG anti-HAV antibody in their sera (using a commercial ELISA kit). Two hundred forty-eight (97.6%) patients tested positive for IgG anti-HAV.

"One of the earliest activation events following stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) is the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) within the CD3-associated complex by the Src family kinase Lck. There is accumulating evidence that a large pool of Lck is constitutively active in T cells but how the TCR is connected to Lck and to the downstream signaling cascade remains elusive. We have analyzed the phosphorylation state of Lck and Fyn and TCR signaling in human naïve CD4+ T cells and in the transformed T cell line, Hut-78. The latter has been shown to be similar to primary T cells in TCR-inducible phosphorylations and can be highly knocked down by RNA interference. In both T cell types, basal phosphorylation of Lck and Fyn on their activatory tyrosine was observed, although this was much less pronounced in Hut-78 cells. TCR stimulation led to the co-precipitation of Lck with the transmembrane adaptor protein LAT (linker for activation of T cells), Erk-mediated phosphorylation of Lck and no detectable dephosphorylation of Lck inhibitory tyrosine. Strikingly, upon LAT knockdown in Hut-78 cells, we found that LAT promoted TCR-induced phosphorylation of Lck and Fyn activatory tyrosines, TCRζ chain phosphorylation and Zap-70 activation. Notably, LAT regulated these events at low strength of TCR engagement.",Does t cell receptor signal initiation induced by low-grade stimulation require the cooperation of LAT in human T cells?,Our results indicate for the first time that LAT promotes TCR signal initiation and suggest that this adaptor may contribute to maintain active Lck in proximity of their substrates.,0,"1.

"Successful drug treatment for sepsis-related acute lung injury (ALI) remains a major clinical problem. This study was designed to assess the beneficial effects of post-treatment of oroxylin A (OroA), a flavonoid, in ameliorating lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced lung inflammation and fatality. Rats were injected with LPS (10 mg/kg, iv) to induce ALI, and OroA was given (15 mg/kg, iv) 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge. Twenty four hrs after LPS challenge, biochemical changes in the blood and lung tissues, and morphological/histological alterations in the lung associated with inflammation and injury were examined.

"Superficial mucosal damage is associated with mucosal hyperemia and release of histamine into venous blood and gastric lumen. This study was designed to examine if histamine administrated directly to gastric mucosa becomes absorbed and transported away with blood, and if so whether it is capable of increasing gastric mucosal blood flow. Superficial mucosal injury was induced by exposing chambered rat stomachs to 2 M NaCl for 10 min, and 45 min later 4.5 x 10(-2) or 4.5 x 10(-3) M histamine was instilled into the chamber. Mucosal blood flow was determined by radioactive microspheres and continuously by Laser Doppler flowmetry.

"Fetal tissue is considered to be immune privileged and is under extensive investigation as a source of tissue for transplantation. In this paper, we analyzed the immune properties of human fetal and neonatal skin before and after transplantation to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Using a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell reconstituted SCID (huPBMC-SCID) mouse model of allograft rejection, we compared the immune response to transplanted fetal and neonatal skin. We analyzed human fetal (55-122 days of gestation) and neonatal skin samples by routine histology and immunohistochemistry for the expression of (MHC class I and II antigens before and after transplantation to SCID mice. After transplantation, we injected the mice with huPBMCs and analyzed the survival of neonatal and fetal skin grafts both visually and microscopically. We detected no class II expression in fetal skin of all gestational ages and only weak class I expression after 89 days compared with abundant class I and II expression in neonatal skin before transplantation. When transplanted to SCID mice, fetal skin grafts differentiated and expressed class I and II, but the levels were lower than neonatal grafts. In mice injected with huPBMCs, rejection of neonatal grafts started on day 5, and by day 9 all grafts were rejected. In contrast, rejection of fetal skin grafts was significantly delayed. Rejection started on day 13 and was complete by day 23 (P<0.00005).

"The observation of local 'elementary' Ca2+ release events (Ca2+ sparks) through ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) has changed our understanding of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in cardiac and smooth muscle. In arterial smooth muscle, Ca2+ sparks have been suggested to oppose myogenic vasoconstriction and to influence vasorelaxation by activating co-localized Ca2+ activated K+ (K(Ca)) channels (STOCs). However, all prior studies on Ca2+ sparks have been performed in non-human tissues. In order to understand the possible significance of Ca2+ sparks to human cardiovascular function, we used high spatial resolution confocal imaging to record Ca2+ sparks in freshly-isolated, individual myocytes of human coronary arteries loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fluo-3. Local SR Ca2+ release events recorded in human myocytes were similar to 'Ca2- sparks' recorded previously from non-human smooth muscle cells. In human myocytes, the peak [Ca2+]i amplitudes of Ca2+ sparks (measured as F/F0) and width at half-maximal amplitude were 2.3 and 2.27 microm, respectively. The duration of Ca2+ sparks was 62 ms.

"It has been hypothesized that increased plasma bile acids (BAs) contribute to metabolic improvements after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery by the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5-mediated effects on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion and thyroid hormones. The objective of this study was to evaluate the importance of bariatric surgery-induced alterations in BA physiology on factors that regulate glucose homeostasis (insulin secretion and sensitivity) and energy metabolism (resting energy expenditure and thyroid hormone axis). DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTION, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Eighteen extremely obese subjects were studied before and after 20% weight loss, induced by either laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) (n = 10) or RYGB surgery (n = 8).

"C-met and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) have been associated with the resistance mechanism of EGFR-TKIs. HGF was evaluated as a clinical-marker of response in NSCLC patients treated with afatinib. Sixty-six patients with stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma and progression to any-line chemotherapy received afatinib 40 mg/day. Mutational EGFR and HER2 status were assessed by RT-PCR. HER2 amplification was evaluated by FISH. Serum HGF content was measured by ELISA before and 2 months after the start of treatment. HGF levels were assessed with the objective response rate (ORR), progression-free-survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01542437. Fifty patients (75 %) were EGFR mutation positive. Response was achieved in 59 % of all patients and 78 % of EGFR mutated patients. Median PFS was 10 [95 % CI 6.8-13.1] and 14.5 months [10.9-18.9] for all and EGFR mutated patients, respectively.

"The standard approach to determine unique or shared genetic factors across populations is to identify risk alleles in one population and investigate replication in others. However, since populations differ in DNA sequence information, allele frequencies, effect sizes, and linkage disequilibrium patterns, SNP association using a uniform stringent threshold on p values may not be reproducible across populations. Here, we developed rank-based methods to investigate shared or population-specific loci and pathways for childhood asthma across individuals of diverse ancestry. We performed genome-wide association studies on 859,790 SNPs genotyped in 527 affected offspring trios of European, African, and Hispanic ancestry using publically available asthma database in the Genotypes and Phenotypes database. Rank-based analyses showed that there are shared genetic factors for asthma across populations, more at the gene and pathway levels than at the SNP level. Although the top 1,000 SNPs were not shared, 11 genes (RYR2, PDE4D, CSMD1, CDH13, ROBO2, RBFOX1, PTPRD, NPAS3, PDE1C, SEMA5A, and CTNNA2) mapped by these SNPs were shared across populations. Ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2, a statin response-related gene) showed the strongest association in European (p value=2.55×10(-7)) and was replicated in African (2.57×10(-4)) and Hispanic (1.18 × 10(-3)) Americans.

"Multiple studies have demonstrated a link between periodontal infections and vascular disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a major periodontal pathogen, has been shown to adhere to and invade endothelial cells. In order to dissect mechanisms underlying these observations, we assessed the role of P. gingivalis infection in modulating properties of endothelial cells linked to atherothrombosis. Primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) were infected with either P. gingivalis 381 or its non-invasive fimbriae-deficient mutant, DPG3. Markers of coagulation and thrombosis were assessed 8 h and 18 h postinfection in cell lysates and supernatants. Infection with P. gingivalis 381 significantly enhanced tissue factor expression and activity, and suppressed levels of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Furthermore, P. gingivalis infection decreased levels and activity of tissue plasminogen activator, and enhanced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen and activity. Consistent with an important role for bacterial adhesion/invasion in this setting, infection with DPG3 failed to induce procoagulant properties in HAEC. Most of the above effects of P. gingivalis 381 were more apparent at the later time point (18 h postinfection). This suggests that P. gingivalis infection, rather than having an immediate and direct effect, might activate pathways that, in turn, trigger endothelial procoagulant mechanisms.",Does infection with a periodontal pathogen induce procoagulant effects in human aortic endothelial cells?,Taken together these data demonstrate for the first time that infection with a periodontal pathogen induces procoagulant responses in HAEC.,0,1.

"EphrinA5, a member of Eph/Ephrin family, possesses two alternative isoforms, large ephrinA5 isoform (ephrinA5L) and small ephrinA5 isoform (ephrinA5S). EphrinA5L is a putative tumor suppressor in several types of human cancers. However, the role of ephrinA5S in hepato-carcinogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we evaluate the role of ephrinA5 isoforms in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). A total of 142 paired HCCs and peritumoral liver tissue was examined for relative expression of ephrinA5L and ephrinA5S by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We analyzed their expression in relation to clinical parameters, disease-free survival and overall survival. Functional assays were performed to dissect the possible underlying mechanisms. Both ephrinA5L and ephrinA5S were significantly downregulated in HCCs, as compared to those in peritumoral tissue (p = 0.013 and 0.001). Univariate analysis demonstrated that ephrinA5S was positively correlated with old age and histological grade. In multivariate analysis, high ephrinA5S expression in peritumoral tissue had better disease-free survival (p = 0.002) and overall survival (p = 0.045) in patients with HCC after surgical resection. Functional analysis in HCC cell lines revealed that ephrinA5S had a more potent suppressive effect than ephrinA5L on cell proliferation (p<0.05) and migration (p<0.01). Furthermore, forced expression of both ephrinA5 isoforms in HCC cell lines significantly down-regulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression by promoting c-Cbl-mediated EGFR degradation.",Does peritumoral small ephrinA5 isoform level predict the postoperative survival in hepatocellular carcinoma?,"EphrinA5S might be a useful prognostic biomarker for HCCs after surgical resection.

"Stroke patients without evidence of arterial occlusion may not be suitable candidates for thrombolytic therapy. In our study, we investigated the outcomes of patients with negative CT angiography results for arterial occlusion. The study included patients treated within 3 hours after symptom onset with intravenous thrombolysis for significant neurological deficit between August 2003 and June 2007. All of the patients were documented with negative CT angiography results for arterial occlusion by independent reviews. Outcome measurements included modified Rankin score at 3 months, incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, and infarction volume on control CT. The predictors of unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin score, 2-6) were identified by multivariate logistic regression. Altogether, 173 patients received intravenous thrombolysis; of those, 138 underwent CT angiography.

"To explore the effects of FLT3 signaling on the accumulation and maturation of pulmonary conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and determine whether or not the inhibition of FLT3 signaling may attenuate acute lung inflammation/injury (ALI). C57BL/6 mice were pretreated separately with FLT3-ligand (FLT3L) and lestaurtinib for 5 days. Murine model of ALI was subsequently induced by an intra-tracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lung specimens were harvested 24 hours later. The accumulation and maturation status of pulmonary cDCs were assessed by flow cytometry. Lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured to evaluate the infiltration of neutrophils. The ratio between transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3 mRNA was determined to estimate the balance of Th1/Th2 response. Lung injury was estimated by lung wet weight/body weight ratio (LWW/BW) and histopathological assessment. LPS challenge resulted in rapid accumulation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs. FLT3L pretreatment further stimulated the accumulation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs, leading to a marked deterioration of LWW/BW and lung histopathological changes. Meanwhile, the lung MPO activity and T-bet/GATA-3 mRNA ratio were boosted by the administration of FLT3L. In contrast, the lestaurtinib pretreatment inhibited the accumulation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs, leading to a significant improvement of LWW/BW and lung histopathological changes.

"To examine association between periodic leg movements (PLM) and 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 6 loci known to increase risk of restless legs syndrome (RLS). Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine and Clinical Research Unit of University of Wisconsin Institute for Clinical and Translational Research. Adult participants (n = 1,090, mean age = 59.7 years) from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (2,394 observations, 2000-2012). A previously validated automatic detector was used to measure PLMI. Thirteen SNPs within BTBD9, TOX3/BC034767, MEIS1 (2 unlinked loci), MAP2K5/SKOR1, and PTPRD were tested. Analyses were performed using a linear model and by PLM category using a 15 PLM/h cutoff. Statistical significance for loci was Bonferroni corrected for 6 loci (P < 8.3 × 10(-3)). RLS symptoms were categorized into four groups: likely, possible, no symptoms, and unknown based on a mailed survey response. Prevalence of PLMI ≥ 15 was 33%. Subjects with PLMs were older, more likely to be male, and had more frequent RLS symptoms, a shorter total sleep time, and higher wake after sleep onset. Strong associations were found at all loci except one. Highest associations for PLMI > 15/h were obtained using a multivariate model including age, sex, sleep disturbances, and the best SNPs for each loci, yielding the following odds ratios (OR) and P values: BTBD9 rs3923809(A) OR = 1.65, P = 1.5×10(-8); TOX3/BC034767 rs3104788(T) OR = 1.35, P = 9.0 × 10(-5); MEIS1 rs12469063(G) OR = 1.38, P = 2.0 × 10(-4); MAP2K5/SKOR1 rs6494696(G) OR = 1.24, P = 1.3×10(-2); and PTPRD(A) rs1975197 OR = 1.31, P = 6.3×10(-3).

"Glutamate transporters play an important role in maintaining extracellular glutamate homeostasis. Volatile anesthetics have been shown to affect glutamate transporter activity acutely (within minutes after the exposure). It is not known whether volatile anesthetics affect the expression of glutamate transporters. Rat cultured C6 glioma cells that express excitatory amino acid transporter type 3 (EAAT3) were exposed to isoflurane at various concentrations (0.5-4.0%) or for different periods (1-24 h) at 37 degrees C. EAAT3 mRNA, proteins, and activity were quantified. Isoflurane induced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in the mRNA and protein levels of EAAT3 in C6 cells. The maximal increase was induced by 2% isoflurane, and the cells incubated with 2% isoflurane for 3 and 7 h expressed the highest levels of EAAT3 mRNA and proteins, respectively. Similarly, glutamate uptake was higher in C6 cells exposed to 2% isoflurane for 7 h than in control cells. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide, inhibitors for mRNA and protein synthesis, respectively, did not affect the isoflurane-induced increase in EAAT3 mRNA and protein expression. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a protein kinase C activator, also enhanced EAAT3 expression. The combination of 2% isoflurane and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate caused a higher level of EAAT3 expression than that induced by 2% isoflurane alone.

"Chronic vascular rejection, the main cause of allograft failure, is characterized by the destruction of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the media concomitantly with the proliferation of SMCs in the adjacent neointima. We hypothesized that alloantibodies might be responsible for these 2 opposite but coordinated events. We used the rat aortic interposition model of chronic vascular rejection. During the rejection process, a neointima composed of proliferating SMCs from the recipient developed, whereas the SMCs in the media, all of donor origin, underwent apoptosis. Alloantibody deposition was detected only in the media. Using in vitro cultures experiments, we observed that alloantibody binding to donor SMCs exerts (1) a rapid upregulation of the transcription of growth factors genes, followed by (2) the induction of apoptosis after 24 hours. The transient production of growth factors by donor SMCs in response to the binding of alloantibodies induced the proliferation of recipient SMCs in culture supernatant transfer experiments.

"Children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) have a high rate of relapse and death in the year following recovery. In this pilot study, we evaluate the long-term benefits of an extended course of nutritional therapy for children with MAM. Rural Malawian children 6 to 59 months old with MAM, defined as a weight-for-height z score (WHZ) between -2 and -3, were provided supplementary feeding for a fixed duration of 12 weeks. The children were then studied for 12 months to assess long-term nutritional status, and compared with children initially treated only until they first reached WHZ > -2. Compared with children treated until they reached WHZ > -2, children treated for 12 weeks were more likely to remain well nourished (71% vs 63%, P = 0.0015) and maintain more normal anthropometric indices during 12 months of follow-up; there was also a trend towards lower rates of severe acute malnutrition (7% vs 10%, P = 0.067) and death (2% vs 4%, P = 0.082).

"Depression is a common mood disorder affecting stroke patients. It is associated with poorer outcome and increased mortality in stroke patients. The aim of this work was to test whether serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines are correlated with the development of depression after stroke. One hundred ischemic stroke patients admitted to the hospital within the first 24 hours after stroke onset were consecutively recruited and followed up for 6 months. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were used to screen for depressive symptoms on days 3, 7 and 14 after admission and at 6 months after stroke onset. Based on the symptoms elicited from these two scales, diagnoses of depression were made in accordance with DSM-IV criteria for post-stroke depression. Serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-alpha) of all the patients were determined by ELISA on both days 1 and 7 after admission. Meanwhile, 50 healthy control subjects were also recruited; they underwent measurement of serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines once. Thirty-seven patients (37.0%) were diagnosed as having major depression at 2 weeks. Serum IL-18 on both days 1 and 7 was significantly higher in both post-stroke depression patients and non-post-stroke depression patients than in normal controls. Serum IL-18 on day 7 was significantly higher in post-stroke depression patients than in non-post-stroke depression patients.

"Cholestatic liver injury results from the intrahepatic accumulation of toxic bile salts. Toxic bile salt-induced hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro is Fas dependent. The aim of this study was to ascertain if hepatocyte apoptosis in vivo during cholestasis is Fas dependent.

Hepatocyte apoptosis was the predominant mechanism of cell death as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling and trypan blue assays to quantitate apoptosis and necrosis. The mechanisms of hepatocyte apoptosis were dependent on the presence or absence of the Fas receptor and the duration of BDL. After BDL of 3 days' duration, increased hepatocyte apoptosis occurred only in wild-type but not lpr mice, indicating the apoptosis was Fas dependent.

"In the first period of life, premature infants need parenteral nutrition. Lipid emulsions (LEs), which are a part of parenteral nutrition, are known as potent immunological modulators and may therefore influence the immune status of parenterally fed infants. The aim of the study was to compare tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 production in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of premature infants parenterally fed with 2 LEs: olive oil (OO) and soybean oil (SO). Premature infants born at <32 weeks' gestation and with a birth weight <1500 g were randomized in a double-blind method within the first 48 hours of life to receive 1 of 2 LEs: OO based or SO based. At baseline and after 14 days, blood samples were collected, and PBMCs were isolated and then cultured for 48 hours in medium only and in the presence of anti-CD3 antibodies. Of 44 recruited infants, 38 completed the study, 18 in the OO group and 20 in the SO group. The cytokine synthesis profile before the LE introduction was the same in both groups (nonstimulated and anti-CD3-induced PBMC).

"Activation of endothelial adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) contributes to increase nitric oxide (NO) availability. The aim of this study was to assess if high-fat diet (HFD)-induced endothelial dysfunction is linked to AMPK deregulation.

HFD rats segregated in obesity-prone (OP) or obesity-resistant (OR) rats according to body weight. HFD triggered an impaired glucose management together with impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation, reduced endothelial AMPK activity and lower NO availability in aortic rings of OP and OR cohorts. Relaxation evoked by AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) was reduced in both OP and OR rings, which exhibited lower p-AMPKα-Thr(172) /AMPKα ratios that negatively correlated with plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and triglycerides (TG). Inhibition of PI3K (wortmannin, 10(-7) M) or Akt (triciribine, 10(-5) M) reduced relaxation to AICAR only in the control group (p < 0.001).

"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) plays a central role in atherosclerosis. To investigate the effects of a direct renin inhibitor aliskiren on vascular inflammation, we conducted leukocyte adhesion assays in vivo and in vitro using a novel real-time imaging system. Aliskiren (10 mg/kg/d) or PBS was administered to C57BL/6 mice (6-7 weeks of age; Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan) for 2 weeks via an osmotic pump. Blood pressure was not significantly changed in the 2 groups throughout the experimental period.

"Bioactives extracted from cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) stems were investigated for their chemopreventive activities using human cancer cells in vitro. The bioactives present in crude extracts were detected and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Among all the extracts, such as hexane, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), acetone, methanol (MeOH), and MeOH:water (80:20), the MeOH extract had the highest amount of polyphenolic compounds and the acetone extract exhibited the most potent effect at scavenging the 2,2,-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS(•+) ) radical.

"Inflammation is essential for atherogenesis. Cholesterol, a cardiovascular risk factor, may activate inflammation in the vessel wall during this process. Cytokine-mediated interactions of human monocytes with vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) may perpetuate this process. We investigated the capacity of the cholesterol metabolite 25-hydroxycholesterol to induce inflammatory mediators in cocultures of freshly isolated monocytes with SMCs. We determined the role of interleukin-(IL)-1 in this interaction using qPCR, bioassays, ELISA and western blot. Cocultures with SMC to monocyte ratios from 1:4 to 1:20 were tested. In separate SMC and monocyte cultures (monocultures) 25-hydroxycholesterol only poorly activated IL-1, IL-6 and MCP-1 production, whereas LPS stimulated much higher cytokine levels than unstimulated cultures. In contrast, cocultures of SMCs and monocytes stimulated with 25-hydroxycholesterol produced hundredfold higher cytokine levels than the corresponding monocultures. Blocking experiments with IL-1-receptor antagonist showed that IL-1 decisively contributed to the 25-hydroxycholesterol-induced synergistic IL-6 and MCP-1 production. The presence of intracellular IL-1β precursor, released mature IL-1β, and caspase-1 p10 indicated that the inflammasome was involved in this process.

Apoptosis was examined by both flow cytometry and Western Blot. Signal transduction pathways in cells were assessed by Western Blot. Gene silencing was done by small interfering RNA (siRNA). In vivo efficacy of bortezomib was tested in nude mice with breast cancer xenografts. Immunohistochemical study was performed on tumor tissues from patients with TNBC. Bortezomib induced significant apoptosis, which was independent of its proteasome inhibition, in the three TNBC cell lines, but not in MDA-MB-453 or MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A), a cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), mediated the apoptotic effect of bortezomib. We showed that bortezomib inhibited CIP2A in association with p-Akt downregulation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in all sensitive TNBC cells, whereas no alterations in CIP2A expression and p-Akt were noted in bortezomib-resistant cells. Overexpression of CIP2A upregulated p-Akt and protected MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells from bortezomib-induced apoptosis, whereas silencing CIP2A by siRNA overcame the resistance to bortezomib-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. In addition, bortezomib downregulated CIP2A mRNA but did not affect the degradation of CIP2A protein. Furthermore, bortezomib exerted in vivo antitumor activity in HCC-1937 xenografted tumors, but not in MCF-7 tumors. Bortezomib downregulated CIP2A expression in the HCC-1937 tumors but not in the MCF-7 tumors. Importantly, CIP2A expression is readily detectable in tumor samples from TNBC patients.",Is cIP2A a target of bortezomib in human triple negative breast cancer cells?,CIP2A is a major determinant mediating bortezomib-induced apoptosis in TNBC cells.

"Anoikis resistance plays a crucial role in the promotion of survival of circulating tumor cells. This study aimed to evaluate the mechanistic pathways of anoikis resistance in human lung cancer cells and test the possible therapeutic effect of renieramycin M (RM) from the sponge Xestospongia sp. in conversion of anoikis resistance. Anoikis-resistant H460 (AR_H460) lung cancer cells in a detached condition were treated with RM at subtoxic concentrations for 24 h. Cell viability, cell morphology, and expression of the proteins involved in survival and apoptotic pathways were determined. Anoikis resistance in H460 cells is mediated through the up-regulation of survival and anti-apoptotic proteins, namely phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), phosphorylated ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (p-AKT), B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2), and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1). RM significantly reduced cell viability and inhibited spontaneous aggregation of AR_H460 cells.

"During exercise, ischemic risk increases, possibly due to changes in coagulation and fibrinolytic activity. Previous research suggests ambient temperature affects resting thrombotic potential, but the effect of heat and cold on hemostasis during exercise is unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis during maximal exercise in hot and cold temperatures, and to compare those responses to exercise under temperate conditions. Fifteen healthy men completed maximal exercise tests in hot (30°C), temperate (20°C) and cold (5° - 8°C) temperatures. Blood samples were obtained before and immediately after exercise and analyzed for concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT), active tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Results were analyzed by ANOVA. A main effect of time was observed for TAT (temperate=1.71 ± 0.82 - 2.61 ± 0.43 ng/ml, hot=1.81 ± 0.73 - 2.62 ± 0.67 ng/ml, cold=2.33 ± 0.65 - 2.89 ± 0.81 ng/ml, PRE to POST, respectively) and tPA activity (temperate=0.72 ± 0.44 - 2.71 ± 0.55 IU/ml, hot=0.72 ± 0.38 - 2.64 ± 0.61 IU/ml, cold=0.86 ± 0.45 - 2.65 ± 0.77 IU/ml, PRE to POST, respectively).

"Serum amyloid P component (SAP) is a universal constituent of amyloid deposits and contributes to their pathogenesis. SAP also has important normal functions in the handling of chromatin in vivo and resistance to bacterial infection. The atomic resolution crystal structure of SAP is known, but its physiological oligomeric assembly remains controversial. In the absence of calcium, isolated human SAP forms stable decamers composed of two cyclic disk-like pentamers interacting face to face. However, in the presence of its specific low molecular weight ligands and calcium, SAP forms stable pentamers. In the presence of calcium, but without any ligand, isolated human SAP aggressively autoaggregates and precipitates, imposing severe constraints on methods for molecular mass determination. Gel filtration chromatography and density gradient ultracentrifugation were used to compare SAP with the closely related molecule, C-reactive protein (CRP; which is known to be a single pentamer) and the effect of human serum albumin on SAP autoaggregation was investigated. In most physiological buffers and with the necessary absence of calcium, SAP, whether isolated or from whole serum samples, eluted from gel filtration columns clearly ahead of CRP. This is consistent with the existence of a monodisperse population of SAP decamers, as previously reported. However, in Tris/phosphate buffer, SAP was pentameric, suggesting that decamerization involved ionic interactions. On density gradients formed in undiluted normal human serum, SAP sedimented as single pentamers not complexed with any macromolecular ligand, regardless of the presence or absence of calcium. The calcium-dependent autoaggregation of isolated SAP was completely inhibited by physiological concentrations of albumin and the SAP remained pentameric.",Is human serum amyloid P component a single uncomplexed pentamer in whole serum?,"Human SAP exists within serum as single uncomplexed pentamers in the presence or absence of calcium.

"Infliximab is effective treatment for Crohn's disease and has been associated with rare, but serious infectious complications. Emerging data suggest a benefit of infliximab in preventing postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence. It is not known whether administration of infliximab shortly after resective surgery for Crohn's disease increases postoperative complications. To evaluate the risk of developing postoperative complications among Crohn's disease patients receiving infliximab within 4 weeks of intestinal resection. As part of a randomized placebo-controlled infliximab postoperative prevention study, adverse events were prospectively monitored. Crohn's disease patients undergoing intestinal resection were randomized to placebo or infliximab 2-4 weeks after surgery. Study infusions were administered at 0, 2, and 6 weeks then every 8 weeks for 1 year. To evaluate whether infliximab increased postoperative complications, we analyzed all adverse events for 1 year after surgery. Twenty-four patients were randomized to infliximab or placebo after intestinal resection for Crohn's disease. Mean time to first postoperative infusion was 20 days (range 14-25 days). Over the course of 1 year, there were 22 total adverse events, but no difference between infliximab and placebo patients (12 versus 10, respectively, P = 1.0). In the immediate postoperative period, within 8 weeks of surgery, the number of adverse events was also similar between the two groups (3 infliximab and 5 placebo patients, P = 0.68).

"Tongxinluo (TXL), a compound prescription, is formulated according to the collateral disease doctrine of traditional Chinese medicine, and is widely used for the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases in China. We aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of TXL on focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats by attenuating its brain damage and neuronal apoptosis, and to assess the potential role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway in this protection. Adult Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=120) were randomly divided into 5 groups: sham, cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), cerebral ischemia and reperfusion plus TXL (1.6g/kg/day) (TXL1.6), TXL1.6 plus LY294002 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (TXL1.6+LY294002), TXL1.6 plus DMSO (TXL1.6+vehicle). Prior to the grouping, TXL1.6 was selected to be the optimal dose of TXL by evaluating the neurological deficits score of five group rats (Sham, I/R, TXL0.4, TXL0.8 and TXL1.6, n=30) at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after reperfusion. Rats, being subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90min followed by 24h reperfusion, were the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion models. At 24h after reperfusion, cerebral infarct area was measured via tetrazolium staining and neuronal damage was showed by Nissl staining. The double staining of Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and immunofluorescence labeling with NeuN, was performed to evaluate neuronal apoptosis. Proteins involved in PI3K/Akt pathway were detected by Western blot. The results showed that TXL markedly improved neurological function, reduced cerebral infarct area, decreased neuronal damage, and significantly attenuated neuronal apoptosis, while these effects were eliminated by inhibition of PI3K/Akt with LY294002. We also found that TXL up-regulated the expression levels of p-PDK1, p-Akt, p-c-Raf, p-BAD and down-regulated Cleaved caspase 3 expression notably, which were partially reversed by LY294002. Additionally, the increment of p-PTEN level on which LY294002 had little effect was also detected in response to TXL treatment.",Does pI3K/Akt pathway contribute to neuroprotective effect of Tongxinluo against focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats?,"These findings demonstrated that TXL provided neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and neuronal apoptosis, and this effect was mediated partly by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.",0,1.

"The identification and characterization of several interferon (IFN)-induced cellular HIV-1 restriction factors, defined as host cellular proteins or factors that restrict or inhibit the HIV-1 life cycle, have provided insight into the IFN response towards HIV-1 infection and identified new therapeutic targets for HIV-1 infection. To further characterize the mechanism underlying restriction of the late stages of HIV-1 replication, we assessed the ability of IFNbeta-induced genes to restrict HIV-1 Gag particle production and have identified a potentially novel host factor called HECT domain and RCC1-like domain-containing protein 5 (HERC5) that blocks a unique late stage of the HIV-1 life cycle. HERC5 inhibited the replication of HIV-1 over multiple rounds of infection and was found to target a late stage of HIV-1 particle production. The E3 ligase activity of HERC5 was required for blocking HIV-1 Gag particle production and correlated with the post-translational modification of Gag with ISG15. HERC5 interacted with HIV-1 Gag and did not alter trafficking of HIV-1 Gag to the plasma membrane. Electron microscopy revealed that the assembly of HIV-1 Gag particles was arrested at the plasma membrane, at an early stage of assembly. The mechanism of HERC5-induced restriction of HIV-1 particle production is distinct from the mechanism underlying HIV-1 restriction by the expression of ISG15 alone, which acts at a later step in particle release. Moreover, HERC5 restricted murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag particle production, showing that HERC5 is effective in restricting Gag particle production of an evolutionarily divergent retrovirus.",Does human HERC5 restrict an early stage of HIV-1 assembly by a mechanism correlating with the ISGylation of Gag?,"HERC5 represents a potential new host factor that blocks an early stage of retroviral Gag particle assembly.

"Increased reactive microglia are a histological characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD) brains, positively correlating with levels of deposited α-synuclein protein. This suggests that microglial-mediated inflammatory events may contribute to disease pathophysiology. Mutations in the gene coding for α-synuclein lead to a familial form of PD. Based upon our prior findings that α-synuclein expression regulates microglial phenotype we hypothesized that expression of mutant forms of the protein may contribute to the reactive microgliosis characteristic of PD brains. To quantify the effects of wild type and mutant α-synuclein over-expression on microglial phenotype a murine microglial cell line, BV2, was transiently transfected to express human wild type (WT), and mutant α-synuclein (A30P and A53T) proteins. Transfected cells were used to assess changes in microglia phenotype via Western blot analysis, ELISA, phagocytosis, and neurotoxicity assays. As expected, over-expression of α-synuclein induced a reactive phenotype in the transfected cells. Expression of α-synuclein increased protein levels of cycloxygenase-2 (Cox-2). Transfected cells demonstrated increased secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as increased nitric oxide production. Transfected cells also had impaired phagocytic ability correlating with decreased protein levels of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1).

"Interaction between different members of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily and their receptors elicits diverse biologic actions that are implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We have analyzed the expression of Fn14 and its ligand TWEAK in carotid atherosclerotic plaques and its potential modulation by atorvastatin in vivo. Furthermore, we have studied whether proinflammatory cytokines regulate Fn14 expression in human aortic smooth muscle cells (hASMCs) in culture as well as the potential regulation by atorvastatin treatment. Fn14 and TWEAK expression was analyzed in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Furthermore, Fn14 expression was studied in hASMCs in culture. Fn14 and TWEAK are expressed in macrophages and smooth muscle cells in carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma) upregulate Fn14 expression in hASMCs. This effect was prevented by atorvastatin treatment and reversed by mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, toxin B (Rac and Rho inhibitor), C3 exoenzyme (Rho inhibitor), and Y-27632 (Rho kinase inhibitor) also decreased Fn14 expression, implicating the Rho/Rho kinase pathway in the regulation of Fn14 expression.

"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved treatment for epilepsy and has been investigated in clinical trials of depression. Little is known about the relationship of VNS parameters to brain function. Using the interleaved VNS /functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique, we tested whether variations of VNS pulse width (PW) would produce different immediate brain activation in a manner consistent with single neuron PW studies. Twelve adult patients with major depression, treated with VNS, underwent three consecutive VNS/fMRI scans, each randomly using one of three PWs (130 micros, 250 micros, or 500 micros). The data were analyzed with SPM2. Global activations induced by PWs 250 and 500 were both significantly greater than that induced by PW 130 but not significantly different from each other.

"Mitochondria are critical to cardiac injury during reperfusion as a result of damage sustained during ischemia, including the loss of bcl-2. We asked if bcl-2 depletion not only leads to selective permeation of the outer mitochondrial membrane (MOMP) favoring cytochrome c release and programmed cell death, but also favors opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). An increase in MPTP susceptibility would support a role for bcl-2 depletion mediated cell death in the calcium overload setting of early reperfusion via MPTP as well as later in reperfusion via MOMP as myocardial calcium content normalizes. Calcium retention capacity (CRC) was used to reflect the sensitivity of the MPTP opening in isolated cardiac mitochondria. To study the relationship between bcl-2 inhibition and MPTP opening, mitochondria were incubated with a bcl-2 inhibitor (HA14-1) and CRC measured. The contribution of preserved bcl-2 content to MPTP opening following ischemia-reperfusion was explored using transgenic bcl-2 overexpressed mice. CRC was decreased in mitochondria following reperfusion compared to ischemia alone, indicating that reperfusion further sensitizes to MPTP opening. Incubation of ischemia-damaged mitochondria with increasing HA14-1concentrations increased calcium-stimulated MPTP opening, supporting that functional inhibition of bcl-2 during simulated reperfusion favors MPTP opening. Moreover, HA14-1 sensitivity was increased by ischemia compared to non-ischemic controls. Overexpression of bcl-2 attenuated MPTP opening in following ischemia-reperfusion. HA14-1 inhibition also increased the permeability of the outer membrane in the absence of exogenous calcium, indicating that bcl-2 inhibition favors MOMP when calcium is low.",Does inhibition of Bcl-2 sensitize mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( MPTP ) opening in ischemia-damaged mitochondria?,"The depletion and functional inhibition of bcl-2 contributes to cardiac injury by increasing susceptibility to MPTP opening in high calcium environments and MOMP in the absence of calcium overload.

"There is increasing evidence that the Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) system is involved in tumor-mediated immune suppression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Fas (CD95) as well as FasL (CD95L) expression in primary malignant melanoma and melanoma metastases on overall survival (OS). 19 patients with metastatic malignant melanoma who were treated with different dacarbazine (DTIC)-based chemotherapy regimens were included in this study. From each patient, primary melanoma biopsies and biopsies from metastases were histologically evaluated. Immunohistology was performed with antibodies to Fas/CD95 and FasL/CD95L. Differences in OS were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log rank test. Fas/CD95 and FasL/CD95L expression was detected in 73.7 and 63.2% of primary melanomas, respectively. In metastases, expression of both Fas/CD95 (63.2%) and FasL/CD95L (47.4%) was markedly decreased. Presence of FasL/ CD95L expression in primary melanoma resulted in significantly (p = 0.024) prolonged OS compared with FasL/CD95L-negative high-risk primary melanomas.

"The F11 Receptor (F11R; aka JAM-A, JAM-1) is a cell adhesion protein present constitutively on the membrane surface of circulating platelets and within tight junctions of endothelial cells (ECs). Previous reports demonstrated that exposure of ECs to pro-inflammatory cytokines causes insertion of F11R molecules into the luminal surface of ECs, ensuing with homologous interactions between F11R molecules of platelets and ECs, and a resultant adhesion of platelets to the inflamed ECs. The main new finding of the present report is that the first step in this chain of events is the de-novo transcription and translation of F11R molecules, induced in ECs by exposure to inflammatory cytokines. The experimental approach utilized isolated, washed human platelet suspensions and cultured human venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human arterial endothelial cells (HAEC) exposed to the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma, for examination of the ability of human platelets to adhere to the inflamed ECs thru the F11R. Our strategy was based on testing the effects of the following inhibitors on this activity: general mRNA synthesis inhibitors, inhibitors of the NF-kappaB and JAK/STAT pathways, and small interfering F11R-mRNA (siRNAs) to specifically silence the F11R gene. Treatment of inflamed ECs with the inhibitors actinomycin, parthenolide or with AG-480 resulted in complete blockade of F11R- mRNA expression, indicating the involvement of NF-kappaB and JAK/STAT pathways in this induction. Transfection of ECs with F11R siRNAs caused complete inhibition of the cytokine-induced upregulation of F11R mRNA and inhibition of detection of the newly- translated F11R molecules in cytokine-inflamed ECs.

"We sought to test whether a transient myocardial ischaemia can induce impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and whether sevoflurane preconditioning can provide robust protective effects on this neurological impairment. Wistar rats were subjected to a transient coronary artery occlusion for 30 min. Sevoflurane preconditioning was performed by exposure to 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane for 1 h and washout for 30 min before myocardial ischaemia. Hippocampal LTP was evaluated during a 7-day observation period. The expressions of haem oxygenase-1 mRNA, tumour necrosis factor-alpha mRNA and interleukin-1beta mRNA in the hippocampus were analysed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. LTP was significantly inhibited 1 and 3 days after the transient myocardial ischaemia in the control group when compared with the animals subjected to a sham operation without coronary occlusion, and the LTP recovered to a normal magnitude 7 days later. Sevoflurane preconditioning remarkably reversed the transient inhibition of LTP observed at 1 and 3 days after myocardial ischaemia.

"The impact of interleukin (IL)-6 on skeletal muscle function remains the subject of controversy. The effects of 7-day subcutaneous administration of recombinant human IL-6 were examined at 3 doses, 50, 100, or 250 microg x kg(-1) x d(-1), in rats. Skeletal muscle mass decreased dose-dependently (with increasing dose: in the diaphragm, -10%, P=NS; -15%, P=0.0561; and -15% P<0.05; and in the gastrocnemius, -9%, P=NS; -9%, P=NS; and -18%, P<0.005) because of decreases in cross-sectional area of all fiber types without alterations in diaphragm contractile properties. Cardiovascular variables showed a dose-dependent heart dilatation (for end-diastolic volume: control, 78 microL; moderate dose, 123 microL; and high dose, 137 microL, P<0.001), reduced end-systolic pressure (control, 113 mm Hg; moderate dose, 87 mm Hg; and high dose, 90 mm Hg; P=0.037), and decreased myocardial contractility (for preload recruitable stroke work: control, 79 mm Hg; moderate dose, 67 mm Hg; and high dose, 48 mm Hg; P<0.001).

"AJCC staging system is unreliable for predicting survival in distal bile duct (DBD) cancer patients, due to inter-observer variation. Measured depth of invasion (DOI) is suggested to be more accurate to predict patients' clinical outcome in extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas, but its significance in DBD cancer and cutoff values are still debatable. This study aimed to identify the optimal cutoff value of DOI in relation to prognosis in DBD cancer patients. Data of 179 patients with DBD adenocarcinoma treated in three institutions were investigated. Under microscopic review, DOI was measured. The relationships between the clinicopathological parameters and the groups based on DOI (≤3; 3-10; >10 mm) were evaluated, and the survival times of each group based on DOI and T classification were compared. Deeply invading tumors exhibited a greater tendency toward the infiltrative type, high histological grade, AJCC stage, and pancreatic, duodenal, lymphovascular and perineural invasion. The measured DOI was significantly correlated with worse relapse-free and overall survival (all p < 0.05). In multivariate analyses, the DOI remained as one of the prognostic factors (all p < 0.05), while T classification was not a significant prognostic factor.

"RANKL is known to be important not only for differentiation and activation of osteoclasts but also for their survival. Experimentally, apoptosis of osteoclasts is rapidly induced by the deprivation of RANKL. RANKL activates Elk-related tyrosine kinase (ERK), p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and NF-kappaB pathways through TRAF6 in osteoclasts and the precursor cells. It has been shown that ERK is critical for regulation of osteoclast survival. However, an involvement of other RANKL signaling pathways such as JNK signaling in survival of osteoclasts has not been fully understood yet. Osteoclasts derived from primary mouse bone marrow cells by soluble RANKL (sRANKL) were treated with a JNK inhibitor, SP600125, or infected with adenovirus carrying dominant-negative (DN)-c-jun, DN-c-fos, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), I-kappaBalpha mutant, or NF-kappaB components, p50 and p65. Osteoclasts were cultured with or without sRANKL, and apoptotic phenotype was determined by TUNEL assay, DAPI staining, and expression of cleaved caspase 3 followed by TRACP staining. Overexpression of TRAF6 activated JNK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways and clearly prevented osteoclasts from apoptosis caused by abrogation of sRANKL. An anti-apoptotic effect of RANKL/RANK/TRAF6 signaling on osteoclast was inhibited by JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 and by overexpression of dominant-negative JNK1, c-jun, and c-fos. Also, overexpression of MEKK1 inhibited apoptosis of osteoclasts even in the absence of sRANKL along with activation of JNK/c-jun signaling. On the other hand, blockade of NF-kappaB signaling by I-kappaBalpha mutant or overexpression of NF-kappaB components showed a marginal effect on apoptosis of osteoclasts.",Does jNK/c-Jun signaling mediate an anti-apoptotic effect of RANKL in osteoclasts?,"An important role of RANKL-induced activation of MEKK1/JNK/c-jun signaling in the regulation of apoptosis in osteoclasts was shown.

"To investigate the effects Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced inflammatory reactions in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. HUVECs were treated with TNF-α for 24 h. The amounts of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) were determined with Western blotting. HUVEC viability and apoptosis were detected using cell viability assay and Hoechst staining, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured by DHE staining. Monocyte and HUVEC adhesion assay was used to detect endothelial cell adhesive function. NF-κB activation was detected with immunofluorescence. TNF-α (1-80 ng/mL) caused dose- and time-dependent increases of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in HUVECs, accompanied by significant augmentation of IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB translocation into the nuclei.

"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) versus HIV on mitochondria in fat. Subcutaneous fat was collected from 45 HIV-infected patients on ART with lipoatrophy, 11 HIV-infected ART-naive patients and nine healthy controls. Three mitochondrial transcripts: NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1), cytochrome B (CYTB) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6) genes were quantitated using TaqMan probes and normalized to nuclear-encoded ribosomal L13. ND1/L13 and CYTB/L13 were lower in HIV-positive patients on ART with lipoatrophy versus ART-naive patients (3.4 versus 7.2 [P=0.017] and 2.5 versus 4.6 [P=0.006], respectively). No difference was found between ART-naive patients and controls (P>0.70). ND6/L13 was similar between all groups.

"The objective of this study was to address the hepatic effects of acute alcohol consumption in obesity by simulating an alcohol binge in genetically obese fa/fa rats compared with lean Fa/? rats. Ethanol 4 g/kg or saline was administered by gavage every 12 hours for 3 days. Plasma alcohol levels were similar in both groups. Binge ethanol exposure caused liver injury in obese fa/fa but not in lean Fa/? rats, as assessed by alanine aminotransferase and H&E staining. Obesity impaired the antioxidant defense because basal levels of glutathione, glutamate cysteine ligase modulatory subunit, catalase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase were lower in fa/fa compared with Fa/? rats; the ethanol binge further decreased these antioxidants in fa/fa rats and also decreased glutathione peroxidase activity. Nonesterified fatty acids and lipid peroxidation were increased after ethanol treatment in fa/fa rats. Cytochrome P450 2E1 was down-regulated in fa/fa compared with Fa/? rats; however, the ethanol binge increased cytochrome P450 2E1 in both genotypes. Adenosine triphosphate decreased and uncoupling protein 2 increased in fa/fa rats treated with ethanol. 3-Nitrotyrosine protein adducts were detected only in fa/fa rats treated with ethanol, and this was accompanied by an induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase.

"After coronary microembolization (ME) adenosine is released from ischemic areas of the microembolized myocardium. This adenosine dilates vessels in adjacent nonembolized myocardium and increases coronary blood flow. For ischemic preconditioning (IP) to protect the myocardium against infarction, an increase in the interstitial adenosine concentration (iADO) prior to the subsequent ischemia/reperfusion is necessary. We hypothesized that the adenosine release after ME is sufficient to increase iADO and protect the myocardium against infarction from subsequent ischemia/reperfusion. We have therefore compared myocardial protection by either coronary microembolization or ischemic preconditioning prior to ischemia/reperfusion. In anesthetized pigs, the left anterior descending (LAD) was cannulated and perfused from an extracorporeal circuit. In 11 pigs, sustained ischemia was induced by 85% inflow reduction for 90 min (controls). Two other groups of pigs were subjected either to IP (n = 8; 10-min ischemia/15-min reperfusion) or coronary ME (n = 9; i.c. microspheres; 42 microm Ø; 3000 x ml(-1) x min inflow) prior to sustained ischemia. Coronary venous adenosine concentration (vADO) and iADO (microdialysis) were measured. Infarct size was determined after 2-h reperfusion by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. In pigs subjected to IP, infarct size was reduced to 2.6 +/- 1.1% (mean +/- S.E.M.) vs. 17.0 +/- 3.2% in controls. iADO was increased from 2.4 +/- 1.3 to 13.1 +/- 5.8 micromol x l(-1) during the reperfusion following IP. In pigs subjected to ME, at 10 min after ME, coronary blood flow (38.6 +/- 3.6 to 53.6 +/- 4.3 ml x min(-1)) and vADO (0.25 +/- 0.04 to 0.48 +/- 0.07 micromol x l(-1)) were increased. However, iADO (2.0 +/- 0.5 at baseline vs. 2.3 +/- 0.6 micromol x l(-1) at 10 min after ME) did not increase.

"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the most frequently inactivated tumor suppressor genes in sporadic cancers. Somatic mutations of PTEN occur in many tumors including those of the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary tracts. Loss of PTEN expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma, gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. To study the expression of PTEN and its significance in ampullary adenocarcinoma (AA). We constructed tissue microarrays by using archival tissue from 92 patients (55 males, 37 females; median age, 63 years; age range, 37 to 87 years) with previously untreated AA who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at our institution. PTEN expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, scored semiquantitatively (based on staining intensity and percentage positive tumor cells), and correlated with clinicopathologic features and survival. Of 92 cases, 23 (25.0%) were PTEN negative. Loss of PTEN expression correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = .004), advanced American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (P = .02), and higher frequency of recurrence (P = .03). Patients with PTEN-negative tumors had shorter disease-free survival (DFS, mean: 89.0 ± 20.8 months) and overall survival (OS, mean: 93.1 ± 19.1 months) than those with PTEN-positive tumors (DFS, mean: 161.4 ± 11.7 months, P = .01; OS, mean: 175.4 ± 11.0 months, P = .001).

"Social recognition underlies social behavior in animals, and patients with psychiatric disorders associated with social deficits show abnormalities in social recognition. Oxytocin is implicated in social behavior and has received attention as an effective treatment for sociobehavioral deficits. Secretin receptor-deficient mice show deficits in social behavior. The relationship between oxytocin and secretin concerning social behavior remains to be determined. Expression of c-Fos in oxytocin neurons and release of oxytocin from their dendrites after secretin application were investigated. Social recognition was examined after intracerebroventricular or local injection of secretin, oxytocin, or an oxytocin receptor antagonist in rats, oxytocin receptor-deficient mice, and secretin receptor-deficient mice. Electron and light microscopic immunohistochemical analysis was also performed to determine whether oxytocin neurons extend their dendrites into the medial amygdala. Supraoptic oxytocin neurons expressed the secretin receptor. Secretin activated supraoptic oxytocin neurons and facilitated oxytocin release from dendrites. Secretin increased acquisition of social recognition in an oxytocin receptor-dependent manner. Local application of secretin into the supraoptic nucleus facilitated social recognition, and this facilitation was blocked by an oxytocin receptor antagonist injected into, but not outside of, the medial amygdala. In the medial amygdala, dendrite-like thick oxytocin processes were found to extend from the supraoptic nucleus.

"The neuroendocrine response to hemorrhage is to maintain perfusion to the heart and brain, often at the expense of other organ systems. Systemic inflammation and tissue injury are important components of pathophysiologic consequences of hemorrhage. We have recently shown that administration of adrenomedullin (AM, a potent vasodilator peptide) and adrenomedullin binding protein-1 (AMBP-1) prevented the transition from the hyperdynamic to the hypodynamic stage in the progression of sepsis. However, the effect of AM/AMBP-1 on the inflammatory response after hemorrhage remains unknown. We therefore hypothesized that administration of AM/AMBP-1 during fluid resuscitation in hemorrhaged animals (i.e., posttreatment) attenuates tissue injury and the proinflammatory response. Prospective, controlled, and randomized animal study. A research institute laboratory. Male adult rats. Rats were bled, and then a mean arterial pressure was maintained at 40 mm Hg for 90 mins. They were then resuscitated by infusion of four times the volume of shed blood using Ringer's lactate solution for 60 mins. Fifteen minutes after the beginning of resuscitation, AM (12 microg/kg of body weight) in combination with AMBP-1 (40 microg/kg of body weight) was administered via a femoral venous catheter for 45 mins. Blood samples were collected 4 hrs postresuscitation and assayed for levels of liver enzymes (i.e., alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase), lactate, creatinine, proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor and high mobility group box 1, and anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10. The results indicate that levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, lactate, tumor necrosis factor, and high mobility group box 1 markedly elevated after hemorrhage and resuscitation, and AM/AMBP-1 treatment significantly attenuated these increases. In contrast, the serum concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 was increased by the treatment of AM/AMBP-1.

"B-cell lymphomas frequently contain genomic rearrangements that lead to oncogene activation by heterologous distal regulatory elements. We used a novel approach called ""pinpointing enhancer-associated rearrangements by chromatin immunoprecipitation,"" or PEAR-ChIP, to simultaneously map enhancer activity and proximal rearrangements in lymphoma cell lines and patient biopsies. This method detects rearrangements involving known cancer genes, including CCND1, BCL2, MYC, PDCD1LG2, NOTCH1, CIITA, and SGK1, as well as novel enhancer duplication events of likely oncogenic significance. We identify lymphoma subtype-specific enhancers in the MYC locus that are silenced in lymphomas with MYC-activating rearrangements and are associated with germline polymorphisms that alter lymphoma risk. We show that BCL6-locus enhancers are acetylated by the BCL6-activating transcription factor MEF2B, and can undergo genomic duplication, or target the MYC promoter for activation in the context of a ""pseudo-double-hit"" t(3;8)(q27;q24) rearrangement linking the BCL6 and MYC loci.

"37 million individuals are currently infected with Onchocerca volvulus (O. volvulus), a parasitic nematode that elicits various dermal manifestations and eye damage in man. Disease control is primarily based on distributing ivermectin in mass drug administration (MDA) programmes which aim at breaking transmission by eliminating microfilariae (MF), the worm's offspring. The majority of infected individuals present generalized onchocerciasis, which is characterized by hyporesponsive immune responses and high parasite burden including MF. Recently, in areas that have been part of MDA programmes, individuals have been identified that present nodules but are amicrofilaridermic (a-MF) and our previous study showed that this group has a distinct immune profile. Expanding on those findings we determined the immune responses of O. volvulus-infected individuals to a Plasmodium-derived antigen MSP-1 (merozoite surface protein-1), which is required by the parasite to enter erythrocytes. Isolated PBMCs from O. volvulus-infected individuals (164 MF(+) and 46 a-MF) and non-infected volunteers from the same region (NEN), were stimulated with MSP-1 and the resulting supernatant screened for the presence of IL-5, IL-13, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17A and IL-10. These findings were then further analyzed following regression analysis using the covariates MF, ivermectin (IVM) and region. The latter referred to the Central or Ashanti regions of Ghana, which, at the time sampling, had received 8 or 1 round of MDA respectively. IL-5, IL-13 and IFN-γ responses to MSP-1 were not altered between NEN and O. volvulus-infected individuals nor were any associations revealed in the regression analysis. IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-α MSP-1 responses were, however, significantly elevated in cultures from infected individuals. Interestingly, when compared to a-MF individuals, MSP-induced IL-17A responses were significantly higher in MF(+) patients.

"Periods of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) during cardiac surgery are associated with transient left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and an inflammatory response. In this study, we examined the potential dose-dependent effects of aprotinin (APRO) on LV contractility and cytokine release in the setting of I/R. An index of LV contractility, LV maximal elastance (E(max)), was measured at baseline, 30 min of ischemia, and 60 min of reperfusion by microtransducer volumetry. Mice were randomized as follows: (a) APRO 20,000 kallikrein-inhibiting units (KIU)/kg (n = 11); (b) APRO 4 x 10(4) KIU/kg (n = 10); (c) APRO 8 x 10(4) KIU/kg (n = 10); and (d) vehicle (saline; n = 10). APRO doses were calculated to reflect half, full, and twice the clinical Hammersmith dosing schedule. After I/R, plasma was collected for cytokine measurements. After I/R, E(max) decreased from the baseline value by more than 40% in the vehicle group as well as in the APRO 4 x 10(4) KIU/kg and APRO 8 x 10(4) KIU/kg groups (P < 0.05). However, E(max) returned to near baseline values in the APRO 2 x 10(4) KIU/kg group.

"Obesity-associated hypertension is likely to be due to multiple mechanisms. Identification of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) within adipose tissue does, however, suggest a potential causal role for it in obesity-associated hypertension. Obese patients are often hyperinsulinemic, but mechanisms underlying insulin upregulation of the RAS in adipose tissue are unclear. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), an inducer of angiotensinogen in hepatocytes, is elevated in hyperinsulinemic, obese individuals and may provide a link in mediating insulin upregulation of the RAS in adipose tissue. Furthermore, thiazolidinediones lower blood pressure in vivo, and downregulation of the RAS in adipose tissue may contribute to this effect. We therefore examined the effect of rosiglitazone (RSG) on the insulin-mediated upregulation of the RAS. Sera were obtained from the arterial circulation and from venous blood by draining subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue. Isolated human abdominal subcutaneous adipocytes (n=12) were treated with insulin (1 to 1000 nmol/L), insulin in combination with RSG (10 nmol/L), and RSG (10 nmol/L) alone to determine angiotensinogen expression and angiotensin II, bradykinin, and TNF-alpha secretion. Subcutaneous adipocytes were also treated with TNF-alpha (10 to 100 ng/mL) to examine the direct effect on angiotensinogen expression and angiotensin II secretion. The findings showed that the arteriovenous difference in angiotensin II levels was significant (>23%; P<0.001). Insulin increased TNF-alpha secretion in a concentration-dependent manner (P<0.01), whereas RSG (10 nmol/L) significantly reduced the insulin-mediated rise in TNF-alpha (P<0.001), as well as angiotensin and angiotensin II. TNF-alpha also increased angiotensinogen and angiotensin II in isolated adipocytes.",Is insulin-mediated upregulation of the renin angiotensin system in human subcutaneous adipocytes reduced by rosiglitazone?,"The present in vivo data suggest that human subcutaneous adipose tissue is a significant source of angiotensin II.

"Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 2 (HSAN2; MIM 201300) is a rare recessive neuropathy typically diagnosed in the first decade. The 1973 study of a French Canadian family led to the definition of HSAN2. To demonstrate that the apparent higher prevalence of HSAN2 in Quebec is due to the presence of two HSN2 mutations and that carriers of different mutations appear to have a similar phenotype. Through attending physicians, the authors recruited French Canadian patients with HSAN2. Exclusion of linkage to the known HSAN loci and linkage to the HSAN2 was performed using standard methods. Sequencing of the HSN2 gene was used to uncover the causal mutations. A large cluster of HSAN2 patients comprising 16 affected individuals belonging to 13 families was identified. The mode of inheritance is clearly autosomal recessive. All patients originated from southern Quebec, and 75% are from the Lanaudière region. Whereas linkage to the HSAN1, 3, and 4 loci was excluded, linkage to the 12p13.33 HSAN2 locus was confirmed. Sequencing of the HSN2 gene uncovered two French Canadian mutations and a novel nonsense mutation in a patient of Lebanese origin, all predicted to lead to truncations of the HSN2 protein.

"The antagonism of Agouti protein (AP) and Agouti-related protein on melanocortin receptors suggests an inhibitory role in the regulation of steroidogenesis. However, we have previously demonstrated that ectopic AP overexpression increased restraint-induced corticosterone release and adrenal reactivity to ACTH in mice. A high steroidogenic response to ACTH may be a consequence of a stimulatory AP action on the adenylate cyclase (AC) and/or intracellular steroidogenic enzymes. The aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of ectopic AP overexpression on the activity of AC and steroidogenic intracellular enzymes. ACTH and forskolin were used for AC stimulation, and dibutyryl cAMP and progesterone were used for stimulation of intracellular steroidogenic enzymes in isolated adrenal cells in male C57Bl/6J mice of two Agouti genotypes: A(y)/a (ectopic AP overexpression) and a/a (absence of AP in all tissues). ACTH and forskolin increased cAMP accumulation to the same extent in both A(y)/a and a/a mouse adrenal cells (P<0.001; ANOVA), but resulted in higher corticosterone production in A(y)/a mice (P<0.001 for ACTH and P<0.01 for forskolin; ANOVA). Dibutyryl cAMP- and progesterone-induced corticosterone production was higher in A(y)/a mice than in a/a mice (P<0.001 for dibutyryl cAMP and P<0.01 for progesterone; ANOVA).",Does ectopic Agouti protein overexpression increase stimulated corticosterone production without effect on adenylate cyclase activity in mouse adrenal cells?,Ectopic AP overexpression increased stimulated corticosterone production and intracellular steroidogenic enzyme reactivity to cAMP without an effect on AC activity.,0,"1.

"Interferon-induced depression is a major complication in antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis C. Little is known about underlying mechanisms and reliable predictive factors associated with cytokine-induced depressive symptoms. In a cohort of 139 hepatitis C-infected outpatients treated with interferon alfa-2b, we investigated the impact of functional gene variants of the cerebral serotonin (5-HT) signalling pathway previously implicated in depression risk. Depression was monitored using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). All patients were genotyped for functional variations in the 5-HT(1A) receptor (HTR1A), 5-HT transporter (SLC6A4, 5-HTT), and tryptophan hydoxylase-2 (TPH2). Homozygosity for the HTR1A-1019G variant significantly increased both incidence and severity of interferon-induced depression. Maximum increases in HADS depression scores during antiviral therapy correlated with HTR1A variation (P = .011). Clinically relevant depression was significantly associated with the HTR1A-1019G genotype (P = .017; OR, 2.95). 5-HTT and TPH2 variations did not contribute significantly to the prediction of interferon-induced depression by HTR1A (sensitivity, 35.9%; specificity, 84.0%).",Does serotonin-1A receptor gene HTR1A variation predict interferon-induced depression in chronic hepatitis C?,Our findings suggest an impact of allelic variation in 5-HT(1A) receptor expression on the development of interferon alfa-induced depression during antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis C.

"We previously detected CXCR4 expression in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) tissues and demonstrated CXCR4-enhanced proliferation of PanIN cells. Our objective was to determine if the CXCR4 targets AKT and ERK mediate CXCR4-dependent PanIN and pancreatic cancer proliferation. We exposed cultured murine-derived PanIN, invasive pancreatic cancer (5143PDA) and liver metastasis (5143LM) cells, and human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells to CXCL12, the specific CXCR4 ligand, and measured phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2. The roles of AKT and ERK1/2 in CXCR4-dependent cell proliferation were assessed by the PI/3K-AKT small molecular inhibitor LY294002 and the ERK signaling inhibitor UO126. We discovered increases in phosphorylation of AKT in PanIN, 5143PDA, and PANC-1 cells but no increase in 5143LM cells after exposure to CXCL12. We also observed that exposure to CXCL12 over varying periods phosphorylated ERK1/2 in an oscillatory pattern for all cell lines. Administration of LY294002 resulted in complete abrogation of CXCL12-induced proliferation in PanIN, 5143LM, and PANC-1 cells but not 5143PDA cells, whereas UO126 resulted in complete abrogation of CXCR4-enhanced proliferation in all cell lines.",Does chemokine receptor CXCR4 enhance proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells through AKT and ERK dependent pathways?,Our studies show that CXCR4-induced proliferation is mediated by both AKT and ERK signaling in both murine and human pancreatic cancer cells.,0,1.

"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inborn error of metabolism often complicated by a progressive bone impairment of uncertain etiology, as documented by both ionizing and non- ionizing techniques. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures were performed to study osteoclastogenesis, in the presence or absence of recombinant human monocyte-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL). Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze osteoclast precursors (OCPs) and T cell phenotype. Tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), RANKL and osteoprotegerin (OPG) were quantified in cell culture supernatants by ELISA. The effects of RANKFc and anti-TNF-α antibodies were also investigated to determine their ability to inhibit osteoclastogenesis. In addition, bone conditions and phenylalanine levels in PKU patients were clinically evaluated. Several in vitro studies in PKU patients' cells identified a potential mechanism of bone formation inhibition commonly associated with this disorder. First, PKU patients disclosed an increased osteoclastogenesis compared to healthy controls, both in unstimulated and M-CSF/RANKL stimulated PBMC cultures. OCPs and the measured RANKL/OPG ratio were higher in PKU patients compared to healthy controls. The addition of specific antagonist RANKFc caused osteoclastogenesis inhibition, whereas anti-TNF-α failed to have this effect. Among PBMCs isolated from PKU patients, activated T cells, expressing CD69, CD25 and RANKL were identified. Confirmatory in vivo studies support this proposed model.

"Cell cycle progression is governed by the coordinated activities of kinases, phosphatases, and the ubiquitin system. The entire complement of ubiquitin pathway components that mediate this process in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells remains to be identified. This study was undertaken to determine whether the human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UBE2E3, is essential for RPE cell proliferation. UBE2E3 expression and localization in telomerase-immortalized, human RPE cells was determined with a UBE2E3-specific antibody. The necessity for UBE2E3 in RPE proliferation was determined using small interfering (si)RNA to target the expression of the enzyme. Cell counts and immunolabeling for the proliferation marker Ki-67 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) were performed to assess the consequences of UBE2E3 depletion. A mouse strain harboring a disrupted allele of UbcM2 (the mouse counterpart of UBE2E3) with the coding sequence for beta-galactosidase was used to track the developmental expression of the enzyme in murine RPE cells. UBE2E3 localized in the nucleus of the immortalized RPE cells. Depletion of the enzyme by siRNA resulted in a cell-cycle exit accompanied by a loss of Ki-67, an increase in p27(Kip1), and a doubling in cell area. Rescue experiments confirmed the specificity of the RNA interference.

"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder with a broad array of clinical manifestations, including benign and malignant tumors, and characteristic cutaneous findings. NF1 patients also have an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including obstructive vascular disorders and hypertension.

"This study aimed to evaluate prospectively the influence and the evolution of periodontal disease (PD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients submitted to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Eighteen patients with RA (according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria) were assessed for PD before (BL) and after 6 months (6M) of anti-TNF treatment: 15 infliximab, 2 adalimumab, and 1 etanercept. Periodontal assessment included plaque and gingival bleeding indices, probing pocket depth, cementoenamel junction, and clinical attachment level. Rheumatologic evaluation was performed blinded to the dentist's assessment: demographic data, clinical manifestations, and disease activity (Disease Activity Score using 28 joints [DAS28], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], and C-reactive protein [CRP]). The median age and disease duration of patients with RA were 50 years (25-71 y) and 94% were female. Periodontal disease was diagnosed in 8 patients (44.4%). Comparing BL to 6M, periodontal parameters in the entire group remained stable (P > 0.05) throughout the study (plaque and gingival bleeding indices, probing pocket depth, cementoenamel junction, and clinical attachment level), whereas an improvement in most analyzed RA parameters was observed in the same period: DAS28 (5.5 vs. 3.9, P = 0.02), ESR (21 vs. 12.5 mm/first hour, P = 0.07), and CRP (7.8 vs. 2.8 mg/dL, P = 0.25).

"This study presents an animal model of native airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). AHR is a fundamental aspect of asthma and reflects an abnormal response characterized by airway narrowing following exposure to a wide variety of non-immunological stimuli. Undescended testis (UDT) is one of the most common male congenital anomalies. The orl rat is a Long Evans substrain with inherited UDT. Since boys born with congenital UDT are more likely to manifest asthma symptoms, the main aim of this study was to investigate the alternative hypothesis that orl rats have greater AHR to a methacholine aerosol challenge than wild type rats. Long Evans wild type (n = 9) and orl (n = 13) rats were anesthetized, tracheostomized, and mechanically ventilated at 4 weeks of age. Escalating concentrations of inhaled methacholine were delivered. The methacholine potency and efficacy in the strains were measured. Respiratory resistance was the primary endpoint.

"Atherosclerosis requires migration of monocytes to the arterial intima, with subsequent differentiation into foam cells. We showed previously that the scavenger receptor CD36 contributes to the activation of Vav family guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Vavs) in aortae from hyperlipidemic apoE-null mice and that oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein induced CD36-dependent activation of macrophage Vavs in vitro. We also discovered that CD36-dependent uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein and foam cell formation were reduced in Vav-deficient macrophages. We now tested the hypothesis that Vavs play a role in atherosclerotic lesion development. We showed that apoE/vav1 double-null mice fed a Western diet had significant reduction in total aortic lesion area (by en face analysis) compared with apoE-null mice, with no significant differences in body weight or plasma lipid profiles. Histological analysis of aortic sinus lesions showed fewer macrophages and foam cells in double-null mice compared with apoE-null mice, indicating impaired foam cell generation and homing of macrophages to atherosclerotic lesions. An intravital video microscopy-based adhesion assay with fluorescent (Qtracker655)-labeled monocytes showed reduced adhesion of vav1-null monocytes to hyperlipidemic carotid arteries compared with wild-type monocytes. Furthermore, fewer fluorescently labeled vav1-null monocytes accumulated in aortic sinus lesions in hyperlipidemic apoE-null mice. We also found that activation of RhoGTPase Rac and mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase-2 by CD36-specific oxidized phospholipids was dependent on Vavs.",Do vav Guanine nucleotide exchange factors regulate atherosclerotic lesion development in mice?,These results for the first time link Vavs to atherosclerotic lesion development and suggest that Vavs act as critical molecular links coupling hyperlipidemia with proatherogenic monocyte/macrophage responses.,0,Do guanine nucleotide exchange factors influence the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in mice?,18.0,1984.0,2150.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3361287117004397,1.7447125911712646,4.283815622329712,"The provided context does not mention vav Guanine nucleotide exchange factors or their role in regulating atherosclerotic lesion development in mice.

"The IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-1) plays a central role in TLR2- and TLR4-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a critical event in the transcriptional regulation of many sepsis-associated proinflammatory mediators. There are two haplotypes for the IRAK-1 gene in Caucasians, with the variant haplotype consisting of five intron single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and three exon SNPs. To examine the functional significance of the IRAK-1 variant haplotype in modifying nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and affecting outcomes from sepsis. One hundred fifty-five Caucasian patients with sepsis were included. Twenty-one (14%) were homozygous for the IRAK-1 variant haplotype as determined by a SNP in which T is replaced with C at nucleotide 1,595 within exon 12 of the IRAK-1 gene. The IRAK-1 variant haplotype was associated with increased nuclear levels of NF-kappaB in LPS-stimulated peripheral blood neutrophils from patients with sepsis compared with that found in patients with wild-type IRAK-1 haplotype (p=0.0009). There was an increased incidence of shock (p=0.047) (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-7.7), greater requirement for more prolonged mechanical ventilator support (p=0.04) (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.05-6.9), and higher 60-d mortality (p=0.05) (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.0-6.8) in patients with the IRAK-1 variant haplotype compared with wild type.",Is variant IRAK-1 haplotype associated with increased nuclear factor-kappaB activation and worse outcomes in sepsis?,"These results indicate that the IRAK-1 variant haplotype is functionally significant in patients with sepsis, being associated with increased nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, more severe organ dysfunction, and higher mortality.",0,Is the IRAK-1 variant haplotype linked to heightened NF-kappaB activation and poorer prognoses in sepsis?,26.0,2764.0,2932.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.7024297714233398,1.6502890586853027,4.414211273193359,"Yes, the variant IRAK-1 haplotype is associated with increased nuclear factor-kappaB activation and worse outcomes in sepsis, including a higher incidence of shock, greater need for prolonged mechanical ventilation, and increased 60-day mortality.",0.9
"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Arginase I (ArgI) on plaque stabilization in unruptured atherosclerotic plaque and explore its mechanism. The atherosclerotic plaque model was established in New Zealand rabbits by balloon injury of abdominal arteries and a high cholesterol (1%) diet. Arginase I overexpression reduced the content of macrophages and lipids and increased that of smooth muscle cells and collagen in the atherosclerotic plaque, thus contributing to decreased plaque vulnerability. Arginase I overexpression decreased the expression of the inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in plaques. In vitro, ArgI overexpression or iNOS inhibition abolished the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 induced by lipopolysaccharide in Raw264.7 cells. However, exogenous l-arginine restored the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Arginase I overexpression inhibited the activity of iNOS without changing its expression. Moreover, ArgI co-localized with iNOS in both Raw264.7 cells and human aortic atherosclerotic plaques. In addition, the IL-10 level was increased in plaque with ArgI overexpression. Finally, ArgI promoted aortic vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, which was associated with increased production of intracellular polyamines.",Does arginase I enhance atherosclerotic plaque stabilization by inhibiting inflammation and promoting smooth muscle cell proliferation?,ArgI enhances the stability of atherosclerotic plaque by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory cytokines and stimulating smooth muscle cell proliferation.,0,1.

"Silicone punctal plugs are widely used to conserve moisture in tear-deficient eyes. We studied the efficacy and tolerability of punctal plugs in symptom reduction and improvement of ocular surface disease parameters in dry eye syndrome. We reviewed the records of 50 consecutive patients with dry eye syndrome who were symptomatic despite maximally tolerable lubricant therapy and had bilateral lower punctal plug insertion. After plug insertion, all patients (41 women and nine men) had 6 months or more of follow-up. The subjects ranged in age from 22 to 57 years (mean, 30 years). We recorded subjective and objective improvement of ocular surface disease, frequency of lubricant use, need for upper punctal occlusion, and occurrence of complications after plug insertion. We determined plug retention rates using Kaplan-Meier analyses and assessed associated factors using Cox proportional hazards models. Six months after initial plug placement, 43 of 50 patients (86%) were symptom free, 28 of them (56%) with plugs alone, and 38 patients (76%) had stopped using lubricants on a daily basis. Spontaneous loss of plugs was common, especially in the initial 3 months of follow-up. Considering all plugs, the estimated probability of plug retention was 63% after 6 months of follow-up. Puncta refitted after initial plug loss were twice as likely to lose the replacement plug (P =.02). Upper punctal plugs showed a 4.3-fold higher risk of loss compared with plugs inserted in lower puncta (P <.0001).",Does efficacy and tolerability outcomes after punctal occlusion with silicone plug in dry eye syndrome?,"There is both a reduced dependency on artificial lubricants and relief of symptoms of dry eye after punctal plugs.

"Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) therapies are not only beneficial for reducing symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but also for structural damage visible on plain radiographs and serological biomarkers of articular cartilage damage. It is not known if these therapies also prevent structural damage in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The low sensitivity to change over time of plain radiographic instruments mandates a search for the effects of these therapies on possible biomarkers of cartilage damage. We studied 2 populations of patients with AS: (1) patients recruited to a placebo controlled trial of etanercept in AS for 16 weeks; (2) an observational cohort receiving infliximab for disease refractory to conventional therapy. Clinical (morning stiffness, nocturnal pain, Bath AS Disease Activity Index) and laboratory [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP)] assessments of disease activity were performed at baseline and at either 16 weeks (clinical trial cohort) or at 14 weeks (observational cohort). We measured serum matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), MMP-3, human cartilage glycoprotein-39 (YKL-40), and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein by ELISA at the same timepoints. We also measured serum concentrations of 2 novel biomarker epitopes, C2C and 846, by competitive ELISA. The C2C assay detects a neoepitope at the carboxy terminus of the long three-quarter amino-terminal fragment generated following cleavage of type II collagen by collagenases. Aggrecan 846 epitope is a chondroitin sulfate epitope present on intact aggrecan molecules. Both these assays would detect products originating from both hyaline cartilages and intervertebral discs. There was a significant reduction in levels of C2C (p = 0.005) and a significant increase in the 846 epitope (p = 0.01) in patients who received etanercept compared to placebo controls. Changes in C2C correlated significantly with changes in ESR (r = 0.51, p = 0.04) and CRP (r = 0.48, p = 0.048). Significant changes in C2C were not evident in the infliximab observational cohort, although significant reductions were noted in levels of MMP-3 (p = 0.04) and MMP-1 (p = 0.02) at 14 weeks that were not observed in the etanercept group. Analysis of all baseline samples showed a significant correlation between levels of MMP-3 with CRP (r = 0.73, p < 0.0001), and YKL-40 (r = 0.71, p < 0.0001).

"The transcription factor STAT6 is crucial for activation of the interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13 pathway and has been linked to regulatory T cells (Tregs). Associations of STAT6 polymorphisms with IgE levels were described; however, their impact on neonatal immune responses and early disease development is unknown. STAT6 polymorphisms were genotyped in cord blood mononuclear cells by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Gene expression was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cytokines by Multiplex. At age 3 years, atopic diseases were assessed by questionnaires.

"Fos-protein immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) was used to identify neurocircuits potentially participating in the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis sensitivity to glucocorticoid-mediated fast-feedback in rats exposed to the physical stressor, hemorrhage, or the psychological stressor, airpuff startle. Marked regional brain differences in the Fos-IR expression were observed in response to these stressors. Specifically, after hemorrhage, nuclear Fos-IR increased in the nucleus of the solitary tract and other brainstem regions known to regulate hemodynamic processes including the supraoptic nucleus, and the magnocellular division of hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In contrast, after airpuff startle Fos-IR increased in the dorsomedial and lateral hypothalamus as well as in the lateral septum. Thus, activation of brainstem neurocircuits predominated after hemorrhage whereas activation of forebrain neurocircuits predominated after airpuff startle. In other regions, the magnitude of stressor-induced Fos-IR expression varied in a region-specific manner. When stressor exposure was preceded by administration of corticosterone to achieve levels within the physiological range after stressors, HPA axis responses were suppressed in response to the airpuff startle but not to either a small or moderate hemorrhage.",Is sensitivity to glucocorticoid-mediated fast-feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dependent upon stressor specific neurocircuitry?,(1) fast-feedback mediated inhibition of HPA axis activity is critically dependent upon stressor modality; (2) this apparent selectivity is reflected by differences in the nature of the neurocircuitry mediating these stressors.

"Mutation or deregulation of certain cellular genes (protooncogenes) results in expression of proteins that appear to promote malignant transformation. Human non-small cell lung cancer has been documented to express many such oncogenes including c-myc, bcl-2, and mutant p53. Antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ASODN) complementary to these oncogenes were tested on three non-small cell lung cancer cell lines for their efficacy in inhibiting cellular proliferation and oncoprotein expression. Established non-small cell lung cancer cell lines A427, SKMES-1, and A549 were grown in the presence of ASODNs complementary to messenger RNA of c-myc, bcl-2, p53, or controls at 1 mumol/L or 10 mumol/L concentrations for 4 or 10 days. Cellular proliferation was measured by tritiated thymidine uptake. Flow cytometry was used to quantitate oncoprotein expression. Intranuclear ASODN uptake was documented by fluoresceine-tagged ASODNs. Fluoresceine-tagged ASODNs were readily taken up by all cell lines. c-myc, as well as bcl-2 and p53 ASODNs, were found to inhibit proliferation of all cell lines significantly compared with controls, most notably in line A549 (40.1% +/- 7.1% of control, p = 0.000 with c-myc ASODN).

"Integrated [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan is a widely used modality in the evaluation of lung cancer. Our goal was to determine the ability of the standard uptake value (SUV) of the primary tumor (SUV-T) and regional lymph nodes (SUV-N) to predict survival. From January 2005 through June 2007, 584 consecutive patients undergoing integrated PET-CT scan for suspected lung cancer were studied. Results of integrated PET-CT scans, including the maximum SUV-T and SUV-N, were recorded. A patient was defined as having a positive PET scan if the maximum SUV (T or N) was greater than 2.5. Overall survival was documented from clinical records and the Social Security Death Index. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between SUV and survival. Among patients with a positive PET scan (n = 329), both SUV-T and SUV-N were predictors of survival. As maximum SUV of the primary mass increased, survival decreased (hazard ratio, 1.05; p < 0.001). As maximum SUV of locoregional lymph nodes increased, survival also decreased (hazard ratio, 1.06; p < 0.001).

"Cyclosporin A (CsA) binds with high affinity to cyclophilin, a critical step in the molecular mechanism of action of cyclosporins, where cyclosporin H (CsH) has extremely low affinity for cyclophilin. CsH differs from CsA by the substitution of the L-methyl valine at position 11 with it D-isomer. We compared the effects of CsA and CsH on the release of performed (histamine) and de novo synthesized inflammatory mediators (peptide leukotriene C4) from peripheral blood basophils activated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). CsH (8 to 800 nmol/L) concentration-dependently inhibited histamine and leukotriene C4 release from purified and unpurified basophils activated by FMLP, whereas CsA (8 to 800 nmol/L) had little inhibitory effect on histamine release from basophils challenged with FMLP. Inhibition of histamine release from basophils challenged with FMLP was extremely rapid and was abolished by washing the cells (three times) before challenge. CsH (8 to 800 nmol/L) had no effect on the release of histamine caused by C5a, platelet activating factor, monocyte chemotactic activating factor, RANTES, IL-8, bryostatin 1, and phorbol myristate. Preincubation of basophils with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (30 and 100 pmol/L), but not IL-1 beta (30 and 100 ng/ml), concentration-dependently reversed the inhibitory effect of CsH on FMLP-induced histamine release. CsH competitively inhibited the effect of FMLP on histamine release from basophils. The dissociation constant (Kd) for the CsH-FMLP receptor complex was approximately 9 x 10(-8) mol/L, more than 10-fold lower than that (approximately equal to 1.3 x 10(-6) mol/L) of N-t-BOC-methionyl-L-leucyl-phenylalanine (BocMLP), a known formyl peptide receptor antagonist. CsH inhibited tritiated FMLP binding to human polymorphonuclear leukocytes with a concentration required to inhibit binding by 50% of approximately 5.4 x 10(-7) mol/L, whereas BocMLP was less potent with a concentration required to inhibit binding by 50% of approximately 9.1 x 10(-5) mol/L. Scatchard analysis revealed that the decreased tritiated FMLP binding caused by CsH was due to a decrease in the Bmax (0.22 +/- 0.04 nmol/L/5 x 10(6) cells vs 0.09 +/- 0.01 nmol/L/5 x 10(6) cells; p < 0.05), without a significant difference in the Kd (5.16 +/- 1.22 nmol/L vs 6.32 +/- 2.42 nmol/L; p = NS).",Is cyclosporin H a potent and selective competitive antagonist of human basophil activation by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine?,CsH is a potent and selective inhibitor of mediator release from basophils induced by activation of the formyl peptide receptor; it acts by interfering with agonist binding to FMLP receptors.,1,Is cyclosporin H an effective and targeted competitive blocker of human basophil stimulation by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine?,35.0,3028.0,3203.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.11226224899292,2.1906039714813232,5.430605411529541,"Yes, cyclosporin H is a potent and selective competitive antagonist of human basophil activation by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP).",0.8
"The evidence for the efficacy of D-cycloserine (DCS) for augmenting cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders has been mixed. Guided by preclinical research and initial findings from a small-scale study involving humans, we tested the hypothesis that DCS enhancement of exposure therapy would be specific to successful exposure sessions. Medication-free adults with generalized social anxiety disorder (N = 145) received 50 mg of DCS or placebo 1 h before each of 5 exposure sessions that were part of a standardized 12-session group CBT protocol. Participants provided fear ratings at the beginning and just before the end of exposure exercises. Independent raters, blind to group assignment, administered the clinical global impression improvement and severity scales at each session and at posttreatment. Mixed-effects analyses revealed that, among patients who reported low fear at the end of an exposure session, those who had received DCS evidenced significantly greater clinical improvement at the next session, relative to those who had received placebo. In contrast, when exposure end fear was high, patients receiving DCS exhibited less clinical improvement at the following session than patients receiving placebo. Similarly, patients who had received DCS evidenced lower clinical severity at posttreatment, relative to patients who had received placebo, only when their average end fear for medication-augmented sessions had been in the low to moderate range. Finally, these moderating effects of exposure success as indexed by end fear were not better accounted for by within-session extinction.",Does d-cycloserine enhancement of exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder depend on the success of exposure sessions?,The efficacy of DCS for augmenting exposure-based CBT depends on the success of exposure sessions.

"Cyclosporin A (CsA) is associated with significant chronic nephrotoxicity, which typically manifests as renal fibrosis. In contrast, rapamycin (RAPA) has been shown to inhibit fibrosis. This study sought to determine the effect of CsA and RAPA on the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and E-cadherin in a rat kidney model of chronic allograft nephropathy. Left renal grafts from male Fisher (F344, RT1(1v1)) rats were orthotopically transplanted into Lewis (LEW, RT1(1)) rats. After transplantation, all recipients were given CsA 10 mg/kg(-1) d(-1) for 10 d and divided into three groups (n = 9/group): (1) vehicle, administered orally; (2) CsA, 6 mg/kg(-1) d(-1); (3) RAPA, 0.8 mg/kg(-1) d(-1). At 4, 8, and 12 wk posttransplantation, the kidney allografts were harvested and serum creatinine levels were measured.

"Although hyponatremia on admission is a predictor of poor prognosis in acute heart failure (AHF) patients, little is known about the association between changes in sodium level in acute phase and in-hospital mortality. This study was performed to clarify the impact of sodium level improvement in the early phase on prognosis in AHF patients. A total of 882 consecutive hospitalized AHF patients were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Sodium levels were evaluated on days 1 and 3 of admission, and patients were classified into three groups: patients with hyponatremia on admission and day 3 (hypo-hypo group); patients with hyponatremia on admission and normonatremia on day 3 (hypo-normo group); and patients with normonatremia on admission (normo group). Hyponatremia (sodium ≤135 mEq/L) was observed in 14.3% of cases. In multivariate linear regression analysis, age (standardized beta=0.084), male gender (standardized beta=-0.072), history of ischemic heart disease (standardized beta=-0.069), baseline sodium level (standardized beta=-0.435), and tolvaptan use (standardized beta=0.093) were independent determinants of changes in sodium level from day 1 to day 3.

"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is associated with primary lung cancer and an increased risk of postoperative acute exacerbation (AE). Although the preoperative factors associated with AE of ILD are well described, there is little information about the postoperative factors. Thus, the present study focuses on the postoperative management of chest-tube drainage associated with AE of ILD. We conducted a retrospective chart study of 1,309 patients with lung cancer, who underwent pulmonary resection at Shizuoka Cancer Center between September 2002 and January 2011. ILD was diagnosed by chest computed tomography (CT) findings in 95 patients. After the exclusion of 6 patients with a history of pneumonectomy, the subjects of this study were 8 patients who suffered AE after surgery (AE group) and 81 patients (non-AE group) who did not. We investigated the clinicopathological findings and postoperative management of chest-tube drainage in the two groups. The clinicopathological findings of the two groups did not differ significantly. The chest tubes could not be removed before postoperative day 5 because of pleural effusion in 5 patients (62.5 %) from the AE group and 12 patients (14.8 %) from the non-AE group (P = 0.0040).",Is chest-tube drainage a sign of acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease associated with lung cancer?,The postoperative volume draining from the chest-tube is an important sign of AE of ILD.,1,Does chest tube drainage indicate an acute worsening of interstitial lung disease linked to lung cancer?,18.0,2245.0,2410.0,1.0,0.1666666666666666,0.3562071871080222,1.5983827114105225,1.88757586479187,5.046664714813232,"Yes, chest-tube drainage can be associated with acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in patients with lung cancer, as indicated by the study which found that patients who suffered acute exacerbation had a higher incidence of prolonged chest-tube drainage compared to those who did not experience exacerbation.",0.7

"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is known to be a proinflammatory cytokine and glucocorticoid-induced immunomodulator as well as a regulator of tumor growth. Although positive and negative effects of MIF on tumor cell growth have been reported, to the authors' knowledge the precise role of MIF in tumorigenesis remains unclear. In the current study the authors assessed expression of MIF protein and mRNA in lung adenocarcinomas with regard to patient prognosis. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on tissue specimens surgically obtained from 74 patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma (American Joint Committee on Cancer pathologic Stages I, II, and IIIa). In addition, expression of MIF mRNA in the cancerous tissue was investigated using in situ hybridization. Patient prognosis was evaluated with regard to MIF expression levels and its distribution was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method. MIF mRNA and MIF protein were observed in the bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelium, vascular smooth muscle, and alveolar macrophages in the normal lung tissue. In tumor tissue from lung adenocarcinoma specimens, both MIF mRNA and protein were observed at much higher levels than in the normal alveolar epithelium. MIF protein was observed diffusely in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in all tumor specimens examined. MIF protein also was observed in the nuclei of tumor cells from 59 patients (79.7%), whereas it was not observed in the nuclei of tumor cells from 15 patients (20.3%).

"Not only clinical factors, including the CHADS(2) score, but also echocardiographic findings have been reported to be useful for predicting the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). However, it remains to be determined which of these factors might be more relevant for evaluation of the risk of stroke in each patient. In 490 patients with NVAF who underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), we examined the long-term incidence of ischemic stroke events (mean follow-up time, 5.7±3.3 years). For each patient, the predictive values of gender, the CHADS(2) risk factors (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, history of cerebral ischemia), the CHADS(2) score, and the findings on echocardiography, including TEE risk markers, were assessed. The ischemic stroke rate was significantly correlated with the CHADS(2) score (p<0.05). According to the results of univariate analyses, age ≥75 years, history of cerebral ischemia, CHADS(2) score ≥2, and presence of TEE risk were significantly correlated with the incidence of ischemic stroke. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses identified age ≥75 years and presence of TEE risk as significant predictors of subsequent ischemic stroke events in patients with NVAF.

"Red ginseng (RG) has been reported to improve the blood and organ lipid profile when combined with exercise. However, the effect of RG on energy metabolism during exercise is poorly understood. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate whether RG treatment alters fat utilization during exercise; We used seven-week-old ICR mice (n = 42). RG (1 g/kg) was administered orally daily during two weeks of endurance training. All mice were randomized into two groups: training only group (CON group) and training with RG group (RG group). Endurance training consisted of 20~25 m/min on a slope of 8° for one hour five times a week. After a two-week experimental period, we measured substrate utilization during exercise at the same intensity and duration of training using a respiratory calorimetry chamber. Mice were dissected for glycogen measurement of muscles and liver before, immediately after, and one hour after the exercise; Fat oxidation during the initial 20 min of the one-hour exercise significantly increased in the RG group compared to the CON group. In addition, the liver glycogen stores significantly decreased immediately after the one-hour exercise compared to at rest in the RG group, but did not differ between immediately after the one-hour exercise and at rest in the RG group.

"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms can continue through adolescence and adulthood, including difficulty in staying focused, paying attention, and controlling behavior, as well as hyperactivity. While children and adolescents with ADHD have functional impairments at multiple dimensions, there are no objective biological indicators to assess the severity of ADHD. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are widely used as a noninvasive method for evaluating sensory and cognitive processes involved in attention tasks. Previous studies have shown that P300 amplitude or latency, a main component in ERPs, is altered in patients with ADHD. However, little is known about the relationship between P300 and the severity of ADHD symptoms. We sought to measure both P300 amplitude and latency in ERPs during auditory oddball tasks in 44 patients with ADHD (mean age ± SD 10.28 ± 3.43 years) and 15 age- and gender-matched normally developing children (11.40 ± 3.02 years). In ADHD patients, we also assessed symptom severity using the ADHD rating scale-IV-Japanese version. In ADHD groups, P300 amplitude and latency were attenuated and prolonged compared to controls at the frontocentral, centroparietal, and parietal positions.

"Over 70% of low-grade gliomas carry a heterozygous R132H mutation in the gene coding for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). This confers the enzyme with the novel ability to convert α-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate, ultimately leading to tumorigenesis. The major source of 2-hydroxyglutarate production is glutamine, which, in cancer, is also a source for tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) anaplerosis. An alternate source of anaplerosis is pyruvate flux via pyruvate carboxylase (PC), which is a common pathway in normal astrocytes. The goal of this study was to determine whether PC serves as a source of TCA anaplerosis in IDH1 mutant cells wherein glutamine is used for 2-hydroxyglutarate production. Immortalized normal human astrocytes engineered to express heterozygous mutant IDH1 or wild-type IDH1 were investigated. Flux of pyruvate via PC and via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) was determined by using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe the labeling of [2-¹³C]glucose-derived ¹³C-labeled glutamate and glutamine. Activity assays, RT-PCR and western blotting were used to probe the expression and activity of relevant enzymes. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data was analyzed to assess the expression of enzymes in human glioma samples. Compared to wild-type cells, mutant IDH1 cells significantly increased fractional flux through PC. This was associated with a significant increase in PC activity and expression. Concurrently, PDH activity significantly decreased, likely mediated by significantly increased inhibitory PDH phosphorylation by PDH kinase 3.

"The function of human macrophage metalloelastase (HME) also known as matrix metalloproteinase 12, in tumorigenesis is contradictory. The current study was designed to investigate the association of HME expression with angiogenesis and prognosis of gastric carcinomas. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to detect HME in human gastric carcinomas, chronic gastritis with atypical hyperplasia, and normal gastric epithelium mucosa. The results were further confirmed by RT-PCR or semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting in gastric carcinomas and paired noncancerous tissues. VEGF and microvessel density count were also detected by immunohistochemical staining in all carcinoma tissues. The prognostic significance of HME was assessed with multiple linear regression analysis and Cox proportional hazards model. High expression of HME protein/mRNA was observed in gastric carcinomas and atypical hyperplasia tissues compared with normal gastric epithelium mucosa, or paired noncancerous tissues. HME protein/mRNA were negatively correlated with MVD (p < 0.01), VEGF (p < 0.01), tumor differentiation grade (p < 0.05), vascular invasion (p < 0.01), and recurrence (p < 0.05-0.01).

"The sympathetic nervous system may play an important role in certain forms of chronic pain. The main aim of this study was to determine whether functional blockade of α1 -adrenoceptors would alter sensitivity to cutaneous stimulation in patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). In an initial study, high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of intradermal interstitial fluid collected from the forearms of three healthy individuals established that the α1 -adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin penetrated the skin barrier when mixed in Lipoderm(®) cream base. Next, we found that application of this cream to the forearm of 10 healthy participants attenuated axon reflex vasodilatation to the iontophoresis of phenylephrine, demonstrating functional blockade of α1 -adrenoceptors. Subsequently, effects of the cream on sensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimulation were investigated in 14 healthy participants and 19 patients with CRPS (eight with an apparent adrenergic component of pain). Both in patients and controls, topical application of the prazosin cream increased sensitivity to skin cooling but reduced sensations evoked by gentle brushing.

"Sparse published data exist on outcomes in daclizumab-treated cardiac transplant patients. One trial observed an increased mortality risk 6 and 12 months posttransplant in patients receiving daclizumab plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), cyclosporine, and steroids. This study further investigates the safety profile of daclizumab with this same immunosuppressive regimen from a large registry. Data obtained at hospital discharge on all adult cardiac transplants performed in the USA between January 1998 and October 2003 for patients receiving MMF plus cyclosporine and steroids were accessed from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Patients were selected based on induction treatment: daclizumab (n = 684) or no induction (n = 2525). Outcomes were evaluated at 6 months, 12 months, and 3 years posttransplant. Univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox models were used to evaluate the effect of treatment on outcomes. Patient survival and infectious death were the primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints included rejection within the first year posttransplant (acute rejection; AR) and total rejection episodes over time. The two treatment groups shared similar demographics and transplant procedure details. Daclizumab (vs no induction) patients had no increased risk of patient death nor infectious death. Daclizumab patients had a lower incidence of AR at 6 months (P = .005) and 12 months (P < .001); the adjusted risk for AR at 12 months (hazards ratio [HR] = 0.77; P = .89) and over 3 years (HR 0.83, P = .006) was also lower in daclizumab-treated patients.","Is daclizumab associated with decreased rejection and no increased mortality in cardiac transplant patients receiving MMF , cyclosporine , and corticosteroids?","In cardiac transplant patients, daclizumab (vs no induction) does not result in increased mortality or infectious death, and is associated with a lower incidence of AR.",1,"1.

"Transjugular intrahepatic stent-shunt (TIPSS) insertion, in patients with uncontrolled gastro-intestinal bleeding, often results in worsening of the systemic hemodynamics which can be associated with intracranial hypertension but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study explored the hypothesis that TIPSS insertion results in acute endotoxemia which is associated with increased nitric oxide production resulting in systemic and cerebral vasodilatation. Twelve patients with cirrhosis who were undergoing TIPSS for uncontrolled variceal bleeding were studied prior to and 1-h after TIPSS insertion. Changes in cardiac output (CO) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were measured. NO production was measured using stable isotopes using l-[guanidino-(15)N(2)] arginine and l-[ureido-(13)C;5,5-(2)H(2)] citrulline infusion. The effect of pre- and post-TIPSS plasma on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity on human endothelial cell-line (HUVEC) was measured. TIPSS insertion resulted in a significant increase in CO and CBF. Endotoxin and induced neutrophil oxidative burst increased significantly without any significant changes in cytokines.

"Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme. Reboxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. The potential interaction of reboxetine with this representative from the azole derivative class was examined. Eleven healthy volunteers received (1) 4 mg reboxetine orally on the second day of a 5-day regimen of 200 mg ketoconazole once daily and (2) 4 mg reboxetine orally in a crossover design. Plasma concentrations of reboxetine enantiomers [R,R(-)-reboxetine and the more active S,S(+)-reboxetine] were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

"Guidelines of the International Consensus on the Diabetic Foot state that ""Amputation of the lower extremity or part of it is usually preceded by a foot ulcer"". The authors' impression has been that this statement might not be applicable among patients treated in our institution. A prospective cohort study was designed to determine the frequency distribution of antecedents of lower limb infection or gangrene and amputation among adult diabetics admitted to a Regional Hospital in western Jamaica. Adult diabetics admitted to Hospital with a primary diagnosis of lower limb infection and/or gangrene were eligible for recruitment for a target sample size of 126. Thirty five variables were assessed for each patient-episode of infection and/or gangrene, main outcome variable being amputation during admission or 6-months follow-up. Primary statistical output is the frequency distribution of antecedents/precipitants of lower limb infection and/or gangrene. The data is interrogated by univariate and multivariable logistic regression for variables statistically associated with the main antecedent/precipitant events. Data for 128 patient-episodes were recorded. Most common antecedents/precipitants, in order of decreasing frequency, were idiopathic acute soft tissue infection/ulceration (30.5%, CI; 22.6-39.2%), chronic neuropathic ulcer (23.4%, CI; 16.4-31.7%), closed puncture wounds (19.5%, CI; 13.1-27.5%) and critical limb ischemia (7.8%, CI; 3.8-13.9%). Variables positively associated with non-traumatic antecedents/precipitants at the 5% level of significance were male gender and non-ulcerative foot deformity for idiopathic acute soft tissue infection/ulcer; diabetes >5 years, previous infection either limb, insulin dependence and peripheral sensory neuropathy for chronic neuropathic ulcer and older age, diabetes >5 years, hypertension, non-palpable distal pulses and ankle-brachial index ≤0.4 for critical limb ischemia.",Is chronic neuropathic ulcer the most common antecedent of lower limb infection or amputation among diabetics admitted to a regional hospital in Jamaica : results from a prospective cohort study?,"Chronic neuropathic ulcer accounted for only 23.4 % of lower limb infections and 27.7% of amputations in this population of diabetics, making it the second most common antecedent of either after acute idiopathic soft tissue infection/ulcer at 30.5 and 34.7% respectively.

"Interest in the role of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in protection from HIV infection has grown since analyses of the RV144 HIV vaccine trial results found ADCC correlated with protection. Natural killer (NK) cells are among the effector cells that mediate ADCC. The level of antibody-induced NK cell activation depends on NK cell education through inhibitory NK cell receptor human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligand interactions. Here, we investigated the impact of NK cell education on the delivery of Granzyme B (GzB) to target cells. Lymphocytes from 50 HIV-uninfected [30 Bw4 (Bw4) and 20 Bw4 (Bw6)] KIR3DL1 homozygote persons were used as effectors and cocultured with gp120-coated target cells in the presence of a single source of anti-HIV gp120 antibody to ascertain whether NK cell education status influenced the level of GzB delivered to target cells. The GTL assay assessed the frequency of GzB-positive (%GzB) CEM.NKr.CCR5 target cells generated by effectors from each individual. The frequency of CD107a, interferon (IFN)-γ and CCL4 NK cells was assessed as a measure of antibody-induced NK cell activation. KIR3DL1 NK cells from the Bw4 group were more functional than KIR3DL1 NK cells.

Human HCC cell lines (Huh-7 and HepG2 cells) were used, and cell growth was assessed using MTS assay. CA-IX expression and apoptotic/kinase signaling were evaluated using immunoblotting. The cells were transfected with CA-IX-specific siRNA, or treated with its inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonamide (CAI#1), and/or the hexokinase II inhibitor, 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP). A clinic pathological analysis of 69 patients who underwent an HCC resection was performed using a tissue array. Incubation of HCC cells under hypoxia (1% O₂, 5% CO₂, 94% N₂) for 36 h significantly increased CA-IX expression level. CAI#1 (400 μmol/L) or CA-IX siRNA (100 μmol/L) did not influence HCC cell growth and induce apoptosis. However, CAI#1 or CA-IX siRNA at these concentrations enhanced the apoptosis induced by 3-BP (100 μmol/L). This enhancement was attributed to increased ER stress and JNK activation, as compared with 3-BP alone. Furthermore, a clinic pathological analysis of 69 HCC patients revealed that tumor CA-IX intensity was inversely related to E-cadherin intensity.",Does inhibition of hypoxia-inducible carbonic anhydrase-IX enhance hexokinase II inhibitor-induced hepatocellular carcinoma cell apoptosis?,"Inhibition of hypoxia-induced CA-IX enhances hexokinase II inhibitor-induced HCC apoptosis.

"Zinc (Zn) is one of the most important trace elements in the body. Zn deficiency seems to play a role in the development of age-related diseases and impairment of quality of life. Zn status has been especially studied in free-living or hospitalised people, but data from older residents of nursing homes are scarce. This study aimed to determine the Zn status among the older individuals in correlation to their mental and physical performance. A total of 100 participants aged between 60-102 years were recruited between October 2010 and May 2012 at the nursing home in Bialystok (Poland). Zn status was evaluated by determining the concentration in serum by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Anthropometric variables and fitness score (FS) were measured.

"Perivascular adipose tissue secretes an adipocyte-derived relaxing factor(s) (ADRF) that opens K(v) channels in rat arteries. Visceral fat accumulation causes adipocyte dysfunction, including hyposecretion of adiponectin. We tested the hypothesis that ADRF might be adiponectin and that adiponectin plays a role in the paracrine control of vascular tone by perivascular adipose tissue. We studied Sprague-Dawley rats, wild-type and adiponectin gene-deficient (Apn 1-/-) mice, and New Zealand obese (NZO) mice. In rat aortas, recombinant adiponectin at serum levels (2-5 microg/ml) inhibited serotonin-induced contractions. The effects were abolished by K(v) channel inhibition with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 2 mM). Similar effects were observed in NZO mouse mesenteric arteries. To study vascular function in Apn 1-/- mice, the mesenteric vascular bed was isolated, cannulated, and perfused at a constant 4-5-ml/min flow in the absence and presence of serotonin. 4-AP (2 mM) induced a similar increase in perfusion pressure in the Apn 1-/- perfused isolated mesenteric vascular bed, compared to wild-type mice. Removal of perivascular fat increased the vasoconstrictor responses, but abolished the 4-AP effects. The anti-contractile effects of perivascular fat were similar in mesenteric artery and aortic rings from Apn 1-/- and wild-type mice. Despite high adiponectin levels, the anti-contractile effects of perivascular fat were diminished in mesenteric arteries of NZO mice with age.",Is adiponectin a novel humoral vasodilator?,"Adiponectin is a novel humoral vasodilator that relaxes aortic and mesenteric rings by opening K(v) channels.

"Chronic cannabis use can induce psychotic states that resemble schizophrenia. Yet, schizophrenic patients often smoke cannabis as a form of self-medication to counter the aversive symptoms of schizophrenia. We recently demonstrated an ameliorating effect of cannabinoid self-administration (SA) on negative and cognitive schizophrenia-like symptoms induced experimentally by the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP). Whether cannabinoid SA alleviates or exacerbates schizophrenia-like positive symptoms is still unclear. This follow-up study aimed to evaluate the effect of self-administered cannabinoid on PCP-induced schizotypic positive symptoms in adult rats. Male rats were trained to self-administer either the cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN; 12.5 μg/kg/infusion) or its vehicle (Veh) intravenously. The effects of acute and chronic intermittent intraperitoneal administration of PCP (2.5 mg/kg) on motor parameters were then tested in Veh-SA and WIN-SA. Cannabinoid SA significantly attenuated the psychotomimetic effects of PCP exposure observed in control rats. Following acute PCP administration, WIN-SA animals displayed more frequent rearing and lower anxiety-like profile than Veh-SA rats. WIN-SA rats also exhibited lower behavioural sensitisation to chronic PCP treatment as demonstrated by reduced hyperlocomotion in response to an acute PCP challenge. In addition, parallel experiments performed in experimenter-administered rats that received WIN at comparable SA doses confirmed the ameliorating effects of cannabinoid exposure on PCP-induced schizotypic behaviours, indicating that motivational effects were not responsible for the ameliorative effects of cannabinoids.",Does chronic cannabinoid exposure reduce phencyclidine-induced schizophrenia-like positive symptoms in adult rats?,Our results indicate that cannabis may exert protective effects on positive schizotypic symptoms in adult animals such as hypermotility and anxiety state.,1,1.

"Physician and patient gender both influence medical communication. Nonverbal behavior is generally under-researched in the medical encounter but plays an important role for patient outcomes such as satisfaction. This article aims at identifying how specific physician nonverbal behaviors predict analogue patient satisfaction depending on physician and patient gender. Eleven physicians in a real medical encounter were videotaped and analogue patients indicated their satisfaction with each physician while viewing the videotapes. One hundred sixty-three university students participated (analogue patients). From the videotapes, 17 physician nonverbal behaviors (related to face, body, voice/speech), 2 physician appearance cues, 2 characteristics of the examination room, and 1 patient behavior were coded. For each analogue patient, the correlation between each of these coded characteristics and the patient's satisfaction was calculated, across all physicians and across male and female physicians separately. There was no main effect for patient gender but most coded characteristics showed different relations to patient satisfaction according to physician gender. Analogue patients were most satisfied with female physicians who behaved in line with the female gender role (eg, more gazing, more forward lean, softer voice) while still stressing their professionalism (laboratory coat, medical-looking examination room). For male physicians, satisfaction was high for a broader range of behaviors, partly related to their gender role (eg, louder voice, more distance to patient).",Does physician gender affect how physician nonverbal behavior is related to patient satisfaction?,"To be satisfied, patients expect female and male physicians to show different patterns of nonverbal behavior.

"Nitric oxide (NO) has proven benefits in treating adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The protective mechanism remains unclear, but cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent signal transduction pathways have been suggested. Our laboratory has implicated polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) priming and subsequent activation in the pathogenesis of postinjury ARDS and has shown that NO inhibits superoxide anion production from activated PMNs. More recently, the pivotal role of elastase in PMN-mediated tissue injury has been emphasized. Consequently, our study hypothesis was that NO attenuates platelet-activating factor (PAF) priming for elastase release through a cGMP-dependent pathway in human PMNs. PMNs isolated from human volunteers were preincubated with the NO donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1; 10(-6) to 10(-2) mol/L), cGMP (10(-3) mol/L), or the cell-permeable cGMP analog dibutyryl-cGMP (10(-3) mol/L) for 10 minutes. The cells were then primed with platelet-activating factor (PAF) 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (200 nmol/L), which was followed by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) activation (1 mumol/L). Elastase release was measured by the cleavage of N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val p-nitroanilide (AAPV-pNA). NO (through SIN-1) significantly attenuated elastase release from PAF-primed PMNs in a dose-dependent manner. Cell-permeable dibutyryl-cGMP attenuated PMN elastase release similar to NO, but cGMP (not cell-permeable) had no effect.",Does nitric oxide attenuate platelet-activating factor priming for elastase release in human neutrophils via a cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent pathway?,NO attenuates elastase release from PAF-primed PMNs through an intracellular cGMP-dependent signal transduction pathway.

"A loss of sensation in the lower limbs, observed in individuals with diabetes as well as elderly individuals, contributes to postural instability, altered gait patterns, increased risk of falling, and decreased quality of life. To determine if somatosensory cues delivered to sensate areas of the lower limbs above the ankle joints enhance the control of posture in individuals with peripheral neuropathy. Twelve subjects with sensory neuropathy due to diabetes participated in static and dynamic balance tests with and without auxiliary sensory cues provided to the lower limbs without stabilizing the ankle joints. During the tests the subjects were required to stand on a fixed or moving computer-controlled platform with their eyes open or closed. Equilibrium scores and response latency were obtained. For all tests, equilibrium scores were significantly larger in experiments with auxiliary sensory cues in comparison with conditions without cues (P < .05). Smaller latency scores were recorded in conditions with auxiliary sensory information.

"Cognitive decline may occur as a result of hypertension, and is dependent on the function of hippocampus. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mediated by angiotensin II-induced oxidative stress protects against cell death in hippocampus. Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), candesartan, activates BDNF in the hippocampus. Furthermore, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma activation in the brain prevents brain damage. Telmisartan, a unique ARB with PPAR-gamma stimulating activity, protects against cognitive decline partly because of PPAR-gamma activation. The aim of the present study was to determine whether telmisartan protects against cognitive decline via up-regulation of BDNF and its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) in the hippocampus of hypertensive rats, partly because of PPAR-gamma activation. We divided stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs), as hypertensive and vascular dementia model rats, into five groups, telmisartan-treated (TLM), TLM+GW9662, a PPAR-gamma inhibitor, -treated (T+G), GW9662-treated (GW), TLM+ANA-12, a TrkB antagonist, -treated (T+A), and vehicle-treated SHRSPs (VEH). After the treatment for 28 days, systolic blood pressure did not change in all groups. However, BDNF expression in the hippocampus was significantly higher in TLM than in VEH to a greater extent than in T+G. Cognitive performance was significantly higher in TLM than in VEH to a greater extent than in T+G, and was not different between T+A, GW, and VEH.",Does telmisartan protect against cognitive decline via up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin-related kinase B in hippocampus of hypertensive rats?,"Telmisartan protects against cognitive decline via up-regulation of BDNF/TrkB in the hippocampus of SHRSPs, partly because of PPAR-gamma activation independent of blood pressure-lowering effect.",1,1.

"Tesofensine is a novel triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor which is in development for the treatment of obesity. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that appetite suppression is an important mechanism by which tesofensine exerts its robust weight reducing effect. Notably, the strong hypophagic response to tesofensine treatment is demonstrated to be linked to central stimulation of noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission. The sympathomimetic mode of action of tesofensine may also associate with the elevated heart rate and blood pressure observed in clinical settings, and we therefore sought experimentally to address this issue. The anorexigenic and cardiovascular effects of tesofensine were studied simultaneously in telemetrized conscious rats in a combined real-time food intake and cardiovascular telemetry monitoring system. Acute administration of tesofensine caused a dose-dependent hypophagic effect as well as increased heart rate and blood pressure. Interestingly, combined treatment with metoprolol (b1 adrenoceptor blocker, 10-20 mg/kg, p.o.) fully prevented the cardiovascular sympathetic effects of tesofensine while leaving the robust inhibitory efficacy on food intake unaffected. Similarly, the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan (1.0-3.0 mg/kg, p.o.) did not interfere with the anti-obesity effects of tesofensine, however, telmisartan only partially reversed the increase in systolic blood pressure and had no effect on the elevated heart rate induced by tesofensine.",Does anti-hypertensive treatment preserve appetite suppression while preventing cardiovascular adverse effects of tesofensine in rats?,"These data suggests that tesofensine causes elevations in heart rate and blood pressure by increasing sympathetic activity, and that different adrenoceptor subtypes may be responsible for the anti-obesity and cardiovascular effects of tesofensine.",1,1.

"Therapeutic hypothermia is a treatment modality that is increasingly used to improve clinical neurological outcomes for ischemia-reperfusion injury-mediated diseases. Antibody-initiated classical complement pathway activation has been shown to contribute to ischemia-reperfusion injury in multiple disease processes. However, how therapeutic hypothermia affects complement activation is unknown. Our goal was to measure the independent effect of temperature on complement activation, and more specifically, examine the relationship between clinical hypothermia temperatures (31-33°C), and complement activation. Antibody-sensitized erythrocytes were used to assay complement activation at temperatures ranging from 0-41°C. Individual complement pathway components were assayed by ELISA, Western blot, and quantitative dot blot. Peptide Inhibitor of complement C1 (PIC1) was used to specifically inhibit activation of C1. Antibody-initiated complement activation resulting in eukaryotic cell lysis was increased by 2-fold at 31°C compared with 37°C. Antibody-initiated complement activation in human serum increased as temperature decreased from 37°C until dramatically decreasing at 13°C. Quantitation of individual complement components showed significantly increased activation of C4, C3, and C5 at clinical hypothermia temperatures. In contrast, C1s activation by heat-aggregated IgG decreased at therapeutic hypothermia temperatures consistent with decreased enzymatic activity at lower temperatures. However, C1q binding to antibody-coated erythrocytes increased at lower temperatures, suggesting that increased classical complement pathway activation is mediated by increased C1 binding at therapeutic hypothermia temperatures. PIC1 inhibited hypothermia-enhanced complement-mediated cell lysis at 31°C by up to 60% (P = 0.001) in a dose dependent manner.",Do clinical hypothermia temperatures increase complement activation and cell destruction via the classical pathway?,"In summary, therapeutic hypothermia temperatures increased antibody-initiated complement activation and eukaryotic cell destruction suggesting that the benefits of therapeutic hypothermia may be mediated via other mechanisms.

"Antibiotic therapy can select for small colony variants of Staphylococcus aureus that are more resistant to antibiotics and can result in persistent infections, necessitating the development of more effective antimicrobial strategies to combat small colony variant infections. Photodynamic therapy is an alternative treatment approach which utilises light in combination with a light-activated antimicrobial agent to kill bacteria via a non-specific mechanism of action. In this study, we investigated whether the combination of 665 nm laser light and the light-activated antimicrobial agent methylene blue was able to successfully kill S. aureus small colony variants. S. aureus and isogenic stable small colony variant were exposed to varying doses (1.93 to 9.65 J/cm2) of 665 nm laser light in the presence of varying concentrations (1 to 20 μM) of methylene blue. The combination of 665 nm laser light and methylene blue was found to be an effective strategy for the killing of small colony variants.

"Growing studies have revealed the underlying association between eNOS 894G/T (rs1799983) polymorphism and coronary heart disease (CHD) among Asia population. Results from these studies remained conflicting. We conducted this meta-analysis to estimate the overall CHD risk of eNOS 894G/T polymorphism regarding Asia population.

We determined spectral powers of mainly sympathetically mediated low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) and parasympathetically mediated high-frequency (0.15-0.5 Hz) RRI fluctuations, and sympathetic low-frequency powers of blood pressure fluctuations. We normalized RRI powers by relating low-frequency and high-frequency powers to total powers (low-frequency + high-frequency powers), assessed the RRI low-frequency/high-frequency ratio reflecting sympathicovagal balance. As a measure of BRS, we used the alpha-index, obtained as square root of the ratio between powers of simultaneous spectral analyses of spontaneous low-frequency variabilities in RRIs and SBP (coherence>0.5). We compared parameters in supine and standing position of untreated and treated patients with those of 15 healthy age-matched (27+/-5 years) men (repeated-measure analysis of variance, significance at P<0.05). Supine biosignals were similar in all groups. Upon standing, RRIs were lower in controls and patients after ERT than in patients before ERT (P<0.05); normalized RRI high-frequency powers as well as BRS decreased, whereas DBP, low-frequency/high-frequency ratios and sympathetic low-frequency powers of SBP increased in controls and treated patients only (P<0.05).",Does enzyme replacement therapy improve cardiovascular responses to orthostatic challenge in Fabry patients?,"Reduced increase in heart rate, blood pressure and sympathetic activation, and limited cardiovagal withdrawal and BRS adjustment seen in untreated Fabry patients upon standing normalized after 18 and 23 months of ERT demonstrating improved baroreflex function, which, in turn, is an established parameter of improved disease prognosis.",1,1.

"To examine whether the distribution of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) recorded from foramen ovale electrodes (FOEs) correlates with metabolite levels in medial structures of the temporal lobes in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). We studied 34 patients with MTLE. The lateralization ratio of IEDs was calculated after counting IEDs recorded from FOEs during prolonged video-EEG monitoring. Metabolite ratio between N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and creatine (Cr) was calculated in each medial temporal structure. The correlation between the lateralization ratio of IEDs and metabolic ratio was evaluated. The asymmetry indexes of IEDs correlated with the asymmetry index of NAA/Cr ratio in the medial temporal structure (rho = -0.380; p = 0.027). Analysis of IEDs and metabolite ratio revealed a significant inverse relation in the contralateral side to the major epileptogenic focus (rho = -0.360; p = 0.037); however, this significance was not present in the ipsilateral side (rho = -0.018; p = 0.921).",Do interictal epileptiform discharges relate to 1H-MRS-detected metabolic abnormalities in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy?,"There is a correlation between the neuronal dysfunction or damage detected by MRS and the epileptic activity in the contralateral medial temporal structure.

"Low- and middle-income countries face a disproportionate burden of death and disability from injuries, many of which are due to road traffic accidents or falls. Lower extremity injuries in particular have implications not only for physical disabilities affecting work and school performance, but also for quality of life (QOL) of the individual. This qualitative study explores the psychosocial impact and QOL changes due to lower extremity injuries among trauma patients in central Malawi. We transcribed and translated interviews with 20 patients who received care for a trauma to the lower extremity at a tertiary hospital in Lilongwe. We used NVivo to organize and thematically analyze the data. Participants reported limitations in physical functioning, activities of daily living, social roles, and vocational and social activities. Limited mobility led to unplanned long-term disruptions in work, personal financial loss, and household economic hardship. As a result, psychological distress, fears and worries about recovery, and poor perceptions of health and QOL were common. Several contextual factors influenced patient outcomes including socioeconomic status, religious beliefs, social networks, local landscape, housing structures, and transportation accessibility.",Is `` Life at a standstill '' Quality of life after lower extremity trauma in Malawi?,Lower extremity trauma led to physical suffering and ongoing social and economic costs among Malawians.

"Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a rare proliferative disorder of the synovium with locally aggressive behavior. We reviewed our experience using radiation therapy in the treatment of PVNS. Seventeen patients with 18 sites of PVNS were treated with radiation between 1993 and 2007. Cases were retrospectively reviewed for patient information, treatment parameters, complications, and outcome. Seven sites were primary presentations and 11 were recurrent with an average of 2.5 prior surgical interventions. The most common location was the knee joint (67%). Cytoreductive surgery was performed before radiation therapy in 16/18 sites with all having proven or suspected residual disease. Radiation was delivered using 4-15 MV photons with an average total dose 34 Gy (range, 20-36 Gy). Seventeen of 18 sites (94%) had postradiotherapy imaging. With average follow-up of 46 months (range, 8-181 months), initial local control was achieved in 75% (12/16) of the sites with prior cytoreductive surgery (mean time to recurrence, 38 months). Ultimate local control was 100% after repeat resection (mean follow-up, 61 months). Two additional sites without prior cytoreductive surgery showed growth after radiotherapy (mean time to documented growth, 10.5 months). Seventeen of the 18 involved joints (94%) were scored as excellent or good PVNS-related function, one site (5%) as fair function, and no site with poor function.

"Administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) relieves symptoms in Crohn's disease (CD). It has been reported that reduced GM-CSF bioactivity is associated with more aggressive ileal behaviour and that GM-CSF-null mice exhibit ileal barrier dysfunction and develop a transmural ileitis following exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). STAT5 signalling is central to GM-CSF action. It was therefore hypothesised that GM-CSF signalling in non-haematopoietic cells is required for ileal homeostasis. Bone marrow (BM) chimeras were generated by reconstituting irradiated GM-CSF receptor (gm-csfr) beta chain or GM-CSF (gm-csf) deficient mice with wild type BM (WTBM-->GMRKO and WTBM-->GMKO). Intestinal barrier function and the response to NSAID-induced ileal injury were examined. Expression of gm-csf, gm-csfr or stat5 in Caco-2 and HT-29 intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines was knocked down and the effect of GM-CSF signalling on IEC survival and proliferation was determined. Elevated levels of GM-CSF autoantibodies in ileal CD were found to be associated with dysregulation of IEC survival and proliferation. GM-CSF receptor-deficient mice and WTBM-->GMRKO chimeras exhibited ileal hyperpermeability. NSAID exposure induced a transmural ileitis in GM-CSF receptor-deficient mice and WTBM-->GMRKO chimeras. Transplantation of wild type BM into GM-CSF-deficient mice prevented NSAID ileal injury and restored ileal barrier function. Ileal crypt IEC proliferation was reduced in WTBM-->GMRKO chimeras, while STAT5 activation in ileal IEC following NSAID exposure was abrogated in WTBM-->GMRKO chimeras. Following knock down of gm-csf, gm-csfr alpha or beta chain or stat5a/b expression in Caco-2 cells, basal proliferation was suppressed. GM-CSF normalised proliferation of Caco-2 cells exposed to NSAID, which was blocked by stat5a/b RNA interference.",Does loss of GM-CSF signalling in non-haematopoietic cells increase NSAID ileal injury?,"Loss of GM-CSF signalling in non-haematopoietic cells increases NSAID ileal injury; furthermore, GM-CSF signalling in non-haematopoietic cells regulates ileal epithelial homeostasis via the STAT5 pathway.

"Buruli ulcer (BU) is an emerging infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans that can result in extensive necrotizing cutaneous lesions due to the cytotoxic exotoxin mycolactone. There is no specific vaccine against BU but reports show some degree of cross-reactive protection conferred by M. bovis BCG immunization. Alternatively, an M. ulcerans-specific immunization could be a better preventive strategy. In this study, we used the mouse model to characterize the histological and cytokine profiles triggered by vaccination with either BCG or mycolactone-negative M. ulcerans, followed by footpad infection with virulent M. ulcerans. We observed that BCG vaccination significantly delayed the onset of M. ulcerans growth and footpad swelling through the induction of an earlier and sustained IFN-γ T cell response in the draining lymph node (DLN). BCG vaccination also resulted in cell-mediated immunity (CMI) in M. ulcerans-infected footpads, given the predominance of a chronic mononuclear infiltrate positive for iNOS, as well as increased and sustained levels of IFN-γ and TNF. No significant IL-4, IL-17 or IL-10 responses were detected in the footpad or the DLN, in either infected or vaccinated mice. Despite this protective Th1 response, BCG vaccination did not avoid the later progression of M. ulcerans infection, regardless of challenge dose. Immunization with mycolactone-deficient M. ulcerans also significantly delayed the progression of footpad infection, swelling and ulceration, but ultimately M. ulcerans pathogenic mechanisms prevailed.",Does cellular immunity confer transient protection in experimental Buruli ulcer following BCG or mycolactone-negative Mycobacterium ulcerans vaccination?,The delay in the emergence of pathology observed in vaccinated mice emphasizes the relevance of protective Th1 recall responses against M. ulcerans.

"Animal data suggest an association between neuroinflammation and secondary brain injury including axonal injury after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). We sought to study the association between brain extracellular interleukin (IL)-6 and TAU-protein levels as a surrogate marker for neuroinflammation and axonal injury in patients with poor grade aSAH. Prospectively collected data from 26 consecutive poor-grade aSAH patients with multimodal neuromonitoring including cerebral microdialysis (CMD) were retrospectively analyzed. IL-6 and TAU-protein levels were analyzed using ELISA from a single CMD-sample every 24 hours and correlated with brain metabolic and hemodynamic parameters. Patients were dichotomized to high-grade (N=10) or low-grade (N=16) neuroinflammation according to their median CMD-IL-6 levels. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations to account for multiple within-subject measurements. Perilesional probe location (P=0.02) and aSAH related intracerebral hemorrhage (aICH) volume (P=0.003) at admission were associated with high-grade neuroinflammation. Brain extracellular TAU-protein levels (P=0.001), metabolic distress and delayed cerebral infarction (DCI; P=0.001) were linked to high-grade neuroinflammation.

"Breast cancer is a genetically complex disease, which involves the accumulation of various structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations. To assess the numerical status of chromosomes 16 and X by interphase cytogenetics, in 114 women with primary invasive breast carcinomas, in relation to clinicopathological parameters, patients' overall survival and indices of cell growth (c-erbB-2, topoisomerase IIalpha (topoIIalpha)) and cell survival (caspase-3, bcl-2). Chromogenic in situ hybridisation with pericentromeric probes was performed for molecular analysis, while oestrogen and progesterone receptors, cerbB-2, topoIIalpha, caspase-3 and bcl-2 expression was immunohistochemically detected (ABC/HRP). The results were statistically assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Polysomy of chromosomes 16 and X was detected as the predominant aberration (73.7% and 57.9%, respectively). Gain of chromosome 16 copies was associated with high nuclear grade (p = 0.009), increased tumour size (p = 0.041), advanced stage (p = 0.002), the expression of topoIIalpha (p = 0.005) and worse overall survival by multivariate analysis (p = 0.032).

"Central nervous system complications of cardiac catheterization are most often attributed to embolic events that occur at the time of catheter manipulation. Nevertheless, the reason that over 50% of these events are localized to the posterior circulation remains unexplained.

"To use both whole-brain and normal-appearing brain tissue (NABT) T1 relaxation time histograms to investigate abnormalities in early relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS). In patients with established MS, both lesions and NABT exhibit an increase in T1 relaxation time. By using T1 histogram analysis, it is hoped that such changes in early disease can be detected. Twenty-seven patients and 14 age- and sex-matched controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, which included the following sequences: 1) proton density (PD)- and T2-weighted fast spin echo (FSE) to measure T2 lesion load, 2) PD- and T1-weighted gradient echos from which T1 relaxation was calculated, and 3) T1-weighted SE imaging pre- and post-triple dose (0.3 mmol/kg) gadolinium (Gd-DTPA) to measure T1 hypointense and gadolinium-enhancing lesion loads, respectively. All patients had RR MS with disease duration <3 years (median 1.7 years). Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 99 was used to segment brain from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and lesions were segmented using a local thresholding technique. Both whole-brain and NABT histograms were abnormal for all six T1 histogram parameters that were measured. For NABT, the mean T1 was 1,027 (+/- 74) ms in patients and 969 (+/- 41) ms in controls (p=0.003).

"For hepatic resection, the preoperative estimation of hepatic functional reserve in the predicted remnant liver may be more important than that of the entire liver. We evaluated the maximal removal rate of technetium-99m-galactosyl-human serum albumin (GSA-Rmax) in the remnant. One hundred and seventy-eight patients were admitted for elective hepatectomy. Conventional liver function, and 15-minute retention rate of indocyanine green (ICGR15) were carried out preoperatively. The GSA-Rmax was calculated according to a radiopharmacokinetic model; then we used the single photon emission computed tomography images to calculate the regional GSA-Rmax in the predicted residual liver (GSA-RL), depending on the operative procedures. The volume of the predicted residual liver (LV-RL) was calculated on the basis of computed tomography images. The preoperative LV-RL correlated well with the GSA-RL in patients with normal liver; however, there was no such correlation in those with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. All of 7 postoperative hyperbilirubinemia occurred in the patients with GSA-RL < 0.15. Two patients died of postoperative liver failure 1 to 2 months after the operation.

"Hip fracture is a common injury with associated high mortality. Recent drives by the Department of Health have sought to prioritise these patients' care. In April 2010, the Best Practice Tariff was introduced in England and Wales. This offers financial incentives to institutions that provide holistic care and surgery within 36h for hip fracture patients. The England and Wales National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published its first guidance on hip fracture management in June 2011, and emphasised the need for surgery on the day or day after admission. In spite of the emphasis placed on this injury, the predictors of in-hospital mortality remain ill-defined. In particular the effect of the timing of surgery remains contentious. To address the issues raised by NICE around surgical timing and examine whether surgery before a 36h watershed improves survival. In addition, to examine survival outcomes for each 12h watershed following admission. Prospectively collected data on 2056 patients presenting to our unit with hip fractures between February 2008 and May 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Multivariate regression analysis was used to correct for confounders, and so determine the effect of various parameters on in-patient mortality. Age (p<0.0001), male-gender (p<0.0001), source of admission (p<0.05), ASA-grade (p<0.0001) and delay of surgery (p<0.01) were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality.

"The cytotoxic effects of cisplatin and anthracyclins have been attributed to apoptosis induction, which has been recognized as a major function of the TP53 gene. The TP53 gene appears to be mutated in about 50% of cases of non-small cell lung cancer. A possible dependence of chemotherapy response on TP53 genotype was evaluated retrospectively in a group of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and induction treatment. Patients with complete or partial remission were compared with those with stable or progressive disease with respect to TP53 genotype and overall survival. Mutations in the TP53 gene were detected by complete direct sequencing (exons 2-11). A normal TP53 genotype proved to be significantly associated with major response to chemotherapy (P <.001). Overall, no association was found between p53 protein expression and TP53 genotype. A normal TP53 genotype was found to be highly sensitive in predicting response to treatment, whereas a mutant genotype was revealed to be specific in predicting lack of response. The difference in overall length of survival was significant between patients exhibiting a normal TP53 genotype (corresponding to those whose disease responded to chemotherapy) and patients showing mutant TP53 genotype (corresponding to those who had disease resistant to chemotherapy, P =.027).",Is the TP53 genotype but not immunohistochemical result predictive of response to cisplatin-based neoadjuvant therapy in stage III non-small cell lung cancer?,"In a small cohort of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer we found a direct link between normal TP53 genotype and response to cisplatin-based induction treatment and also between mutant genotype and resistance to treatment, whereas p53 immunohistochemical result was predictive of neither.",1,"1.

"The value of multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) in the detection of localized retinal dysfunction in vascular branch disease at the posterior pole of the eye is investigated, and mfERG is compared with visual field defects. 10 eyes of 7 patients were tested, of which 8 eyes had a branch retinal vein occlusion and 2 eyes a branch artery occlusion. First order mfERG's were performed with the VERIS (TM) system, using 61 and 103 hexagons, and visual fields with the OCTOPUS M1 macular program.

"The effects of long-term administration of the tricyclic antidepressant agent desipramine on the hypnotic, antinociceptive, anesthetic-sparing, and central norepinephrine turnover suppressant action of short-term dexmedetomidine, a highly selective alpha2-adrenergic agonist, were studied in rats. Rats were given a 3- or 4-week course of twice daily administration of desipramine, 10 mg/kg, or saline. The effect of a hypnotic dose of dexmedetomidine, 250 microg/kg given intraperitoneally, on the duration of loss of righting reflex was determined. The tail flick latency response was determined before and after 50 microg/kg dexmedetomidine. The minimum anesthetic concentration of halothane and the central norepinephrine turnover rate were determined before and after administration of 30 microg/kg dexmedetomidine. Changes in the affinity and density of the alpha2-adrenergic receptor in locus coeruleus and spinal cord also were determined. Treatment with desipramine decreased dexmedetomidine-induced loss of righting reflex duration by 67% and eliminated the antinociceptive effect of dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine produced a 55% decrease in minimum anesthetic concentration in the control group but no reduction in desipramine-treated rats. Desipramine did not change the receptor density or binding affinity of alpha2 receptors at the site for hypnotic (locus coeruleus) or antinociceptive (spinal cord) responses.

"IA injections of SIJs with corticosteroids are often performed in patients suffering from low back pain due to active sacroiliitis. However, SIJ injections are technically demanding, and therefore the clinical outcome of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid SIJ injections was analysed in relation to the accuracy of the injection. Ultrasound-guided injections were performed with 40 mg triamcinolone and 0.78 mg gadolinium in 20 SIJ of 14 consecutive patients suffering from active sacroiliitis. Immediately following SIJ injection, MRI scanning was initiated to verify the correct placement of the drug. Clinical outcome of the intervention was determined using a numerical pain rating scale (NRS) at Days 1 and 28. Despite ultrasound guidance, only 8 injections (40%) were exactly positioned into the SIJ space, whereas the other 12 injections (60%) missed the SIJ. However, there were no significant differences observed in the clinical outcome between the IA-injected group and the peri-articular-injected group.

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a lethal disease. For patients with localized PDAC, surgery is the best option, but with a median survival of less than 2 years and a difficult and prolonged postoperative course for most, there is an urgent need to better identify patients who have the most aggressive disease. We analyzed the gene expression profiles of primary tumors from patients with localized compared to metastatic disease and identified a six-gene signature associated with metastatic disease. We evaluated the prognostic potential of this signature in a training set of 34 patients with localized and resected PDAC and selected a cut-point associated with outcome using X-tile. We then applied this cut-point to an independent test set of 67 patients with localized and resected PDAC and found that our signature was independently predictive of survival and superior to established clinical prognostic factors such as grade, tumor size, and nodal status, with a hazard ratio of 4.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-10.0).

"Gene isoforms are commonly found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Since each isoform may perform a specific function in response to changing environmental conditions, studying the dynamics of gene isoforms is important in understanding biological processes and disease conditions. However, genome-wide identification of gene isoforms is technically challenging due to the high degree of sequence identity among isoforms. Traditional targeted sequencing approach, involving Sanger sequencing of plasmid-cloned PCR products, has low throughput and is very tedious and time-consuming. Next-generation sequencing technologies such as Illumina and 454 achieve high throughput but their short read lengths are a critical barrier to accurate assembly of highly similar gene isoforms, and may result in ambiguities and false joining during sequence assembly. More recently, the third generation sequencer represented by the PacBio platform offers sufficient throughput and long reads covering the full length of typical genes, thus providing a potential to reliably profile gene isoforms. However, the PacBio long reads are error-prone and cannot be effectively analyzed by traditional assembly programs. We present a clustering-based analysis pipeline integrated with PacBio sequencing data for profiling highly similar gene isoforms. This approach was first evaluated in comparison to de novo assembly of 454 reads using a benchmark admixture containing 10 known, cloned msg genes encoding the major surface glycoprotein of Pneumocystis jirovecii. All 10 msg isoforms were successfully reconstructed with the expected length (~1.5 kb) and correct sequence by the new approach, while 454 reads could not be correctly assembled using various assembly programs. When using an additional benchmark admixture containing 22 known P. jirovecii msg isoforms, this approach accurately reconstructed all but 4 these isoforms in their full-length (~3 kb); these 4 isoforms were present in low concentrations in the admixture. Finally, when applied to the original clinical sample from which the 22 known msg isoforms were cloned, this approach successfully identified not only all known isoforms accurately (~3 kb each) but also 48 novel isoforms.",Does distinguishing highly similar gene isoforms with a clustering-based bioinformatics analysis of PacBio single-molecule long read?,"PacBio sequencing integrated with the clustering-based analysis pipeline achieves high-throughput and high-resolution discrimination of highly similar sequences, and can serve as a new approach for genome-wide characterization of gene isoforms and other highly repetitive sequences.",1,Is it possible to differentiate closely related gene isoforms using a clustering bioinformatics approach on PacBio single-molecule long reads?,25.0,2006.0,2159.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.8374016284942627,2.094232082366944,4.9093217849731445,"Yes, distinguishing highly similar gene isoforms can be achieved using a clustering-based bioinformatics analysis of PacBio single-molecule long reads, as demonstrated by the successful reconstruction of isoforms in the study.",1.0
"To determine whether the pattern of involvement of the gastric mucosa in lymphocytic gastritis is predictive of the presence or absence of duodenal pathology. 50 cases (M:F, 26:24; median age 57 years) diagnosed as lymphocytic gastritis between 1986 and 1998 with concurrent duodenal (D2) biopsies were identified from a computer search of the pathology records and validated by counting gastric intraepithelial lymphocytes. Gastric and duodenal intraepithelial lymphocyte counts were performed on haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and anti-CD3 stained sections. D2 biopsies were assessed for villous atrophy and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration by subjective grading, and gastritis was classified and graded according to the updated Sydney system. A case was designated corpus predominant when the corpus chronic inflammation grade exceeded that of the antrum. If it was less, then the case was antrum predominant, and if they were equal it was diffuse (pan-) gastritis. The ratio between the corpus and antral intraepithelial lymphocyte count in individual patients was calculated. Of 50 cases of lymphocytic gastritis, 21 were classified as corpus predominant. With one exception (a case of mild villous atrophy), all were accompanied by normal duodenal morphology. Cases with a corpus predominant gastritis had median duodenal intraepithelial lymphocyte counts of 19 (H&E) and 14.1 (CD3), whereas 29 subjects with an antrum predominant or diffuse gastritis had median counts of 39.9 (H&E) and 37.9 (CD3). Fifteen of these 29 cases (52%) showed villous atrophy; all were graded as moderate or severe. Patients with any degree of villous atrophy had a mean corpus/antrum intraepithelial lymphocyte ratio (H&E) of 0.59 (representing antral predominance), while those with normal duodenal morphology had a ratio of 2.39 (p < 0.0001).",Is the pattern of involvement of the gastric mucosa in lymphocytic gastritis predictive of the presence of duodenal pathology?,"The pattern of involvement of gastric mucosa in lymphocytic gastritis is closely related to the associated duodenal pathology.

"Exertional heat stroke is a cause of collapse in marathon runners. Rectal temperature (T(rectal)) measurement is the usual method of estimating core temperature in collapsed runners, and temporal artery thermometer (TAT) measurement is untested for field use in marathon runners and other athletes. The objective of this study is to compare TAT measurement with T(rectal) measurement in collapsed marathon runners. TAT-500i (Exergen Corp, Wellesley, MA) temperature measurements were obtained using the manufacturer's instruction manual on 60 collapsed marathon runners who had T(rectal) measurements in the finish area medical tent during two consecutive annual races.

"The hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) at sea level (SL) is moderately predictive of the change in pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) to acute normobaric hypoxia. However, because of progressive changes in the chemoreflex control of breathing and acid-base balance at high altitude (HA), HVR at SL may not predict PASP at HA. We hypothesized that resting oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo₂) at HA would correlate better than HVR at SL with PASP at HA. In 20 participants at SL, we measured normobaric, isocapnic HVR (L/min · -%Spo₂⁻¹) and resting PASP using echocardiography. Both resting Spo₂ and PASP measures were repeated on day 2 (n = 10), days 4 to 8 (n = 12), and 2 to 3 weeks (n = 8) after arrival at 5,050 m. These data were also collected at 5,050 m in life-long HA residents (ie, Sherpa [n = 21]). Compared with SL, Spo₂ decreased from 98.6% to 80.5% (P < .001), whereas PASP increased from 21.7 to 34.0 mm Hg (P < .001) after 2 to 3 weeks at 5,050 m. Isocapnic HVR at SL was not related to Spo₂ or PASP at any time point at 5,050 m (all P > .05). Sherpa had lower PASP (P < .01) than lowlanders on days 4 to 8 despite similar Spo₂. Upon correction for hematocrit, Sherpa PASP was not different from lowlanders at SL but was lower than lowlanders at all HA time points. At 5,050 m, although Spo₂ was not related to PASP in lowlanders at any point (all R² ≤ 0.05, P > .50), there was a weak relationship in the Sherpa (R² = 0.16, P = .07).",Does chemoreceptor Responsiveness at Sea Level Predict the Pulmonary Pressure Response to High Altitude?,We conclude that neither HVR at SL nor resting Spo₂ at HA correlates with elevations in PASP at HA.,1,1.

"Dietary habits are involved in the development of chronic inflammation; however, the impact of dietary profiles of hepatitis C virus carriers with persistently normal alanine transaminase levels (HCV-PNALT) remains unclear. The decision-tree algorithm is a data-mining statistical technique, which uncovers meaningful profiles of factors from a data collection. We aimed to investigate dietary profiles associated with HCV-PNALT using a decision-tree algorithm. Twenty-seven HCV-PNALT and 41 patients with chronic hepatitis C were enrolled in this study. Dietary habit was assessed using a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. A decision-tree algorithm was created by dietary variables, and was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (AUROC). In multivariate analysis, fish to meat ratio, dairy product and cooking oils were identified as independent variables associated with HCV-PNALT. The decision-tree algorithm was created with two variables: a fish to meat ratio and cooking oils/ideal bodyweight. When subjects showed a fish to meat ratio of 1.24 or more, 68.8% of the subjects were HCV-PNALT. On the other hand, 11.5% of the subjects were HCV-PNALT when subjects showed a fish to meat ratio of less than 1.24 and cooking oil/ideal bodyweight of less than 0.23 g/kg. The difference in the proportion of HCV-PNALT between these groups are significant (odds ratio 16.87, 95% CI 3.40-83.67, P = 0.0005).

"One of the primary goals of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is to create widely patent paranasal sinus ostia, and lateralization of a middle turbinate (MT) after ESS can obstruct otherwise patent ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. Numerous methods have been used to assist in the avoidance of this complication including the use of packing in the ethmoid sinus as a ""spacer,"" controlled creation of synechia between the MT and septum, and suture medialization of the MT to the septum. The latter is an effective technique, but because the olfactory groove lies superior in the groove between the MT and septum, concerns have been raised as to the effect of this maneuver on olfaction. The aim of this pilot study was to objectively evaluate olfaction before and after suture conchopexy, and, secondarily, to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique in preventing lateralization of the MT. This study was designed to assess the effect of suture medialization of the MT during ESS on olfactory sensation. Objective assessment of olfactory function using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) was performed before and 6 months after ESS in 153 patients between January 2006 and January 2008. Postoperative follow-up exams were also performed to determine the effectiveness of the medialization procedure and the patency of the ethmoid cavities. UPSIT testing showed a small but statistically significant improvement in olfactory function after MT suture medialization to the septum when compared with preoperative assessment. Postoperative endoscopic examination revealed that lateralization of the MT was a rare complication after suture medialization of the MT.",Does middle turbinate suture conchopexy during endoscopic sinus surgery impair olfaction?,MT suture medialization during ESS is an effective method for preventing lateralization of the MT and does not impair olfactory function.,1,1.

"To examine the methylation levels of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK3) and GLOXD1 and their potential clinical applications in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). mRNA expression and promoter methylation of IRAK3 and GLOXD1 in HCC cells were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and methylation-specific PCR (MSP), respectively. Using pyrosequencing results, we further established a quantitative MSP (Q-MSP) system for the evaluation of IRAK3 and GLOXD1 methylation in 29 normal controls and 160 paired HCC tissues and their adjacent nontumor tissues. We also calculated Kaplan-Meier survival curves to determine the applications of gene methylation in the prognosis of HCC. IRAK3 and GLOXD1 expression was partially restored in several HCC cell lines after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor; 5DAC). A partial decrease in the methylated band was also observed in the HCC cell lines after 5DAC treatment. Using GLOXD1 as an example, we found a significant correlation between the data obtained from the methylation array and from pyrosequencing. The methylation frequency of IRAK3 and GLOXD1 in HCC tissues was 46.9% and 63.8%, respectively. Methylation of IRAK3 was statistically associated with tumor stage. Moreover, HCC patients with IRAK3 methylation had a trend toward poor 3-year disease-free survival (P < 0.05).",Is methylation of IRAK3 a novel prognostic marker in hepatocellular carcinoma?,IRAK3 and GLOXD1 were frequently methylated in HCC tissues compared to normal controls and nontumor tissues.

"To investigate the role of polo-like kinase -1 (PLK1) in the first cleavage of a zygote in culture. This experiment took place in the Reproductive Medicine Center of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, from 1st June 2009 to 20th November 2009. First, we detected the expression of PLK1 during the first zygotic division by using Western blotting, and then we reduced the expression of PLK1 during the first zygotic division by ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference (including 4 groups: PLK1 small interfering RNA (siRNA), siRNA control, mock transfection, and only zona pellucida (ZP) removal), finally we evaluated and compared the first cleavage rates of the 4 groups. The expression of PLK1 peaked in the first M phase of zygotic cleavage (3 samples/group, 100 zygotes/sample).

"Intrathecal (IT) opioid and local anesthetic combinations are popular for labor analgesia because of rapid, effective pain relief, but the duration of analgesia is limited. This study was undertaken to determine whether the addition of clonidine and neostigmine to IT bupivacaine-fentanyl would increase the duration of analgesia without increasing side effects for patients in labor. Forty-five healthy parturients in active labor were randomized to receive a 2-ml IT dose of one of the following dextrose-containing solutions using the combined spinal-epidural technique: (1) bupivacaine 2.5 mg and fentanyl 25 microg (BF); (2) BF plus clonidine 30 microg (BFC); or (3) BFC plus neostigmine 10 microg (BFCN). Pain, sensory levels, motor block, side effects, maternal vital signs, and fetal heart rate were systematically assessed. Patients administered BFCN had significantly longer analgesia (165+/-32 min) than those who received BF (90+/-21 min; P<0.001) or BFC (123+/-21 min; P<0.001).

"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be divided into two major subsets based on the presence or absence of antibodies to citrullinated peptide antigens (ACPA). Until now, data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have only been published from ACPA-positive subsets of RA or from studies that have not separated the two subsets. The aim of the current study is to provide and compare GWAS data for both subsets. GWAS using the Illumina 300K chip was performed for 774 ACPA-negative patients with RA, 1147 ACPA-positive patients with RA and 1079 controls from the Swedish population-based case-control study EIRA. Imputation was performed which allowed comparisons using 1,723,056 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). No SNP achieved genome-wide significance (2.9 × 10⁻⁸) in the comparison between ACPA-negative RA and controls. A case-case association study was then performed between ACPA-negative and ACPA-positive RA groups. The major difference in this analysis was in the HLA region where 768 HLA SNPs passed the threshold for genome-wide significance whereas additional contrasting SNPs did not reach genome-wide significance. However, one SNP close to the RPS12P4 locus in chromosome 2 reached a p value of 2 × 10⁶ and this locus can thus be considered as a tentative candidate locus for ACPA-negative RA.",Does a genome-wide association study suggest contrasting associations in ACPA-positive versus ACPA-negative rheumatoid arthritis?,ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative RA display significant risk allele frequency differences which are mainly confined to the HLA region.

"Type 1 diabetic individuals are thought to have increased arterial stiffness, and are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. However, it is not known whether increased arterial stiffness in type 1 diabetes causes cardiovascular disease. To explore this issue, the present study investigated the association, in type 1 diabetes, of age and pulse pressure, an estimate of arterial stiffness, and the influence of the presence of microvascular complications on this association. In addition, we determined the association of mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure with incident cardiovascular disease. We studied a cohort of 3250 type 1 diabetic individuals of the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study. Mean age and median follow-up were 33 and 7.4 years. One hundred and sixty-three individuals developed a first manifestation of cardiovascular disease during follow-up. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the association of age with pulse pressure. Relative risks of cardiovascular disease were estimated by Cox regression analyses adjusted for age, sex and mean arterial pressure or pulse pressure.RESULTS In cross-sectional analyses, age was associated with pulse pressure (P < 0.001) and this association was stronger in the presence of micro- or macroalbuminuria or retinopathy than in their absence (interaction for albuminuria, P < 0.001; interaction for retinopathy, P < 0.001).

"Prospective observational cohort study. To determine if postoperative cervical sagittal balance is an independent predictor of health-related quality of life outcome after surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Both ventral and dorsal fusion procedures for CSM are effective at reducing the symptoms of myelopathy. The importance of cervical sagittal balance in predicting overall health-related quality of life outcome after ventral versus dorsal surgery for CSM has not been previously explored. A prospective, nonrandomized cohort of 49 patients undergoing dorsal and ventral fusion surgery for CSM was examined. Preoperative and postoperative C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis was measured on standing lateral cervical spine radiographs. Outcome was assessed with 2 disease-specific measures-the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association scale and the Oswestry Neck Disability Index and 2 generalized outcome measures-the Short-Form 36 physical component summary (SF-36 PCS) and Euro-QOL-5D. Assessments were performed preoperatively, and at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Most patients experienced improvement in all outcome measures regardless of approach. Both preoperative and postoperative C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis measurements were independent predictors of clinically significant improvement in SF-36 PCS scores (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02). The majority of patients with C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis values greater than 40 mm did not improve from an overall health-related quality of life perspective (SF-36 PCS) despite improvement in myelopathy.

"The liver is characterized by sexually dimorphic gene expression translating into sex-specific differences in lipid, drug, steroid hormone, and xenobiotic metabolism, with distinct responses of males and females to environmental challenges. Here, we investigated the role of the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)-associated protein 1 (KAP1) epigenetic regulator in this process. Liver-specific KAP1 knockout (KO) led to strikingly sexually dimorphic phenotypic disturbances, including male-predominant steatosis and hepatic tumors with up-regulation of protein kinase B and extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. This correlated with the sex-specific transcriptional dysregulation of a wide range of metabolic genes, notably those involved in retinol and sex hormone processing as well as in detoxification. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing indicated that a number of dysregulated genes are direct targets of the KRAB/KAP1 repression system.

Foam cells sourced from macrophages were cultured with PNS. The content of cholesterol ester in foam cells was analyzed and expressions of ABCA1 and liver X receptor α (LXRα) in foam cells were measured by real-time PCR and western blotting methods. The results showed that PNS could significantly decrease the level of cholesterol ester in foam cells at middle and high dosages.

We examined whether their expression is useful to predict survival of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESC). Expression of p21, p27, p53, and Rb was studied by the immunohistochemical method in specimens from 62 patients with curatively resected ESC tumors and scored by a computerized image analysis system. The median expression scores of p21, p27, p53, and Rb (14, 12, 27, and 50, respectively) were used as cut-off points to define low and high expression groups for each protein. The 5-year survival rate for the high p21 expression group was 68%; that for the low expression group was 31% (P = .0062). p27, p53, and Rb were not correlated with overall survival. When patients were categorized into four groups based on p21 expression level and lymph node involvement (pN), the survival curves were significantly different (P = .0017). Thus, patients without lymph node involvement but with low p21 expression had survival similar to that of patients with lymph node involvement and high p21 expression.

"Despite significant improvements in intensive care medicine, the prognosis of acute renal failure (ARF) remains poor, with mortality ranging from 40% to 65%. The aim of the present observational study was to analyze the influence of patient characteristics and fluid balance on the outcome of ARF in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The data were extracted from the Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients (SOAP) study, a multicenter observational cohort study to which 198 ICUs from 24 European countries contributed. All adult patients admitted to a participating ICU between 1 and 15 May 2002, except those admitted for uncomplicated postoperative surveillance, were eligible for the study. For the purposes of this substudy, patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had ARF.

"We investigated the role of intracellular pH in protection by propofol of glutamate uptake during oxidative stress. Exposure of primary astrocyte cultures to tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BOOH, 300 microM) decreased the initial rate of Na-dependent glutamate uptake. Either propofol or alpha-tocopherol, administered 30 min after t-BOOH, attenuated this transport inhibition. These lipophilic antioxidants protected glutamate uptake whether the medium contained 25 mM bicarbonate or was nominally bicarbonate-free. t-BOOH also inhibited Na/H exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) activation by intracellular protons and propofol prevented this inhibition. Blockade of NHE1 by the potent antagonist, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (1 microM), abolished the protective effects of small concentrations of propofol (1 microM) and alpha-tocopherol (40 microM) on glutamate uptake during oxidative stress in bicarbonate-free medium. 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride had no effect on antioxidant rescue of glutamate transport in medium containing 25 mM bicarbonate. These results indicate that regulation of intracellular pH may contribute to neuroprotection by propofol and other lipophilic antioxidants. Propofol concentrations that are associated with anesthesia and neuroprotection may prevent intracellular acidification during oxidative stress by preserving the NHE1 response to cytosolic protons.

The effect of metformin on the expression of various enzymes involved in theca cell steroidogenesis was examined. Metformin (50 microM and 200 microM) significantly inhibited androstenedione production from both forskolin-stimulated and unstimulated theca cells. Testosterone production was also significantly inhibited in forskolin-treated cells in the presence of 200 microM of metformin-treated compared with forskolin-only-treated cells. Western blot analysis revealed that metformin significantly inhibited the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein and 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17) expression in cells stimulated with forskolin compared with forskolin treatment alone. There was no significant change in either 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta HSD) or cholesterol side-chain cleavage (CYP11A1) protein expression. Northern analysis revealed a significant decrease in the expression of CYP17 mRNA in forskolin-stimulated cells treated with metformin (200 microM) compared with forskolin-only-treated cells, however, there was no significant change in steroidogenic acute regulatory protein mRNA expression.",Does metformin directly inhibit androgen production in human thecal cells?,Our results suggest that metformin may have a direct effect on thecal cells' androgen production.,1,1.

"Among prospective cohorts of people who inject drugs (PWID), phylogenetic clustering of HCV infection has been observed. However, the majority of studies have included older PWID, representing distant transmission events. The aim of this study was to investigate phylogenetic clustering of HCV infection among a cohort of street-involved youth. Data were derived from a prospective cohort of street-involved youth aged 14-26 recruited between 2005 and 2012 in Vancouver, Canada (At Risk Youth Study, ARYS). HCV RNA testing and sequencing (Core-E2) were performed on HCV positive participants. Phylogenetic trees were inferred using maximum likelihood methods and clusters were identified using ClusterPicker (Core-E2 without HVR1, 90% bootstrap threshold, 0.05 genetic distance threshold). Among 945 individuals enrolled in ARYS, 16% (n=149, 100% recent injectors) were HCV antibody positive at baseline interview (n=86) or seroconverted during follow-up (n=63). Among HCV antibody positive participants with available samples (n=131), 75% (n=98) had detectable HCV RNA and 66% (n=65, mean age 23, 58% with recent methamphetamine injection, 31% female, 3% HIV+) had available Core-E2 sequences. Of those with Core-E2 sequence, 14% (n=9) were in a cluster (one cluster of three) or pair (two pairs), with all reporting recent methamphetamine injection.

"Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) resulting from exposure to low molecular weight chemicals is a common clinical condition in industrialized countries and can be mediated by either Th1 or Tc1 lymphocytes. The animal model of contact sensitivity (CS) is commonly used to study ACD in mice and helps to test new therapeutics. We have previously shown that epicutaneous (EC) immunization with TNP-Ig prior to hapten sensitization inhibits Th1-mediated CS and observed that the suppression is mediated by TCRαβ(+) CD4(+) CD8(+) cells and is TGF-β dependent. More recently we have shown that EC immunization with DNP-BSA induces TCRαβ(+) CD4(+) CD25(+) FoxP3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells that suppress Tc1-mediated CS. Animal model of contact sensitivity was used to study skin-induced suppression. Current work employing Tc1-mediated CS shows that skin-induced suppression is dose-dependent and declines with time.

"Inhibitory interneurons constitute 30-40% of neurons in laminae I-III and have an important anti-nociceptive role. However, because of the difficulty in classifying them we know little about their organisation. Previous studies have identified 3 non-overlapping groups of inhibitory interneuron, which contain neuropeptide Y (NPY), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) or parvalbumin, and have shown that these differ in postsynaptic targets. Some inhibitory interneurons contain galanin and the first aim of this study was to determine whether these form a different population from those containing NPY, nNOS or parvalbumin. We also estimated the proportion of neurons and GABAergic axons that contain galanin in laminae I-III. Galanin cells were concentrated in laminae I-IIo, with few in laminae IIi-III. Galanin showed minimal co-localisation with NPY, nNOS or parvalbumin in laminae I-II, but most galanin-containing cells in lamina III were nNOS-positive. Galanin cells constituted ~7%, 3% and 2% of all neurons in laminae I, II and III, and we estimate that this corresponds to 26%, 10% and 5% of the GABAergic neurons in these laminae.

"To evaluate the effects of the various methods of small bowel preparation on the quality of visualization of the small bowel and the gastrointestinal transit time of capsule endoscopy (CE). Ninety patients referred for CE were prospectively randomized to three equal groups according to the preparation used: (a) a control group, in which patients were requested to drink 1 L of clear liquids only, 12 h before the examination; (b) a purgative group, in which patients were requested to ingest 1 L of a polyethylene glycol (PEG)/electrolyte solution only, 12 h before the examination; or (c) a purgative combined with simethicone group (P-S group), in which patients were requested to ingest 1 L of PEG, 12 h before the examination, and 300 mg of simethicone, 20 min before the examination. Effects of the different bowel preparations on the gastric transit time (GTT), small bowel transit time (SBTT), examination completion rate, quality of images of the entire small intestine, and cleansing of the proximal small bowel and distal ileum were evaluated. The number of patients with ""adequate"" cleansing of the entire small intestine was 17 in the P-S group, 12 in the purgative group, and seven in the control group (P= 0.002).

"Autoimmune pancreatitis is a distinctive disease entity characterized by high serum immunoglobulin G4 concentrations. Because of the close association between some autoimmune diseases and particular alleles of major histocompatibility complex genes, we investigated the association between HLA alleles and autoimmune pancreatitis. HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ gene typing and HLA-DRB1, -DQB1, and -DPB1 allele typing were performed by the polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primers method and the restriction fragment length polymorphism method, respectively, in 40 patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, 43 patients with chronic calcifying pancreatitis, and 201 healthy subjects.

"Our understanding of the local source of pain in osteoarthritis (OA) remains unclear. We undertook this study to determine if the presence of high-signal osteophytes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was associated with pain presence, location or severity. Subjects were chosen from the Boston Osteoarthritis of the Knee Study, a natural history study of symptomatic knee OA. Assessments included knee MRI, pain assessments and information on weight and height. Osteophyte signal was defined as areas of increased signal intensity in the osteophyte on fat-suppressed T2 weighted images, and graded in the joint margins where osteophyte size is graded. All patients were evaluated with the frequent knee symptoms question for pain presence, the Western Ontario McMasters Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) for pain severity, and location of self-reported pain was recorded as present or absent based on locations identified on a standardized diagram. The osteophyte signal measures anywhere within one given knee were summed, creating an osteophyte signal aggregate. Logistic regression was conducted with quartile of osteophyte signal aggregate as the independent predictor and frequent knee symptom question as the dependent outcome. Association between quartile of osteophyte signal aggregate and pain severity on WOMAC was assessed using a linear regression. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between compartment-specific high-signal osteophytes aggregates (independent variable) and compartment-specific knee pain (dependent variable). Analyses were adjusted for gender, body mass index (BMI), and age. Two hundred and seventeen subjects were included in this analysis.

"The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is implicated in a variety of clinically important diseases, notably rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. Consequently, antagonists of CXCR3 are of therapeutic interest. In this study, we set out to characterize binding sites of the specific low MW CXCR3 antagonist VUF10085 and the broad spectrum antagonist TAK-779 which blocks CXCR3 along with CCR2 and CCR5. Molecular modelling of CXCR3, followed by virtual ligand docking, highlighted several CXCR3 residues likely to contact either antagonist, notably a conserved aspartate in helix 2 (Asp-112(2:63) ), which was postulated to interact with the quaternary nitrogen of TAK-779. Validation of modelling was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis of CXCR3, followed by assays of cell surface expression, ligand binding and receptor activation. Mutation of Asn-132(3.33) , Phe-207 and Tyr-271(6.51) within CXCR3 severely impaired both ligand binding and chemotactic responses, suggesting that these residues are critical for maintenance of a functional CXCR3 conformation. Contrary to our hypothesis, mutation of Asp-112(2:63) had no observable effects on TAK-779 activity, but clearly decreased the antagonist potency of VUF 10085. Likewise, mutations of Phe-131(3.32) , Ile-279(6.59) and Tyr-308(7.43) were well tolerated and were critical for the antagonist activity of VUF 10085 but not for that of TAK-779.",Does cXCR3 antagonist VUF10085 bound to an intrahelical site distinct from that of the broad spectrum antagonist TAK-779?,"This more detailed definition of a binding pocket within CXCR3 for low MW antagonists should facilitate the rational design of newer CXCR3 antagonists, with obvious clinical potential.",1,Is the cXCR3 inhibitor VUF10085 associated with a unique intrahelical binding location compared to the broad-spectrum inhibitor TAK-779?,30.0,2408.0,2571.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.887287139892578,1.4673831462860107,5.328745603561401,"Yes, the CXCR3 antagonist VUF10085 binds to an intrahelical site that is distinct from that of the broad spectrum antagonist TAK-779.",0.5
"T-box transcription factors play critical roles in the coordinated formation of the working chambers and the atrioventricular canal (AVC). Tbx2 patterns embryonic myocardial cells to form the AVC and suppresses their differentiation into chamber myocardium. Tbx20-deficient embryos, which fail to form chambers, ectopically express Tbx2 throughout the entire heart tube, providing a potential mechanism for the function of Tbx20 in chamber differentiation. To identify the mechanism of Tbx2 suppression by Tbx20 and to investigate the involvement of Tbx2 in Tbx20-mediated chamber formation. We generated Tbx20 and Tbx2 single and double knockout embryos and observed that loss of Tbx2 did not rescue the Tbx20-deficient heart from failure to form chambers. However, Tbx20 is required to suppress Tbx2 in the developing chambers, a prerequisite to localize its strong differentiation-inhibiting activity to the AVC. We identified a bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp)/Smad-dependent Tbx2 enhancer conferring AVC-restricted expression and Tbx20-dependent chamber suppression of Tbx2 in vivo.

Quantifying differences in terms of carbon allocation and the proportion of recently fixed carbon in soil CO(2) efflux is crucial for addressing the carbon footprint of creeping degradation. We compared the carbon allocation pattern of the late successional gymnosperm Podocarpus falcatus (Thunb.) Mirb. and the early successional (gap filling) angiosperm Croton macrostachyus Hochst. es Del. in an Ethiopian Afromontane forest by whole tree (13)CO(2) pulse labeling. Over a one-year period we monitored the temporal resolution of the label in the foliage, the phloem sap, the arbuscular mycorrhiza, and in soil-derived CO(2). Further, we quantified the overall losses of assimilated (13)C with soil CO(2) efflux. (13)C in leaves of C. macrostachyus declined more rapidly with a larger size of a fast pool (64% vs. 50% of the assimilated carbon), having a shorter mean residence time (14 h vs. 55 h) as in leaves of P. falcatus. Phloem sap velocity was about 4 times higher for C. macrostachyus. Likewise, the label appeared earlier in the arbuscular mycorrhiza of C. macrostachyus and in the soil CO(2) efflux as in case of P. falcatus (24 h vs. 72 h). Within one year soil CO(2) efflux amounted to a loss of 32% of assimilated carbon for the gap filling tree and to 15% for the late successional one.",Does rate of belowground carbon allocation differ with successional habit of two afromontane trees?,"Our results showed clear differences in carbon allocation patterns between tree species, although we caution that this experiment was unreplicated. A shift in tree species composition of tropical montane forests (e.g., by degradation) accelerates carbon allocation belowground and increases respiratory carbon losses by the autotrophic community.

"The aims of the study were to investigate (1) speech perception outcomes in people with an early-onset hearing loss (HL) who received a cochlear implant as an adolescent or adult, (2) prognostic factors associated with positive speech perception outcomes, and (3) self-report outcomes in these participants. Outcomes for 38 implant recipients with a Nucleus device were investigated retrospectively. All participants were diagnosed with a bilateral HL at age #3 yr and were implanted at age 14 yr or older. Nineteen participants had confirmed bilateral, severe to profound HL at age #12 mo (prelingual); nine had confirmed bilateral, severe to profound HL at age.12 mo and #3 yr (perilingual); and the remaining 10 had a diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural HL at age #3 yr which progressed to severe to profound HL after 3 yrs of age (progressive). There were 24 females and 14 males, and the average age at implantation was 33 yr (range 5 14-65 yr). Closed-set and open-set speech perception tests administered pre- and postimplant were analyzed for all participants, in addition to self-report survey measures of benefit, satisfaction, and implant usage. Participants were placed into one of five hierarchic categories of speech perception performance preimplantation and at 12 mo postimplantation. The categories ranged from sound detection only (category 1) to excellent open-set speech perception (category 5). To be in category 4 or 5, the participant had to score.30% words correct on a recorded version of either the Central Institute for the Deaf Everyday Sentence Lists or the City University of New York Sentences. Before implantation, two recipients (5%) were in category 4 or 5 compared with 20 (53%) at 12 mo postimplant. Consistent with previous studies, there was large intersubject variability in speech scores. Three factors accounted for 63% of the variance on open-set sentence test scores, postimplant: mode of communication in childhood (oral versus total communication/sign), stable as opposed to progressive loss, and time without a hearing aid on the implant ear. More than 80% of survey respondents used their device.8 hr a day, and 90% reported that their ability to understand speech with visual cues was ""much better"" with the implant.

"Maternal perception of reduced fetal movement (RFM) is associated with increased risk of stillbirth and fetal growth restriction (FGR). DFM is thought to represent fetal compensation to conserve energy due to insufficient oxygen and nutrient transfer resulting from placental insufficiency. To date there have been no studies of placental structure in cases of DFM. To determine whether maternal perception of reduced fetal movements (RFM) is associated with abnormalities in placental structure and function. Placentas were collected from women with RFM after 28 weeks gestation if delivery occurred within 1 week. Women with normal movements served as a control group. Placentas were weighed and photographs taken. Microscopic structure was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and image analysis. System A amino acid transporter activity was measured as a marker of placental function. Placentas from all pregnancies with RFM (irrespective of outcome) had greater area with signs of infarction (3.5% vs. 0.6%; p<0.01), a higher density of syncytial knots (p<0.001) and greater proliferation index (p<0.01).

"Tubular cell apoptosis plays a crucial role in different kinds of renal diseases. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a polyphenol extracted from green tea, has been shown to inhibit renal fibrosis in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice, but its role in preventing tubular cell apoptosis and the underlying signaling mechanisms still remains unclear. Mice subjected to UUO were intraperitoneally administered EGCG (5 mg/kg) for 14 d. Normal rat kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell line NRK-52E was induced by transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). Periodic acid-schiff and Masson's trichrome staining was used for histologic study. TUNEL, Hoechst staining, and flow cytometry analysis were used to measure the apoptotic status of tubular cells. Western blotting was used to determine the expression of apoptotic-associated proteins and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway proteins. EGCG significantly attenuated tubular injury and renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the obstructed kidneys of UUO mice. In addition, EGCG prevented UUO and TGF-β1-induced tubular apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In parallel, protein expression of B-clell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) was upregulated and protein expressions of Bcl-2 accosiated X protein (Bax), cleaved caspase 3, and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) were downregulated by EGCG. Furthermore, UUO and TGF-β1-stimulated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase was inhibited by EGCG.",Does epigallocatechin-3-gallate reduce tubular cell apoptosis in mice with ureteral obstruction?,EGCG effectively reduces tubular cell apoptosis induced by UUO and may have potential as a clinical treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease.,1,1.

"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited genetic syndrome with highly variable clinical manifestations. Fifteen genetic subtypes of FA have been identified. Traditional complementation tests for grouping studies have been used generally in FA patients and in stepwise methods to identify the FA type, which can result in incomplete genetic information from FA patients. We diagnosed five pediatric patients with FA based on clinical manifestations, and we performed exome sequencing of peripheral blood specimens from these patients and their family members. The related sequencing data were then analyzed by bioinformatics, and the FANC gene mutations identified by exome sequencing were confirmed by PCR re-sequencing. Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations of FANC genes were identified in all of the patients. The FA subtypes of the patients included FANCA, FANCM and FANCD2. Interestingly, four FA patients harbored multiple mutations in at least two FA genes, and some of these mutations have not been previously reported. These patients' clinical manifestations were vastly different from each other, as were their treatment responses to androstanazol and prednisone. This finding suggests that heterozygous mutation(s) in FA genes could also have diverse biological and/or pathophysiological effects on FA patients or FA gene carriers.

"Blood transfusionhas been considered as a risk factor for postoperative infection after major surgery. However, the relationship between perioperative blood transfusion and the development of serious infections after pancreaticoduodenectomy remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to analyze risk factors associated with postoperative serious infections following pancreaticoduodenectomy. We conducted a retrospective study of 212 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy during past 2 years and assessed the risk factors for serious infectious complications. Serious infections developed in 61 patients (29 %) including 47 cases of surgical site infection (SSI), 19 cases of bacteremia, and 13 cases of pneumonia. One patient died of severe septic shock. A multivariate logistic regression analysis of perioperative factors identified that pancreatic fistula (P < 0.01, OR = 9.763) and blood transfusion (P < 0.01, OR = 3.216) were significant risk factors for serious infections.

"To investigate if galectin-3: (1) enhances adhesion of rat corneal epithelial cells onto a collagen IV substrate and (2) promotes wound healing in rat corneal explants. Primary cultures of rat corneal epithelial cells were fixed and immunostained with galectin-3 antibody. To test cellular adherence onto plates coated with collagen type IV, isolated corneal epithelial cells from rats were cultured for 24 h with or without recombinant galectin-3. The attached cells were counted after fixing and staining with 0.1% crystal violet. Direct binding of galectin-3 to collagen IV was tested using a biotin label transfer method. To evaluate wound healing, explants with a 3.5-mm diameter wound in the central corneal epithelium from rats were incubated for 16 h with or without recombinant galectin-3. Changes in the size of the wound were measured with a digital microscope after staining with 5% fluorescein sodium.

"Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) preconditioning (PC) allows brain protection against transient global ischemia. In the present study, we hypothesize that the mechanism of HBO-PC involves the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in cerebral tissues before ischemia, which leads to a suppression of COX-2 and its downstream targets after global ischemic insult. One hundred twenty-nine male Sprague Dawley rats (body weight 280-300 grams) were allocated to the naive control group and the sham operation group, and 3 groups of animals were subjected to 15-minute 4-vessel occlusion: untreated, preconditioned with HBO 2.5 atmospheres absolutes for 1 hour daily for 5 days, preconditioned as mentioned and administered with COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (1 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneal) before each preconditioning session, and normal rats preconditioned with HBO without ischemia. The mortality, the incidence of seizures, and T-maze scores were recorded. The quantitative cell count in Nissl stain and TUNEL was conducted on day 7 after ischemia. The brain expression of COX-2 was analyzed with Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. HBO-PC increased the number of surviving neurons in the Cornu Ammonis area 1, which was associated with the reduced COX-2 expression in the hippocampus and in the cerebral cortex at 1 and 3 days after ischemia.

"Early acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most serious and common complications in the early stage of severe burns, but the pathological mechanisms still need to be elucidated. High uric acid (UA) has been found to be correlated with renal dysfunction in some experimental and clinical studies; however, the study of the dynamic correlation between AKI and UA in severe burns is still lacking. The diagnosis and classification of AKI were performed according to RIFLE criteria, UA, serum creatinine (Scr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactic acid (LA) were dynamically monitored within 2 days after injury in 59 severely burned patients. Within 2 days after injury, AKI occurred in 23 of 59 patients (risk in 12 cases, injury in seven cases and failure in four cases), UA level in AKI patients was significantly higher than that in No-AKI patients, and referring to the cutoff level of UA (375.5 μmol/l) from ROC curve for predicting AKI, the abnormal increase of UA levels was earlier than acute deterioration of renal function in most of the AKI patients after injury. Among AKI patients, the Scr/eGFR levels were closely related to UA levels for 2 days after injury. Moreover, UA level in cases with severe grade of AKI was significantly higher than that in those with less severe grade of AKI.

Two weeks HFD reduced the numbers of GLP-1 positive cells in the colon, and of GIP positive cells in the small intestine. Purified small intestinal L-cells showed major shifts in their gene expression profiles. In mice on HFD for 16 weeks, significant reductions were observed in the expression of L-cell specific genes, including those encoding gut hormones (Gip, Cck, Sct, Nts), prohormone processing enzymes (Pcsk1, Cpe), granins (Chgb, Scg2), nutrient sensing machinery (Slc5a1, Slc15a1, Abcc8, Gpr120) and enteroendocrine-specific transcription factors (Etv1, Isl1, Mlxipl, Nkx2.2 and Rfx6).

"To identify the molecular basis of a demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1) with presumed autosomal recessive inheritance. CMT1, an inherited motor and sensory neuropathy with low nerve conduction velocities, is caused by dominantly inherited mutations in the genes of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), myelin protein zero (MPZ/P(0)), and early growth response 2 transcription factor (EGR2/Krox-20). Two young sisters born of clinically and electrophysiologically healthy parents had a severe CMT1 neuropathy of presumed autosomal recessive inheritance. The older sister underwent a nerve biopsy. The authors analyzed PMP22, MPZ/P(0), and EGR2/Krox-20 by automated direct nucleotide sequencing. For rapid mutation detection, they determined the restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms for TaqI in the fluorescein-labeled target DNA sequence amplified by PCR. Nerve biopsy disclosed a demyelinating and remyelinating neuropathy with onion bulb formations. Both sisters had a novel heterozygous G308-->A transition of MPZ/P(0) without any mutation of PMP22 or EGR2/Krox-20. The G308-->A transition was a nonconservative mutation that changed a glycine into a glutamate at the amino acid residue 74 in the extracellular domain of the mature MPZ/P(0). None of 50 healthy controls had the mutation. The healthy mother had a low amount of the mutation in blood (congruent with 20%) as well as in skin, buccal epithelium, and hairs (30%).

"Application of emerging molecular MRI techniques, including chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)-MRI, to cardiac imaging is desirable; however, conventional methods are poorly suited for cardiac imaging, particularly in small animals with rapid heart rates. We developed a CEST-encoded steady state and retrospectively gated cardiac cine imaging sequence in which the presence of fibrosis or paraCEST contrast agents was directly encoded into the steady-state myocardial signal intensity (cardioCEST). Development of cardioCEST: A CEST-encoded cardiac cine MRI sequence was implemented on a 9.4T small animal scanner. CardioCEST of fibrosis was serially performed by acquisition of a series of CEST-encoded cine images at multiple offset frequencies in mice (n=7) after surgically induced myocardial infarction. Scar formation was quantified using a spectral modeling approach and confirmed with histological staining. Separately, circulatory redistribution kinetics of the paramagnetic CEST agent Eu-HPDO3A were probed in mice using cardioCEST imaging, revealing rapid myocardial redistribution, and washout within 30 minutes (n=6). Manipulation of vascular tone resulted in heightened peak CEST contrast in the heart, but did not alter redistribution kinetics (n=6).

"The pathogenesis of high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is considered an altered permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier secondary to intense pulmonary vasoconstriction and high capillary pressure, but previous bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) findings in well-established HAPE are also consistent with inflammatory etiologic characteristics. To determine whether inflammation is a primary event in HAPE and to define the temporal sequence of events in HAPE.

Pulmonary artery pressure measurements and BAL findings at low altitude (490 m) and shortly before or at the onset of HAPE at an altitude of 4559 m. Subjects who were HAPE susceptible had higher mean (SD) pulmonary artery systolic blood pressures at 4559 m compared with HAPE-resistant subjects (66 vs 37 mm Hg; P =.004). Despite development of HAPE in the majority of HAPE-susceptible subjects, there were no differences in BAL fluid total leukocyte counts between resistant and susceptible subjects or between counts taken at low and high altitudes. Subjects who developed HAPE had BAL fluid with high concentrations of plasma-derived proteins and erythrocytes, but there was no increase in plasma concentrations of surfactant protein A and Clara cell protein. The chest radiograph score was 12.7 for the 3 HAPE-susceptible subjects who developed HAPE before BAL was performed; they were lavaged within 3 to 5 hours. The remainder of the HAPE-susceptible group was lavaged before edema was apparent on radiographs. However, 6 subjects from the HAPE-susceptible group who developed HAPE on the following day had a score on bronchoscopy of 1.5, which increased to 4.6, reflective of mild pulmonary edema.

"This study explores recent claims that humans exhibit minimum cost of transport (CoTmin) for running, which occurs at intermediate speed, and assesses individual physiological, gait, and training characteristics. Twelve healthy participants with varying levels of fitness and running experience ran on a treadmill at six self-selected speeds in a discontinuous protocol over three sessions. Running speed (km·h), VO2 (mL·kg·km), CoT (kcal·km), HR (bpm), and cadence (steps per minute) were continuously measured. VO2max was measured on the fourth testing session. The occurrence of CoTmin was investigated, and its presence or absence was examined with respect to fitness, gait, and training characteristics. Five participants showed clear CoTmin at intermediate speed and a statistically significant (P < 0.05) quadratic CoT-speed function, whereas the other participants did not show such evidence. Participants were then categorized and compared with respect to the strength of evidence for CoTmin (ClearCoTmin and NoCoTmin).

"Chemotherapy-related hepatic dysfunction affected the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, predictive factors of chemotherapy-related hepatic dysfunction remained undefined. To identify the predictive factors for hepatic dysfunction during cytotoxic chemotherapy in Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with advanced NSCLC who received cytotoxic chemotherapy at Division of Respiratory Medicine, the affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University, from July 2012 to January 2015. We investigated the incidence of hepatic dysfunction during chemotherapy and evaluated several clinical factors that are associated with hepatic dysfunction, including body mass index (BMI) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). A total of 116 patients were enrolled in study, 54 patients (46.57%) experienced hepatic dysfunction after receiving chemotherapy.

"Apigenin is a non-toxic natural flavonoid that is abundantly present in common fruits and vegetables. It has been reported that apigenin has various beneficial health effects such as anti-inflammation and chemoprevention. Multiple studies have shown that inflammation is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis, diabetes, sepsis, various liver diseases, and other metabolic diseases. Although it has been long realized that apigenin has anti-inflammatory activities, the underlying functional mechanisms are still not fully understood. In the present study, we examined the effect of apigenin on LPS-induced inflammatory response and further elucidated the potential underlying mechanisms in human THP-1-induced macrophages and mouse J774A.1 macrophages. By using the PrimePCR array, we were able to identify the major target genes regulated by apigenin in LPS-mediated immune response. The results indicated that apigenin significantly inhibited LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α through modulating multiple intracellular signaling pathways in macrophages. Apigenin inhibited LPS-induced IL-1β production by inhibiting caspase-1 activation through the disruption of the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly.

"Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) of the breast typically presents with clinical biomarkers consistent with a favorable response to endocrine therapies, and over 90 % of ILC cases express the estrogen receptor (ER). However, a subset of ILC cases may be resistant to endocrine therapies, suggesting that ER biology is unique in ILC. Using ILC cell lines, we previously demonstrated that ER regulates a distinct gene expression program in ILC cells, and we hypothesized that these ER-driven pathways modulate the endocrine response in ILC. One potential novel pathway is via the Wnt ligand WNT4, a critical signaling molecule in mammary gland development regulated by the progesterone receptor. The ILC cell lines MDA-MB-134-VI, SUM44PE, and BCK4 were used to assess WNT4 gene expression and regulation, as well as the role of WNT4 in estrogen-regulated proliferation. To assess these mechanisms in the context of endocrine resistance, we developed novel ILC endocrine-resistant long-term estrogen-deprived (ILC-LTED) models. ILC and ILC-LTED cell lines were used to identify upstream regulators and downstream signaling effectors of WNT4 signaling. ILC cells co-opted WNT4 signaling by placing it under direct ER control. We observed that ER regulation of WNT4 correlated with use of an ER binding site at the WNT4 locus, specifically in ILC cells. Further, WNT4 was required for endocrine response in ILC cells, as WNT4 knockdown blocked estrogen-induced proliferation. ILC-LTED cells remained dependent on WNT4 for proliferation, by either maintaining ER function and WNT4 regulation or uncoupling WNT4 from ER and upregulating WNT4 expression. In the latter case, WNT4 expression was driven by activated nuclear factor kappa-B signaling in ILC-LTED cells. In ILC and ILC-LTED cells, WNT4 led to suppression of CDKN1A/p21, which is critical for ILC cell proliferation. CDKN1A knockdown partially reversed the effects of WNT4 knockdown.",Does wNT4 mediate estrogen receptor signaling and endocrine resistance in invasive lobular carcinoma cell lines?,"WNT4 drives a novel signaling pathway in ILC cells, with a critical role in estrogen-induced growth that may also mediate endocrine resistance.

"The T cell-specific T-box transcription factor (TBX21) plays a crucial role in the regulation of the immune system because this factor induces the differentiation of T(H)1 and blocks T(H)2 commitment together with the homeobox transcription factor HLX1. The role of genetic variants in TBX21 alone and in combination with HLX1 polymorphisms was investigated in the development of T(H)2-associated atopy and asthma. The TBX21 gene was resequenced in 37 adult volunteers. Polymorphisms identified were genotyped in a cross-sectional (N = 3099) and nested asthma case-control population (N = 1872) using mainly matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Effects of promoter polymorphisms on TBX21 gene expression were studied by reporter gene assays.

"To investigate the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the responses of rats to a prolonged doxorubicin (DOX) treatment. Male Wistar rats were used. DOX was administered by intraperitoneal injections of seven doses (cumulative dose was 15 mg/kg). Control animals were treated with saline. Tissue or plasma samples were collected at four and eight weeks after the application of the last dose. Protein levels were determined by immunoblot assay, and MMP activities were measured by gelatin zymography. Superoxide content was analyzed using a lucigenin chemiluminescence assay and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities with a SOD assay kit. Qualitative structural alterations of the heart were characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Systolic blood pressure was higher in DOX-treated rats as compared with the control rats at 8 weeks after treatment. In contrast, there were no differences in the heart rate between the control and DOX-treated rats. DOX treatment caused marked heterogeneous subcellular alterations of cardiomyocytes and structural disorganizations of the cardiac extracellular space. The effects of DOX were linked to a stimulation of plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities that had already increased by 4 weeks after the end of the treatment. In the left ventricle, however, DOX only led to increased MMP-2 activation at 8 weeks after the end of treatment.

"Benefits to crop productivity arising from increasing CO2 fertilization may be offset by detrimental effects of global climate change, such as an increasing frequency of drought. Phosphorus (P) nutrition plays an important role in crop responses to water stress, but how elevated CO2 (eCO2) and P nutrition interact, especially in legumes, is unclear. This study aimed to elucidate whether P supply improves plant drought tolerance under eCO2. A soil-column experiment was conducted in a free air CO2 enrichment (SoilFACE) system. Field pea (Pisum sativum) was grown in a P-deficient vertisol, supplied with 15 mg P kg(-1) (deficient) or 60 mg P kg(-1) (adequate for crop growth) and exposed to ambient CO2 (aCO2; 380-400 ppm) or eCO2 (550-580 ppm). Drought treatments commenced at flowering. Measurements were taken of soil and leaf water content, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, total soluble sugars and inorganic P content (Pi). Water-use efficiency was greatest under eCO2 when the plants were supplied with adequate P compared with other treatments irrespective of drought treatment. Elevated CO2 decreased stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, and increased the concentration of soluble sugars and relative water contents in leaves. Adequate P supply increased concentrations of soluble sugars and Pi in drought-stressed plants. Adequate P supply but not eCO2 increased root length distribution in deeper soil layers.",Do phosphorus application and elevated CO2 enhance drought tolerance in field pea grown in a phosphorus-deficient vertisol?,"Phosphorus application and eCO2 interactively enhanced periodic drought tolerance in field pea as a result of decreased stomatal conductance, deeper rooting and high Pi availability for carbon assimilation in leaves.",1,1.

"The aim of this study was to suggest a clinical guideline to properly position immediate implant placement in the anterior maxillary area. The computed tomography (CT) records of 250 patients (125 males, 125 females; mean age 49.5 years) were evaluated, and the relationship of the sagittal root positions of the maxillary central incisor teeth to their respective alveolar bony housing was classified as buccal (B), medial (M), or palatal (P). Then, the clinical guideline was suggested based on the implications derived from the classification. In the second investigation, the validity of the clinical guideline was confirmed by CT analysis. First, a reference line was defined using soft tissue landmarks. Then, a virtual rectangle representing the dental implant was created and merged on the CT image, symbolizing the space where the dental implant would be positioned. The rectangular frame was positioned on the image in accordance with the guideline. The frame on the image was thoroughly assessed to detect the possibility of perforation of the labial plate. The location of the initial drilling access on the respective crown was determined by extending the longitudinal axis of the frame in a coronal direction. Of the 250 samples, 94.0% were classified as type B. Type M and P represented 5.6% and 0.4% of the samples, respectively. In 82.0% of the samples, the frame was safely positioned, not contacting the labial or palatal cortical plate in the alveolar bony housing. Moreover, when a frame representing a tapered implant form with an apical diameter of 3.5 mm was applied, 98.8% of samples were positioned safely in the alveolar bony housing.

"To determine whether statin use at time of surgery is associated with survival following nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Statins are thought to exhibit a protective effect on cancer incidence and possibly cancer survival in a number of malignancies. To date, no studies have shown an independent association between statin use and mortality in RCC. A retrospective cohort study of 916 patients who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy for RCC from 2000 to 2010 at a single institution was performed. Primary outcomes were overall (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Univariable survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier and the log-rank methods. Multivariable analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model. The predictive discrimination of the models was assessed using the Harrell c-index. The median follow-up of the entire cohort was 42.5 months. The 3-year OS estimate was 83.1% (95% CI: 77.6%-87.3%) for statin users and 77.3% (95% CI: 73.7%-80.6%) for nonstatin users (P = 0.53). The 3-year DSS was 90.9% (95% CI: 86.3%-94.0%) for statin users and 83.5% (95% CI: 80.1%-86.3%) for nonstatin users (P = 0.015).

"Atherosclerosis is the major cause of death. The most common risk factors are hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and other factors like chronic infection and inflammation. This study was undertaken to assess the effect of sitagliptin on atherosclerosis via interfering with inflammatory and oxidative pathways. A total of 18 local domestic male rabbits were included in this study. The animals were randomly divided into three groups (6 rabbits in each group): Group I normal were fed with chow (oxiod) diet for 12 weeks. Group II were fed with 1% cholesterol enriched diet for 12 weeks. Group III rabbits fed with cholesterol enriched diet for 6 weeks, and then continued on cholesterol enriched diet and treated with sitagliptin 125 mg/kg/day orally for the next 6 weeks. Blood samples were collected at the start of the study, at 6 weeks of the study and then at the end of treatment to measure serum lipids profile, hsCRP and TNFα. At end of the study, the aorta was removed for measurement of MDA, glutathione and, aortic intima-media thickness. Sitagliptin results in a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in serum level of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and TNFα with a significant increase (p < 0.05) in serum HDL level.

"Our objectives were to determine if: (1) patients with migraine have B wave abnormalities in comparison to normal controls and patients with chronic tension headache and (2) patients with chronic tension headache have an imbalance in autonomic activity that is reflected in differences in Mayer wave activity in comparison to normal controls. B waves and Mayer waves are spontaneous oscillations in cerebral blood flow velocity with a frequency of 0.5 to 3 or 4 to 7 cycles per minute, respectively, and can be measured by transcranial Doppler sonography. There is experimental evidence that B waves are generated by certain brain stem nuclei which modulate the lumen of the small intracerebral vessels via monoaminergic nerve endings. In contrast, Mayer waves in cerebral blood flow velocity have no central generator but mirror the Mayer waves in arterial blood pressure which represent peripheral autonomic activity. Migraine may be attributed to a neurotransmitter imbalance in brain stem nuclei. Dysfunctions of the peripheral autonomic nervous system are known in patients with chronic tension headache. Using bilateral transcranial Doppler monitoring of the middle cerebral artery B waves and Mayer waves were studied in 30 patients with migraine without aura, 28 subjects with tension-type headache, and 30 normal controls. Coefficient of variation as a quantitative parameter for amplitude of waves and the mean frequency were calculated from the envelope curves of the Doppler spectra. The coefficient of variation of B waves was higher in migrainous patients compared with patients with tension-type headache and normal controls (P<.05), indicating an increase in activity of brain stem nuclei in migraine only. Patients with chronic tension headaches had lower values for Mayer wave activity in comparison with normal controls (P<.05), a sign of an impairment of sympathetic activity.",Do spontaneous oscillations in cerebral blood flow velocity give evidence of different autonomic dysfunctions in various types of headache?,"Our data support the dysfunction of the brain stem monoaminergic/serotonergic system in migraine.

"American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) anatomic stage group is considered relatively nondiscriminatory for predicting differences in survival after pancreatectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma, a perception confirmed in the authors' patients and by other reports. The authors' aim was to investigate the potential for improving the predictive value of AJCC staging by incorporating individually predictive histologic features into AJCC tumor-node-metastasis classification of anatomic extent, and determine the simplest combination of tumor characteristics predicting survival. The authors determined survival of 137 patients who underwent pancreatectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma with curative intent (stage Groups IA-IIB) at Moffitt Cancer Center during the last 2 decades using data obtained from medical record review, the Moffitt Cancer Registry, and the Social Security Death Index. Histologic characteristics were confirmed by expert review. Median survival was 21.2 months after pancreatectomy with a 3-year disease-specific survival of 36%. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazard modeling found worse survival with local extrapancreatic extension, poorly differentiated histology, and lymphatic invasion within tumor (P<.05). Survival was not worse with nodal metastases, microscopically positive resection margins, and perineural or venous invasion, nor was survival better with cancer arising from an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Kaplan-Meier estimates for different variable combinations showed prognosis was best for well- or moderately differentiated tumors without lymphatic invasion and confined to the pancreas (9.9 years median survival), worst for poorly differentiated tumors with lymphatic invasion and local extension beyond the pancreas (8.5 months median survival), and intermediate for well- or moderately differentiated tumors with either lymphatic invasion or local extension beyond the pancreas (21.2 months median survival).",Do histologic characteristics enhance predictive value of American Joint Committee on Cancer staging in resectable pancreas cancer?,"A simple combination of tumor differentiation, lymphatic invasion within the tumor, and local extrapancreatic extension predicts survival after pancreatectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma.",1,Do histopathological features improve the prognostic accuracy of AJCC staging in operable pancreatic cancer?,20.0,2873.0,3032.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.5671091079711914,1.882674217224121,4.4984519481658936,"Yes, incorporating histologic characteristics enhances the predictive value of American Joint Committee on Cancer staging in resectable pancreatic cancer, as certain features like local extrapancreatic extension, poorly differentiated histology, and lymphatic invasion are associated with worse survival outcomes.",1.0
"Microglial cells have been implicated in neuroinflammation-mediated injury in the brain, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as cerebral palsy (CP) and autism. Pro-inflammatory activation of microglial cells results in the impairment of their neuroprotective functions, leading to an exaggerated, ongoing immune dysregulation that can persist long after the initial insult. We have previously shown that dendrimer-mediated delivery of an anti-inflammatory agent can attenuate inflammation in a rabbit model of maternal inflammation-induced CP and significantly improve the motor phenotype, due to the ability of the dendrimer to selectively localize in activated microglia. To elucidate the interactions between dendrimers and microglia, we created an organotypic whole-hemisphere brain slice culture model from newborn rabbits with and without exposure to inflammation in utero. We then used this model to analyze the dynamics of microglial migration and their interactions with dendrimers in the presence of neuroinflammation. Microglial cells in animals with CP had an amoeboid morphology and impaired cell migration, demonstrated by decreased migration distance and velocity when compared to cells in healthy, age-matched controls. However, this decreased migration was associated with a greater, more rapid dendrimer uptake compared to microglial cells from healthy controls.",Are microglial migration and interactions with dendrimer nanoparticles altered in the presence of neuroinflammation?,"This study demonstrates that maternal intrauterine inflammation is associated with impaired microglial function and movement in the newborn brain.

"Chronic graft vascular disease (CGVD) in cardiac allografts has been defined as a slowly evolving vasculopathy unresponsive to conventional immunosuppression. We compared 4 rodent models of CGVD to evaluate the reproducibility of CGVD in heart allografts. Rapamycin (Rapa) and cyclosporine (CSA) were then used to treat CGVD. Hearts were harvested and placed heterotopically into allogenic recipients. CGVD scores of PVG allografts from ACI recipients treated with CSA on days 1 through 10 were significantly elevated on day 90 (n=16) compared with other models (immunosuppression used): (1) Lewis to F344 recipients (CSA), (2) Brown Norway to Lewis (FK506), and (3) DA to Wistar-Firth (methylprednisolone, azathioprine, CSA). Although delayed (day 60 to 90) CSA treatment had no effect (n=6), delayed Rapa (3 mg. kg-1. d-1 IP) reversed CGVD in PVG grafts (0.22+/-0.19 on day 90, n=6). ACI isografts showed no evidence of CGVD (n=6) at day 90.

"To examine the impact of glaucoma and visual acuity (VA) and visual field (VF) losses on psychosocial functioning (PF). Cross-sectional study. We compared PF between 192 participants with bilateral glaucoma with VA or VF losses and 40 controls from a tertiary eye hospital clinic in Singapore. Glaucoma was defined using the Hodapp-Anderson-Parish criteria. Four psychosocial outcomes of the Glaucoma Quality of Life 36 questionnaire were psychometrically assessed using Rasch analysis. Multivariate regression was performed to determine the independent impact of glaucoma and VA and VF losses on PF. The impact of VA and VF on PF were evaluated by restricted cubic spline analysis. Anxiety, self-image, psychological well-being, and confidence in health care. The mean age of participants was 66.2±11.0 years, and 63% were male. In the better eye, VA and mean deviation were Snellen 20/25 and -8.89±6.52 dB, respectively. In multivariate models, glaucoma patients had 63.0% greater anxiety (95% confidence interval [CI], -66.0% to -61.2%; P<0.001), 71.0% lower self-image (95% CI, -74.1% to -68.5%; P<0.001), 38.3% less psychological well-being (95% CI, -37.4% to -39.0%; P<0.001), and 32.4% reduced confidence in health care than patients without glaucoma. The worst VA and VF categories had the most reduced PF (range, 26.0% to 81.5%; P<0.001 for all associations) compared with controls. With worsening VA, there was a linear increase in anxiety (P=0.009) and decrease in self-image (P=0.005). With worsening VF from 0 to -12.1 dB (P=0.003), anxiety increased before plateauing.

"Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a facial dysostosis, the hallmark being bilateral malar hypoplasia. The purpose of this study is to morphologically classify the TCS malar deformity and to volumetrically characterise both the TCS zygoma and masseter muscle, including for left-right symmetry, compared to controls. We hypothesise that the TCS zygoma will be smaller than controls and zygomatic deficiency will portend masseteric hypoplasia. Demographic and computed tomography (CT) data were recorded. The CT scans were converted into three-dimensional facial renderings, and the zygomatic morphology was grossly evaluated. A classification was reported based on malar structure and presence/absence of normal zygomaticomaxillary complex articulations. The zygoma and masseter muscles were then digitally isolated using 3-D planning software (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). Volumes and sidedness ratios were calculated and compared using two-sided t-tests. 58 sides were identified (24 TCS: 34 controls), mean age of 60.0 months and normally distributed. The phenotypic dysmorphology was graded as mild, moderate or severe (I, II and III, respectively).

"To assess by Laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) skin blood perfusion of hands in patients with SSc and primary RP (PRP) at baseline and after cold stimulation (CS). In SSc patients, the associations between skin perfusion and nailfold video capillaroscopy (NVC) patterns were also evaluated. Forty patients with SSc, 38 patients with PRP and 32 healthy controls were recruited. Skin blood flow of the hands was detected by Lisca Laser Doppler Perfusion Imager at baseline and after CS. Further laser Doppler scanning was performed for each hand at 0 (T(1)), 3 (T(2)), 7 (T(3)) and 15 min (T(4)). Baseline mean perfusion is significantly (P < 0.000 l) lower in SSc patients than in healthy controls.

"Brain imaging studies have revealed abnormal function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of alcoholics that may contribute to the impulsive behavior and lack of control over drinking that characterizes this disorder. Understanding how ethanol affects the physiology of PFC neurons may help explain this loss of control and lead to better treatments for alcohol addiction. In a previous study from this laboratory, we showed that ethanol inhibits complex patterns of persistent activity (known as ""up-states"") in medial PFC (mPFC) neurons in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. In the current study, whole-cell patch clamp recordings were used to directly examine the effects of ethanol on the glutamatergic and GABAergic components that underlie persistent activity. In deep-layer mPFC pyramidal neurons, ethanol reversibly attenuated electrically evoked N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated EPSCs. Significant inhibition was observed at concentrations as low as 22 mM, equivalent to a blood ethanol concentration (0.1%) typically associated with legal limits for intoxication. In contrast to NMDA responses, neither evoked nor spontaneous EPSCs mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid-type glutamate receptor were affected by ethanol at concentrations as high as 88 mM, a concentration that can be fatal to non-tolerant individuals.

"GH replacement improves numerous metabolic abnormalities in GH-deficient patients; increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) has been observed in GH-deficient patients; however, it is unknown if LPO is influenced by GH replacement. To evaluate the extent to which GH replacement might reverse the increased LPO in GH-deficient adults and to analyse if this phenomenon might be involved in the improvement of metabolic disturbances due to GH treatment. Serum concentrations of malondialdehyde + 4-hydroxyalkenals (MDA + 4-HDA), as an index of LPO, were measured at baseline, and after 12 and 24 months of GH replacement in 40 adult patients with severe GH deficiency (both in adult- and childhood-onset) and in 40 healthy volunteers, matched for sex, age and body mass index (BMI). Correlations were evaluated between LPO and lipids, IGF-I, metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2, -9), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), BMI and GH dose. LPO values in GH-deficient patients were several-fold higher than in controls [55.36 +/- 2.27 vs. 4.19 +/- 0.42 nmol/mg protein (mean +/- SEM), P < 0.0001] and decreased significantly over time with GH replacement to 38.61 +/- 2.15 nmol/mg protein (i.e. by approximately 30%), though still remaining markedly elevated compared with controls (P < 0.0001).

"Implication of the IGF-IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) axis in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases has been well documented. It has also been shown that an adverse intrauterine environment alters the IGF-IGFBP axis during childhood. The objective of this study was to investigate whether these alterations persist into adulthood. Fasting serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and insulin concentrations were measured, and their determinants were analyzed in a cohort of young adult subjects (22 yr of age) born either small (SGA; n = 461) or appropriate (AGA; n = 568) for gestational age.

"Elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has been associated with thrombotic disorders including myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, and ischemic stroke, independent of other inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to determine whether elevated RDW is associated with cerebral infarction and poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). In this retrospective single-center cohort of aSAH patients (October 2009-September 2014), elevated RDW was defined as a mean RDW >14.5 % during the first 14 days after aSAH. Outcomes included cerebral infarction (CI) by any mechanism and poor functional outcome, defined as discharge modified Rankin Scale (mRS) >4, indicating severe disability or death. Of 179 patients, 27 % had a high Hunt-Hess grade (IV-V), and 76 % were women. Twenty-four patients (13.4 %) underwent red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and compared to patients with normal RDW, patients with an elevated RDW were at greater odds of RBC transfusion (OR 2.56 [95 % CI, 1.07-6.11], p = 0.035).

"Maternal prenatal stress during pregnancy is associated with fetal growth restriction and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, which may be mediated by impaired placental function. Imprinted genes control fetal growth, placental development, adult behaviour (including maternal behaviour) and placental lactogen production.

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by RAGE was determined by western blotting. Compared with non-diabetic controls, RAGE and S100B were significantly elevated in the diabetic retina with apparent localisation in the Müller glia, occurring concomitantly with upregulation of GFAP.

"Vitamin A deficiency is a common manifestation in cystic fibrosis (CF), but high levels of vitamin A in the liver have also been described. High levels of vitamin A in the liver are toxic, while normal levels might be protective against liver damage. In order to investigate whether liver damage in patients with CF is related to vitamin A content of the liver, vitamin A status was investigated in 15 patients with CF aged 8 to 34 years. Liver biopsy was performed on clinical indication and the vitamin A concentration in the liver was determined as retinylpalmitate. Serum levels of retinol and retinol-binding protein were investigated on the morning of the biopsy. Eight patients had morphologic signs of cirrhosis. Eight patients had been on treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid for 1 to 3 years. All but three patients had been on vitamin A supplementation for years. Five patients had serum concentrations of retinol below the reference range and seven patients had decreased serum levels of retinol-binding protein. There was a strong correlation between serum levels of retinol and retinol-binding protein (rs = 0.90, p = 0.01), but no correlations with age, Shwachamn score, or genotype. Six of the patients had vitamin A concentrations in the liver < 40 micrograms/g wet weight, and the concentrations decreased significantly with age (rs = 0.77, p = 0.01), without correlation to clinical score or liver disease.

"The mortality associated with repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAA) remains obstinately high and many deaths result from multiple organ failure which is likely to be related to splanchnic ischaemia. The aim of this study is to investigate the importance of splanchnic ischaemia in determining outcome from RAAA by comparing gastric intramucosal pH with other methods of assessing the adequacy of splanchnic oxygenation. Prospective cohort of patients following surgery for RAAA admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Guy's Hospital, London. Gastric intramucosal pH (pHim) and global haemodynamic, oxygen transport and metabolic variables were measured on admission, at 12 h and at 24 h after admission. Results were compared between survivors and non-survivors and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to assess the ability of each measurement to predict outcome. The median 24 h APACHE II was 18 and the ICU mortality 45.5%. Gastric pHim was significantly higher in survivors than non-survivors at 24 h (7.42 vs. 7.24, p < 0.01). In survivors who had a low intramucosal pH (pHim) on admission there was a significant improvement over the first 24 h (7.26 to 7.40, p < 0.05), whereas in patients who subsequently died, and had a normal pHim on admission, there was a significant fall in pHim (7.35 to 7.16, p < 0.05).

"Recombinant IGF-I is now available for the treatment of GH insensitivity (Laron syndrome). We have determined the effects of IGF-I on soft connective tissue and bone metabolism in a group of patients with this disorder. Thirteen patients with Laron syndrome (LS) (8 children and 5 adults) were included in the study. The children with LS were treated with IGF-I for 3 years with daily doses of 150-200 micrograms/kg. The adult LS patients were treated for 9 months with daily doses of 50-120 micrograms/kg. Blood samples for procollagens were collected before, during and at the end of IGF-I treatment. Serum levels of the carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP), the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) and of the pyridinoline cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) were determined before and during IGF-I administration. Untreated patients with LS had lower than normal serum levels of PICP and PIIINP for age.

"RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE6 (RDR6) and SUPPRESSOR of GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3) are required for DNA methylation and post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mediated by 21-nt siRNAs produced by sense transgenes (S-PTGS). In contrast, RDR2, but not RDR6, is required for DNA methylation and TGS mediated by 24-nt siRNAs, and for cell-to-cell spreading of IR-PTGS mediated by 21-nt siRNAs produced by inverted repeat transgenes under the control of a phloem-specific promoter. In this study, we examined the role of RDR2 and RDR6 in S-PTGS. Unlike RDR6, RDR2 is not required for DNA methylation of transgenes subjected to S-PTGS. RDR6 is essential for the production of siRNAs by transgenes subjected to S-PTGS, but RDR2 also contributes to the production of transgene siRNAs when RDR6 is present because rdr2 mutations reduce transgene siRNA accumulation. However, the siRNAs produced via RDR2 likely are counteractive in wildtype plants because impairement of RDR2 increases S-PTGS efficiency at a transgenic locus that triggers limited silencing, and accelerates S-PTGS at a transgenic locus that triggers efficient silencing.",Does rDR2 partially antagonize the production of RDR6-dependent siRNA in sense transgene-mediated PTGS?,"These results suggest that RDR2 and RDR6 compete for RNA substrates produced by transgenes subjected to S-PTGS.

"Liver fibrosis and subsequent cirrhosis is a major cause of death worldwide, but few effective antifibrotic therapies are reported. Whey-hydrolyzed peptide (WHP), a major peptide component of bovine milk, exerts anti-inflammatory effects in experimental models. A WHP-enriched diet is widely used for immunomodulating diets (IMD) in clinical fields. However, the effects of WHP on liver fibrosis remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the antifibrotic effects of WHP in a rat cirrhosis model. Progressive liver fibrosis was induced by repeated intraperitoneal administration of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) for 3 wk. Rats were fed either a WHP-enriched IMD (WHP group) or a control enteral diet (control group). The degree of liver fibrosis was compared between groups. Hepatocyte-protective effects were examined using hepatocytes isolated from rats fed a WHP diet. Reactive oxygen species and glutathione in liver tissue were investigated in the DMN cirrhosis model. Macroscopic and microscopic progression of liver fibrosis was remarkably suppressed in the WHP group. Elevated serum levels of liver enzymes and hyaluronic acid, and liver tissue hydroxyproline content were significantly attenuated in the WHP group.

"Recent advances in adrenergic pharmacology have made possible the identification of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes using the specific blockers chloroethylclonidine and WB 4101. In the present study, we used these two blockers to determine the mechanisms responsible for automatic rhythms occurring during simulated ischemia and reperfusion of isolated canine Purkinje fibers. Experiments were done in the presence of propranolol to minimize beta-adrenergic contributions to the rhythms studied. In the control situation, all fibers showed membrane potentials greater than -90 mV and normal automatic rhythms. During simulated ischemia, membrane potential depolarized to the -60 mV range. Abnormal automaticity was seen in 20% of fibers not treated with phenylephrine and in 50% of those superfused with 1 x 10(-7) M phenylephrine. The incidence of abnormal automaticity was reduced to 0% by WB 4101 (which blocks phosphoinositide metabolic effects of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in the heart) and was increased to 90% by chloroethylclonidine (which blocks Na-K pump-stimulating effects of alpha-agonists). Moreover, the ischemic fibers were significantly more hyperpolarized during superfusion with WB 4101 than with chloroethylclonidine.

"Methamphetamine (MA) use is a growing public health concern in many settings around the world. While some physical and mental health effects associated with injection MA use have been well described, little is known about the relationship between injecting MA and suicidal behavior. We sought to determine whether MA injection was associated with an increased risk of attempting suicide among a prospective cohort of injection drug users (IDUs) in Vancouver, Canada. Between 2001 and 2008, eligible participants enrolled in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS) completed semi-annual questionnaires that elicited information regarding sociodemographics, drug use patterns, and mental health problems including suicidal behavior. We used Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates to determine whether self-reported MA injection was an independent predictor of attempting suicide at subsequent time points.

"Epidemiological evidence implicates a heightened androgenic state in women with epithelial ovarian cancer. Androgen activity may be modulated by altered expression or activity of the androgen receptor (AR) or AR polymorphisms.

Differential expression of AR mRNA and protein was examined in 46 primary cultures of normal human ovarian surface epithelium (HOSE) and malignant Cedars-Sinai ovarian cancer (CSOC) ovarian epithelial cells. AR allele length was characterized by genotyping in 77 ovarian cancer specimens. AR mRNA expression was higher in CSOC primary cultures (1.58 +/- 0.17) when compared with HOSE (1 +/- 0.09, P = 0.005), but protein expression was not statistically different.

"Neuregulins are growth factors that are essential for myogenesis and regulate muscle metabolism. The addition of a recombinant neuregulin-1 isoform, heregulin-beta1(177-244) (Hrg), containing 3 nmol/l of the bioactive epidermal growth factor-like domain, to developing L6E9 myocytes has acute and chronic effects on glucose uptake and enhances myogenesis. Here, we studied the metabolic adaptation of myocytes to chronic treatments with Hrg. L6E9 and C2C12 myocytes were chronically treated with low concentrations of Hrg (3 pmol/l) that do not induce myogenesis. We analyzed the effects of Hrg on cellular oxidative metabolism and insulin sensitivity and explored the mechanisms of action. Hrg increased the cell content of GLUT4 without affecting basal glucose uptake. Glucose and palmitate oxidation increased in Hrg-treated cells, whereas lactate release decreased. Hrg increased the abundance of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits, enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential, and induced the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma coactivator1alpha and PPARdelta. Furthermore, we identified PPARdelta as an essential mediator of the stimulatory effects of Hrg on the expression of OXPHOS subunits.

"In the 1990s, sequential atrio-ventricular pacing demonstrated haemodynamic benefit relative to right ventricular pacing in patients with sinus rhythm requiring pacing post cardiopulmonary bypass. The benefit of biventricular pacing has been demonstrated in non-surgical patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. It was hypothesised that left ventricular pacing would increase cardiac output in surgical patients. We report the findings of a prospective trial of left ventricular pacing with active lead placement on the anterior or posterior left ventricular surface, compared to standard practice of active lead placement on the right ventricular surface. Twenty five patients with left ventricular dysfunction underwent pacing with active lead placement on the right ventricle (control), the anterior left ventricle and the posterior left ventricle in random order, with each pacing mode of 10 min duration, following cardiopulmonary bypass. Haemodynamic parameters were measured with a thermodilution pulmonary artery catheter. Patients provided their control values. In the 25 patients studied, pacing with the active lead posteriorly on the left ventricle increased cardiac index from 2.74 to 3.08 l/min per m2 (P=0.019). Significant increases in mean arterial pressure with the use of this pacing mode were observed.

"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative immunonutrition pharmaceutics (IMPACT) diet versus standard enteral nutrition (EN) on the nutritional status and immunity of patients with colorectal or gastrointestinal (GI) cancer and to evaluate whether it influences the incidence of postoperative complication. Sixty patients with GI cancer were randomly divided into 2 groups, immunonutrition (IM) and control diet (CT), each of which was fed with IMPACT and conventional diet, respectively, for 7 days before surgical procedures. Variables of nutritional status and immunity, postoperative complications, infections, and the days of postoperative hospitalization were measured. There were no significant differences in the immunological and nutritional variables between the 2 groups preoperatively. The incidence of postoperative complications was significantly lower and the days of postoperative hospitalization were significantly decreased in the IM group. Serum concentrations of both prealbumin (PALB) and transferrin (TRF) were lower in the IM than in the CT group on postoperative day 3 (P<0.01). TRF continued to be significantly lower in the CT group than in the IM group between day 4 and day 7.

"Fatty acids can modulate lipid metabolism, this is related to insulin resistance (IR). This study evaluated the relationship of plasma fatty acid profile with IR, fuel oxidative metabolism and plasma lipid concentration in 'healthy' women. Sixteen 'healthy', sedentary and non-obese women were evaluated under fasting conditions for fuel oxidation, plasma fatty acid profile, free fatty acids, triglycerides, glucose and insulin concentrations. IR, fuel oxidation and plasma lipids were measured under insulin-stimulated conditions. Using the Spearman test the correlation between relevant variables was assessed. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was done to identify the main clinical/metabolic and fatty acid determinants of IR. Plasma arachidonic acid content (%) determined IR, and in combination with insulin-stimulated plasma triglyceride concentration explained 45% of the IR variance. IR was inversely related to physical fitness (rs = -0.48, p = 0.01).

"Although late preconditioning protects against stunning following several short periods of ischemia-reperfusion, it is not clear if it confers protection against stunning and malignant arrhythmias after a sustained reversible ischemia, and whether KATP channels are involved as triggers and/or end effectors of the protective mechanism. The purpose of this work was thus to test these issues in conscious sheep. Five groups were considered: CONT (control): the animals were submitted to 12 min ischemia followed by 2 h reperfusion; SWOP (late preconditioning): on the first day, the animals were preconditioned with 6 periods of 5 min ischemia 5 min reperfusion and 24 h later they were submitted to 12 min ischemia followed by 2 h reperfusion; GLIB: same as CONT with the KATP channel inhibitor glibenclamide (0.4 mg/kg) infused 30 min prior to the 12 min ischemia; SWOPG2: same as SWOP with glibenclamide before the 12 min ischemia; SWOPG1: same as SWOP with glibenclamide prior to the preconditioning stimulus. Percent reperfusion recovery of wall thickening fraction (% WTh) showed late preconditioning protection against stunning throughout reperfusion (SWOP vs CONT, p < 0.01). Arrhythmia severity index (ASI) also demonstrated that late preconditioning protects against malignant arrhythmias at the onset of reperfusion (CONT: 4.87 +/- 1.62 vs SWOP: 1.39 +/- 0.93, p < 0.01). Glibenclamide was unable to prevent preconditioning, both against stunning and arrhythmia incidence, when administered either before the preconditioning stimulus (SWOPG1 vs CONT, p < 0.01) or before the sustained ischemia (SWOPG2 vs GLI, p < 0.01).",Do aTP-sensitive potassium channels have a main role in mediating late preconditioning protection against arrhythmias and stunning in conscious sheep?,"Results indicate that late preconditioning protects against stunning and arrhythmias following a reversible, sustained ischemia in conscious sheep and that KATP channel participation is negligible as triggers and end effectors of both types of protection.",1,Are ATP-sensitive potassium channels crucial for facilitating late preconditioning's protective effects against arrhythmias and cardiac stunning in awake sheep?,25.0,2747.0,2923.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.7816262245178225,2.2003114223480225,5.1641881465911865,"No, ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels do not have a main role in mediating late preconditioning protection against arrhythmias and stunning in conscious sheep, as glibenclamide, a KATP channel inhibitor, did not prevent the protective effects of late preconditioning.",1.0

"There is no adequate explanation for gender-based differences in rates of mortality and of deterioration in pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. One potential explanation is that gender hormones (sex steroids) may modulate the severity of CF lung disease, the principal cause of mortality in CF, by altering respiratory transepithelial ion transport. To determine whether respiratory epithelial ion transport varied during the menstrual cycle of CF females. The nasal transepithelial electrical potential difference (NPD) was determined as a measure of ion transport across human respiratory epithelium, coincident with measurements of endogenous serum hormone levels in the luteal and follicular phases of the menstrual cycle in CF females aged 16-22 years. The component of the NPD that is insensitive to the Na(+) transport blocker amiloride, but not the amiloride-sensitive component, changed in association with endogenous, menstrual cycle-induced changes in serum levels of progesterone and estrogen (P=0.02, n=7, paired t-test).

"Alterations of gastric mucin have been postulated as important pathogenic properties of Helicobacter pylori. In this study, we investigated gastric mucin synthesis in H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa by measuring UDP-galactosyltransferase activity, a key enzyme for the synthesis of mucin, and the amount of intracellular mucin in the gastric mucosa. Gastric biopsy specimens were obtained from thirty-seven patients (20 H. pylori-positive and 17 H. pylori-negative). UDP-galactosyltransferase activity of the biopsy specimens was measured by an assay system we had developed, using a peanut agglutinin lectin. The amount of intracellular mucin in the gastric epithelial cells was analyzed by measuring the cells' periodic acid-Schiff-alcian blue staining-positive substances.

Information on molecular targets that may be involved in the neurotoxicity of bupivacaine is limited. Suppression of Kv3 channels has been demonstrated to result in abnormal patterns in the electroencephalogram and in seizures. Inhibition of Kv3 channels by bupivacaine may consequently contribute to its neuroexcitatory side-effects. Data on the effects of bupivacaine on these potassium channels are lacking. We therefore characterized the effects of bupivacaine on human Kv3 channels natively expressed in SH-SY5Y cells. Kv3 channels natively expressed in human SH-SY5Y cells were studied using a standard whole-cell patch-clamp protocol. Bupivacaine reversibly inhibited Kv3 channels in a concentration-dependent manner. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for conductance block was 57 microM and the Hill coefficient was close to unity. Bupivacaine accelerated macroscopic current decline by inducing inactivation-like behaviour. The midpoint of current activation was shifted to depolarized potentials in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner by a maximum of 26 mV. The IC50 was 47 microM and the Hill coefficient was 2.4. The free arterial plasma concentrations of bupivacaine that have been estimated to occur during convulsions in man would inhibit the Kv3 channels by at least 40% and would shift the midpoint of current activation by a minimum of 9 mV.,Does bupivacaine inhibit human neuronal Kv3 channels in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells?,Both inhibition of potassium channels and a depolarizing shift of their activation midpoint would increase neuronal excitability.

"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) is known to protect cells against apoptosis. We raised the hypothesis that elevated tumor tissue levels and thereby plasma levels of TIMP-1 would predict resistance to apoptosis-inducing chemotherapy. Ninety patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were included in the study. Plasma TIMP-1 and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were measured in samples obtained before the first cycle of chemotherapy. Analysis of best objective response (complete or partial response versus stable or progressive disease) showed that patients with low plasma TIMP-1 had higher probability of obtaining an objective response [odds ratio (OR), 3.5; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.4-8.5, P=0.007].

"The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) is a significant coniferous forest pest in western North America. It relies on aggregation pheromones to colonize hosts. Its three major pheromone components, trans-verbenol, exo-brevicomin, and frontalin, are thought to arise via different metabolic pathways, but the enzymes involved have not been identified or characterized. We produced ESTs from male and female midguts and associated fat bodies and used custom oligonucleotide microarrays to study gene expression patterns and thereby made preliminary identification of pheromone-biosynthetic genes. Clones from two un-normalized cDNA libraries were directionally sequenced from the 5' end to yield 11,775 ESTs following sequence cleansing. The average read length was 550 nt. The ESTs clustered into 1,201 contigs and 2,833 singlets (4,034 tentative unique genes). The ESTs are broadly distributed among GO functional groups, suggesting they reflect a broad spectrum of the transcriptome. Among the most represented genes are representatives of sugar-digesting enzymes and members of an apparently Scolytid-specific gene family of unknown function. Custom NimbleGen 4-plex arrays representing the 4,034 tentative unique genes were queried with RNA from eleven different biological states representing larvae, pupae, and midguts and associated fat bodies of unfed or fed adults.

Many proteins displayed differential expression when nuclear membrane proteome of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), fibrotic liver, and HepG2 cell line were assessed using 2-DE and ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS. From the down regulated set in HCC, we have identified for the first time a 15 KDa cytochrome b5A (CYB5A), ATP synthase subunit delta (ATPD) and Hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) with 11, 5 and 22 peptide matches respectively. Furthermore, nitrosylation studies with S-nitrosocysteine followed by immunoblotting with anti SNO-cysteine demonstrated a novel and biologically relevant post translational modification of thiols of CYB5A in HCC specimens only. Immunofluorescence images demonstrated increased protein S-nitrosylation signals in the tumor cells and fibrotic region of HCC tissues. The two other nuclear membrane proteins which were only found to be nitrosylated in case of HCC were up regulated ATP synthase subunit beta (ATPB) and down regulated HBB. The decrease in expression of CYB5A in HCC suggests their possible role in disease progression. Further insight of the functional association of the identified proteins was obtained through KEGG/ REACTOME pathway analysis databases. String 8.3 interaction network shows strong interactions with proteins at high confidence score, which is helpful in characterization of functional abnormalities that may be a causative factor of liver pathology.",Does protein expression profiling of nuclear membrane protein reveal potential biomarker of human hepatocellular carcinoma?,"These findings may have broader implications for understanding the mechanism of development of carcinoma.

"Fluoroquinolones and 3rd-generation cephalosporins that are prescribed for pneumonia may be avoided and replaced by a penicillin in some cases. We aimed to determine if the proportion of patients treated for pneumonia with a cephalosporin, a fluoroquinolone or both varies among Emergency Departments (EDs), and to estimate the proportion of avoidable prescriptions. This was a retrospective study of patients treated for pneumonia in eight French EDs, and subsequently hospitalized in non-ICU wards. Third-generation cephalosporins or respiratory fluoroquinolones were presumed unavoidable if they met both criteria: (1) age ≥65 years or comorbid condition; and (2) allergy or intolerance to penicillin, or failure of penicillin, or previous treatment with penicillin, or for fluoroquinolones only, suspected legionellosis. We included 832 patients. Thirty-four percent (95 % CI, 31-38 %) of patients were treated with a cephalosporin, a respiratory fluoroquinolone or both (range among EDs 19-44 %). Four EDs were independent risk factors for prescription of a cephalosporin, a fluoroquinolone or both [adjusted OR, 2.27 (1.64-3.15)], as were immune compromise [aOR 2.54 (1.56-4.14)], antibacterial therapy started before arrival in the ED [aOR 3.32 (2.30-4.81)], REA-ICU class III or IV [aOR 1.93 (1.15-3.23)], PSI class V [aOR 1.49 (1.00-2.20)], fluid resuscitation [aOR 3.98 (2.49-6.43)] and non-invasive ventilation in the ED [aOR, 7.18 (1.7-50.1)].

"The incidence of melanoma is considerably increasing worldwide. Frequent failing of classical treatments led to development of novel therapeutic strategies aiming at managing advanced forms of this skin cancer. Additionally, the implication of the endocannabinoid system in malignancy is actively investigated. We investigated the cytotoxicity of endocannabinoids and their hydrolysis inhibitors on the murine B16 melanoma cell line using a MTT test. Enzyme and receptor expression was measured by RT-PCR and enzymatic degradation of endocannabinoids using radiolabeled substrates. Cell death was assessed by Annexin-V/Propidium iodine staining. Tumors were induced in C57BL/6 mice by s.c. flank injection of B16 melanoma cells. Mice were injected i.p. for six days with vehicle or treatment, and tumor size was measured each day and weighted at the end of the treatment. Haematoxylin-Eosin staining and TUNEL assay were performed to quantify necrosis and apoptosis in the tumor and endocannabinoid levels were quantified by HPLC-MS. Tube formation assay and CD31 immunostaining were used to evaluate the antiangiogenic effects of the treatments. The N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide, AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol and N- palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) reduced viability of B16 cells. The association of PEA with the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597 considerably reduced cell viability consequently to an inhibition of PEA hydrolysis and an increase of PEA levels. The increase of cell death observed with this combination of molecules was confirmed in vivo where only co-treatment with both PEA and URB597 led to decreased melanoma progression. The antiproliferative action of the treatment was associated with an elevation of PEA levels and larger necrotic regions in the tumor.",Does the association of N-palmitoylethanolamine with the FAAH inhibitor URB597 impair melanoma growth through a supra-additive action?,This study suggests the interest of targeting the endocannabinoid system in the management of skin cancer and underlines the advantage of associating endocannabinoids with enzymatic hydrolysis inhibitors.

"It is much debated whether the metabolic syndrome contributes additional information over and above that provided by the individual components of the syndrome alone. Among HIV-infected individuals, we investigated whether any particular combinations of the components included in the definition of the metabolic syndrome are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We followed 33,347 HIV-infected individuals in a prospective observational study. The effect of combinations of components of the metabolic syndrome (low HDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, high BMI, hypertension, and diabetes) on the risk of CVD was assessed by Poisson regression incorporating interactions between each component pair and adjusting for age, sex, family history of CVD, smoking status, calendar year, and exposure to antiretroviral therapy. We reduced the risk of type 1 errors by randomly splitting the data set for training (70% of sample) and validation (remaining 30%). In the training data set, 671 patients experienced a CVD event over 110,652 person-years. Unadjusted, the presence of metabolic syndrome at study enrollment (>or=3 of the factors) was associated with a 2.89 higher risk of CVD (95% CI 2.34-3.59; P = 0.0001) compared with individuals without the metabolic syndrome. After adjustment for the individual components, the metabolic syndrome as an entity no longer predicted the risk of CVD (adjusted relative risk 0.85; 95% CI 0.61-1.17; P = 0.32).

"Inherited retinal dystrophies, including Retinitis Pigmentosa and Leber Congenital Amaurosis among others, are a group of genetically heterogeneous disorders that lead to variable degrees of visual deficits. They can be caused by mutations in over 100 genes and there is evidence for the presence of as yet unidentified genes in a significant proportion of patients. We aimed at identifying a novel gene for an autosomal recessive form of early onset severe retinal dystrophy in a patient carrying no previously described mutations in known genes. An integrated strategy including homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing was used to identify the responsible mutation. Functional tests were performed in the medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) model organism to gain further insight into the pathogenic role of the ADAMTS18 gene in eye and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. This study identified, in the analyzed patient, a homozygous missense mutation in the ADAMTS18 gene, which was recently linked to Knobloch syndrome, a rare developmental disorder that affects the eye and the occipital skull. In vivo gene knockdown performed in medaka fish confirmed both that the mutation has a pathogenic role and that the inactivation of this gene has a deleterious effect on photoreceptor cell function.",Is the ADAMTS18 gene responsible for autosomal recessive early onset severe retinal dystrophy?,This study reveals that mutations in the ADAMTS18 gene can cause a broad phenotypic spectrum of eye disorders and contribute to shed further light on the complexity of retinal diseases.,1,Is the ADAMTS18 gene linked to early onset autosomal recessive severe retinal degeneration?,19.0,1935.0,2086.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.3116669654846191,1.5425879955291748,3.926013946533203,"Yes, the ADAMTS18 gene is responsible for autosomal recessive early onset severe retinal dystrophy, as a homozygous missense mutation in this gene was identified in a patient with the condition.",0.7
"To test the hypothesis that radiotherapy (RT) improves the outcome of patients with unresected, nonmetastatic bronchoalveolar carcinoma (BAC) by performing a population-based analysis within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients diagnosed with BAC, Stage I-III, between 2001 and 2007. Exclusion criteria included unknown stage, unknown primary treatment modality, Stage IV disease, and those diagnosed at autopsy. Demographic data, treatment details, and overall survival were retrieved from the SEER database. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. A total of 6933 patients with Stage I-III BAC were included in the analysis. The median age at diagnosis was 70 years (range, 10-101 years). The majority of patients were diagnosed with Stage I (74.4%); 968 patients (14%) did not undergo surgical resection. Unresected patients were more likely to be older (p < 0.0001), male (p = 0.001), black (p < 0.0001), and Stage III (p < 0.0001). Within the cohort of unresected patients, 300 (31%) were treated with RT. The estimated 2-year overall survival for patients with unresected, nonmetastatic BAC was 58%, 44%, and 27% in Stage I, II, and III, respectively. Factors associated with improved survival included female sex, earlier stage at diagnosis, and use of RT. Median survival in those not receiving RT vs. receiving RT was as follows: Stage I, 28 months vs. 33 months (n = 364, p = 0.06); Stage II, 18 months vs. not reached (n = 31, nonsignificant); Stage III, 10 months vs. 17 months (n = 517, p < 0.003).",Does radiotherapy improve survival in unresected stage I-III bronchoalveolar carcinoma?,"The use of RT is associated with improved prognosis in unresected Stage I-III BAC.

"In cirrhotic patients with renal failure, renal blood flow autoregulation curve is shifted to the right, which is consequent upon sympathetic nervous system activation and endothelial dysfunction. Albumin infusion improves renal function in cirrhosis by mechanisms that are incompletely understood. We aimed to determine the effect of albumin infusion on systemic haemodynamics, renal blood flow, renal function and endothelial function in patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis and acute kidney injury. Twelve patients with refractory ascites and 10 patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis and acute kidney injury were studied. Both groups were treated with intravenous albumin infusion, 40-60 g/days over 3-4 days. Cardiac and renal haemodynamics were measured. Endothelial activation/dysfunction was assessed using von Willebrand factor and serum nitrite levels. F2α Isoprostanes, resting neutrophil burst and noradrenaline levels were quantified as markers of oxidative stress, endotoxemia and sympathetic activation respectively. Albumin infusion leads to a shift in the renal blood flow autoregulation curve towards normalization, which resulted in a significant increase in renal blood flow. Accordingly, improvement of renal function was observed. In parallel, a significant decrease in sympathetic activation, inflammation/oxidative stress and endothelial activation/dysfunction was documented. Improvement of renal blood flow correlated with improvement in endothelial activation (r = 0.741, P < 0.001).",Does albumin infusion improve renal blood flow autoregulation in patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis and acute kidney injury?,"The data suggest that albumin infusion improves renal function in acutely decompensated cirrhotic patients with acute kidney injury by impacting on renal blood flow autoregulation.

"To document the ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) during pregnancy compared to three months after delivery in singleton and twin pregnancies. Descriptive study with a follow-up design. University hospital in Eastern Finland. 43 childbearing women; 32 with singleton and 11 with twin pregnancies. Ambulatory blood pressure measurements were conducted using a digital ambulatory blood pressure system. AASI was calculated as 1 minus the regression slope of diastolic on systolic blood pressures obtained from 24-hour monitoring. Arterial stiffness measured by AASI. In normotensive pregnant women, the 95th percentiles of AASI were 0.40 in singleton and 0.46 in twin pregnancies, respectively, implying arterial normality and high elasticity. There were no differences in AASI values between singleton and twin pregnancies and no changes were observed postpartum. After delivery, but not during pregnancy, AASI correlated negatively with nocturnal systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction (dipping) (r=-0.536, p=0.001; r=-0.674, p<0.001) and with maternal HDL (r=-0.363, p=0.038) and positively with maternal age (r=0.440, p=0.009), whereas maternal BMI had a significant impact on AASI both during and after pregnancy (r=0.366, p=0.016; r=0.377, p=0.028).",Is ambulatory arterial stiffness index unchanged in uncomplicated third-trimester singleton and twin pregnancies?,"Normal singleton or twin pregnancies had no detectable effects on AASI.

"Prophylaxis against hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) includes lifelong hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and oral antiviral agent(s). In the presence of high-genetic-barrier nucleos(t)ide analogues, the need for lifelong HBIG is questioned. We evaluated the safety and cost-effectiveness of a limited HBIG course. OLT from 2006 to 2013 were reviewed. Patients with pre-OLT hepatitis B virus surface antigen who received HBV prophylaxis with 2 HBIG doses (anhepatic and first post-operative day; 10,000 units/dose) and potent nucleos(t)ide analogues were included. The primary end point was HBV recurrence (HBV-DNA detection). Thirteen patients (primary transplants) were included, median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was 18, and there was no fulminant failure; HBV-DNA was detected in 4 patients at OLT. After OLT, 10 patients received entecavir and/or tenofovir. Median follow-up was 23 months. One recurrence occurred (7.7%) at month 13 (HBV-DNA: 14 IU/mL); the graft maintained excellent function. This minimal viremic expression is related to hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence with neoplastic replication carrying integrated HBV-DNA; thus, there is no defined HBV viral recurrence.

"It has been suggested that atherosclerotic vascular disease is a chronic inflammatory process. The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of C-reactive protein (CRP) as a cardiovascular risk marker and predictor of death, as well as its relation to other factors of the metabolic syndrome in a cohort of type 2 diabetic patients at high risk of severe macrovascular complications. 592 patients, aged 55 to 74 years (311 men, 281 women), with signs and symptoms of circulation deficits were examined by duplex ultrasound for suspected cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial disease and followed over a period of 5 years. At baseline, 292 patients of the total group had type 2 diabetes (49.3%). Ischemic heart disease was present in 40.2%, internal carotid stenosis in 21.9% and peripheral arterial disease in 39.7% of the subjects. During the observation period, 104 patients had died, 72 (69.2%) due to cardiovascular causes. Non-fatal myocardial infarction occurred in 39 patients (7.4%), non-fatal stroke in 70 patients (13.3%) and amputations because of gangrene were unavoidable in 24 patients (4.6%). In Cox regression analysis, CRP was the strongest predictor of death and cardiovascular death in the total cohort (RR 3.7 [95% CI 1.86-7.50] and 5.4 [2.13-13.76]), as well as in the type 2 diabetic subgroup (RR 3.3 [1.27-8.70] and 5.4 [1.44-20.0]).

"The identification of industry, occupation, and associated injury costs for worker falls in Kentucky have not been fully examined. The purpose of this study was to determine the associations between industry and occupation and 1) hospitalization length of stay; 2) hospitalization charges; and 3) workers' claims costs in workers suffering falls, using linked inpatient hospitalization discharge and workers' claims data sets. Hospitalization cases were selected with ICD-9-CM external cause of injury codes for falls and payer code of workers' claims for years 2000-2004. Selection criteria for workers'claims cases were International Association of Industrial Accident Boards and Commissions Electronic Data Interchange Nature (IAIABCEDIN) injuries coded as falls and/or slips.

"Capillary blood glucose measurements are regularly used for nursing home residents with diabetes. The usefulness of these measurements relies on clear indications for use, correct measurement techniques, proper documentation and clinical use of the resulting blood glucose values. The use of a regular, invasive procedure may also entail additional challenges in a population of older, multimorbid patients who often suffer from cognitive impairment or dementia. The aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of physicians, registered nurses and auxiliary nurses on the use, usefulness and potential challenges of using capillary blood glucose measurements in nursing homes, and the procedures for doing so. This was a qualitative study that used three profession-specific focus group interviews. Interviews were transcribed in modified verbatim form and analysed in accordance with Malterud's principles of systematic text condensation. Five physicians, four registered nurses and three auxiliary nurses participated in the focus groups. All professional groups regarded capillary blood glucose measurements as a necessity in the management of diabetes, the physicians to ensure that the treatment is appropriate, and the nurses to be certain and assured about their caring decisions. Strict glycaemic control and excessive measurements were avoided in order to promote the well-being and safety of the residents.

"To investigate the potential regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and to identify individual MMPs essential for migration of human corneal epithelial cells. Migration of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) was measured with a colony dispersion assay in response to concentrations of HGF (0-50 ng/mL). MMP activity in the conditioned media collected from the dispersion assay was assessed by zymography. The broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor ilomastat (1-100 microM) or an MMP-9-neutralizing antibody (1-10 microg/mL) were included in the dispersion assay to determine their effects on HCEC migration. Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization were used to localize MMP-1 in HCECs in the colony dispersion assay and in a human ex vivo corneal wound-healing model, respectively. ELISA for MMP-1 was performed on conditioned medium from migrating HCECs. Neutralizing antibodies to MMP-1 and -9 were added to an in vitro scratch-wound model to assess the effect on HCEC healing. HCEC migration (P < 0.05) and MMP-2 and -9 released into the medium increased in response to HGF in a dose-dependent manner up to 20 ng/mL. Broad-spectrum MMP inhibition significantly reduced HCEC migration (P < 0.05). In contrast, neutralization of MMP-9 increased migration (P < 0.05). MMP-1 was found in association with HCECs at the migratory leading edge in both the dispersion and the ex vivo wound-healing experiments, and was found to be stimulated above basal levels by HGF.

"Although metabolic reduction in the primary visual cortex on [(18) F]-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomographic (PET) scans is the hallmark of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) for differential diagnosis from Alzheimer's disease, the clinical significance of the metabolic pattern in patients without dementia remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical profiles of patients without dementia with the metabolic pattern and its relevance to DLB. Of 145 individuals who underwent (18) F-FDG PET, 25 patients with glucose hypometabolism in the primary visual cortex were identified based on three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection images through comparison with a normative database.

"Bone metastases often occur in the majority of patients with advanced cancer, such as prostate cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer. Serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP 5b), a novel bone resorption marker, has been used gradually in the clinics as a specific and sensitive marker of bone resorption for the early diagnosis of cancer patients with bone metastasis. Here, we reported that high concentrations of uric acid (UA) lead to decrease of TRACP 5b levels and determined whether TRACP 5b level was associated with UA in interference experiment. A total of 77 patients with high concentrations of UA and 77 healthy subjects were tested to evaluate the differences in their TRACP 5b levels. Serial dilutions of UA were respectively spiked with a known concentration of TRACP 5b standard sample, then Serum TRACP 5b was detected by using bone TRAP® Assay. A correction equation was set to eliminate UA-derived TRACP 5b false-decrease. The effect of this correction was evaluated in high-UA individuals. The average TRACP level of the high-UA individuals (1.47 ± 0.62 U/L) was significantly lower than that of the healthy subjects (2.62 ± 0.63 U/L) (t-test, p < 0.0001).

"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether acetylcholine may be a useful tool for detection of early angiographically undetectable coronary atherosclerosis in heart transplant recipients. Coronary artery disease is the main determinant of long-term prognosis in transplant recipients. Acetylcholine-induced constriction of angiographically normal coronary arteries in heart transplant recipients could be due to early atherosclerosis, and acetylcholine has been proposed for early detection of coronary artery disease. The responses of large coronary arteries to stepwise intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine (10(-8) to 10(-5) mol/liter) were compared in five control subjects and in four groups of transplant recipients 1, 6, 12 and > 24 months postoperatively (group 1, n = 6; group 2, n = 7; group 3, n = 6; group 4, n = 6, respectively). All patients had normal coronary arteriographic findings. Vessel dimensions were measured in four segments in each patient. In control subjects, acetylcholine increased diameters significantly at 10(-8), 10(-7) and 10(-6) mol/liter (all p < 0.001 vs. basal value). No significant variation was observed at 10(-5) mol/liter. Intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate increased diameters of all segments (p < 0.001). In transplant recipients, vessel diameters did not vary significantly from baseline at 10(-8) and 10(-7) mol/liter concentrations in groups 1 and 3 and at 10(-8) mol/liter in group 4. Vessels constricted significantly in all the other cases.

"It is well known that among hypertensive patients, an increased left ventricular mass (LVM) is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, the mechanisms underlying LVM in hypertension are not completely understood, as the absolute value of blood pressure and other risk factors associated do not predict alone a definite LVM progression. Recently, the 9p21 chromosomal region has been consistently associated with coronary heart disease. We examined the association of 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the short arm of chromosome 9 with LVM in 821 hypertensive individuals from northern Italy. We identified a SNP (rs894379) in the intronic region of the centlein, centrosomal protein (CNTLN) gene on chromosome 9p22, whose minor allele G is associated with an increased LVM. We performed a follow-up validation analysis for the top SNP in 1038 hypertensive individuals from southern Italy.

"This study sought to determine the effects of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling in postinfarction heart failure. Long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors is beneficial in experimental animals and patients with heart failure. Because this treatment typically produces only small improvements in LV systolic function, we hypothesized that improvements in LV diastolic filling might contribute to the overall beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors after myocardial infarction (MI). We performed transthoracic echocardiographic-Doppler examinations in rats 1 and 6 weeks after transmural MI or sham operation. Rats with MI were randomized to no treatment (n = 10) or captopril (2 g/liter in drinking water, n = 8) after the baseline echocardiogram. Six weeks after MI, untreated rats had significant LV dilation compared with sham-operated rats (LV diastolic dimension [mean+/-SEM] 10.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 8.5 +/- 0.3 mm, p < 0.05). Rats with untreated MI also had impaired fractional shortening (9 +/- 1% vs. 34 +/- 2%, p < 0.05) and depressed systolic thickening of the noninfarcted posterior wall (3% +/- 3% vs, 65 +/- 9%, p < 0.05). Rats with MI showed progressively restricted LV diastolic filling as assessed by transmitral Doppler recordings. At 6 weeks, peak early filling velocity (E) was increased (97 +/- 3 vs. 77 +/- 2 cm/s, p < 0.05), E wave deceleration was more rapid (23 +/- 3 vs. 12 +/- 1 m/s2, p < 0.05), isovolumetric relaxation time was decreased (18 +/- 1 vs. 24 +/- 1 ms, p < 0.05), and late filling velocity was lower (26 +/- 7 vs. 34 +/- 1 cm/s, p < 0.05) in rats with MI versus sham-operated rats. Compared with rats with untreated MI, rats receiving captopril had similar LV diastolic dimensions (10.5 +/- 0.35 vs. 10.7 +/- 0.35 mm), slightly higher fractional shortening (16 +/- 2% vs. 9 +/- 1%, p < 0.05 [captopril MI vs. untreated MI]) and unchanged posterior wall thickening (49 +/- 12% vs. 37 +/- 3%, p = 0.3).

"The latent HIV-1 reservoir represents the primary barrier to the eradication of HIV-1 infection. The design of novel reservoir-clearance strategies, however, is impeded in part by the inability to distinguish latently HIV-infected cells from uninfected cells. Significant impairment of the type I interferon (IFN-I) response is observed during productive HIV-1 infection.

"Atherosclerosis is a chronic autoimmune-like disease in which lipids and fibrous elements accumulate in the arterial blood vessels. T cells are present within atherosclerotic plaques, and their activation is partially dependent on costimulatory signals, which can either provide positive or negative signals that promote T-cell activation or limit T-cell responses, respectively. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) is a coinhibitory type 1 transmembrane protein that affects the function of several immune cells involved in atherosclerosis, such as monocytes, macrophages, effector T cells, and regulatory T cells.

To preserve photoreceptor cell structure and function in a rodent model of retinitis pigmentosa with P23H rhodopsin by selective inhibition of the mutant rhodopsin allele using a second generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). Wild-type mice and rats were treated with ASO by intravitreal (IVT) injection and rhodopsin mRNA and protein expression were measured. Transgenic rats expressing the murine P23H rhodopsin gene (P23H transgenic rat Line 1) were administered either a mouse-specific P23H ASO or a control ASO. The contralateral eye was injected with PBS and used as a comparator control. Electroretinography (ERG) measurements and analyses of the retinal outer nuclear layer were conducted and correlated with rhodopsin mRNA levels. Rhodopsin mRNA and protein expression was reduced after a single ASO injection in wild-type mice with a rhodopsin-specific ASO. Transgenic rat eyes that express a murine P23H rhodopsin gene injected with a murine P23H ASO had a 181 ± 39% better maximum amplitude response (scotopic a-wave) as compared with contralateral PBS-injected eyes; the response in control ASO eyes was not significantly different from comparator contralateral eyes.

"Visceral pain is an important and prevalent clinical condition whose treatment is challenging. Sigma-1 (σ1) receptors modulate somatic pain, but their involvement in pure visceral pain is unexplored. The authors evaluated the role of σ1 receptors in intracolonic capsaicin-induced visceral pain (pain-related behaviors and referred mechanical hyperalgesia to the abdominal wall) using wild-type (WT) (n = 12 per group) and σ1 receptor knockout (σ1-KO) (n = 10 per group) mice, selective σ1 receptor antagonists (BD-1063, S1RA, and NE-100), and control drugs (morphine and ketoprofen). The intracolonic administration of capsaicin (0.01-1%) induced concentration-dependent visceral pain-related behaviors and referred hyperalgesia in both WT and σ1-KO mice. However, the maximum number of pain-related behaviors induced by 1% capsaicin in σ1-KO mice (mean ± SEM, 22 ± 2.9) was 48% of that observed in WT animals (46 ± 4.2). Subcutaneous administration of the σ1 receptor antagonists BD-1063 (16-64 mg/kg), S1RA (32-128 mg/kg), and NE-100 (8-64 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced the number of behavioral responses (by 53, 62, and 58%, respectively) and reversed the referred hyperalgesia to mechanical control threshold (0.53 ± 0.05 g) in WT mice. In contrast, these drugs produced no change in σ1-KO mice. Thus, the effects of these drugs are specifically mediated by σ1 receptors. Morphine produced an inhibition of capsaicin-induced visceral pain in WT and σ1-KO mice, whereas ketoprofen had no effect in either mouse type.",Are σ1 receptors involved in the visceral pain induced by intracolonic administration of capsaicin in mice?,These results suggest that σ1 receptors play a role in the mechanisms underlying capsaicin-induced visceral pain and raise novel perspectives for their potential therapeutic value.,1,Are sigma-1 receptors implicated in the visceral discomfort triggered by intracolonic administration of capsaicin in murine models?,25.0,2591.0,2778.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.501217603683472,1.9876351356506348,5.677675485610962,"Yes, σ1 receptors are involved in the visceral pain induced by intracolonic administration of capsaicin in mice, as evidenced by the reduced pain-related behaviors in σ1 receptor knockout (σ1-KO) mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice and the effectiveness of σ1 receptor antagonists in reducing pain responses in WT mice.",1.0
"The most common genetic variant of luteinizing hormone (LH), variant-betaLH, has a different bioactivity than the wildtype.

"Despite the growing clinical use of brain tissue oxygen monitoring, the specific determinants of low brain tissue oxygen tension (P(bt)O2) following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) remain poorly defined. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether P(bt)O2 more closely reflects variables related to cerebral oxygen diffusion or reflects cerebral oxygen delivery and metabolism. Prospective observational study. Level I trauma center. Fourteen TBI patients with advanced neuromonitoring underwent an oxygen challenge (increase in FiO2 to 1.0) to assess tissue oxygen reactivity, pressure challenge (increase in mean arterial pressure) to assess autoregulation, and CO2 challenge (hyperventilation) to assess cerebral vasoreactivity. None. P(bt)O2 was measured directly with a parenchymal probe in the least-injured hemisphere. Local cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with a parenchymal thermal diffusion probe.

"Reflux grade is the factor most commonly used to predict spontaneous reflux resolution. We evaluated other potential predictive factors aside from reflux grade relative to spontaneous resolution. We reviewed the records of 20 males and 98 females who were diagnosed with primary vesicoureteral reflux between ages 0 and 7 years between 1990 and 2000. Age, sex, height, weight, reflux grade, bladder volume at onset of reflux and laterality were recorded for the first, second and most recent voiding cystourethrogram or nuclear cystogram before spontaneous resolution or operative intervention. Of 118 patients 75 (64%) had spontaneous resolution, 27 (23%) underwent corrective surgery and 16 (13%) are still being followed. Average age at diagnosis was 2.3 years (range 1 day to 7.7 years) and average followup was 4.3 years (range 0.2 to 14). Average time to spontaneous resolution was 2.2 years (range 0.5 to 10.3) vs a time to operative treatment of 3.6 years (range 0.2 to 11.2). There was a significantly higher spontaneous resolution rate for lower reflux grades (p = 0.0004). Reflux occurring at greater than 75% of predicted bladder capacity had a significantly higher resolution rate (p = 0.0005).

"The NIH consensus conference in 1994 recommended that all patients with peptic ulcers should be tested and treated for Helicobacter pylori. Recent studies have shown that the eradication of H. pylori is associated with a significant reduction in the relapse rate of peptic ulcers, but there are few reports about long-term outcome. To evaluate the relapse rate of peptic ulcer in the long-term follow-up of patients after H. pylori eradication therapy. Patients infected with H. pylori (445; 88 duodenal ulcer, 357 gastric ulcer) were randomly divided into three groups. In group A, patients received 'conventional treatment' including acid decreasing therapy with a histamine H2-receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In group B, patients received 'dual therapy' including one antibiotic plus acid-decreasing therapy. In group C, patients received 'triple therapy' with PPI plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin. Eradication of H. pylori infection was assessed by histology of biopsy specimens from both the antrum and body corpus at 4 weeks, and 6 and 12 months after stopping therapy. Endoscopy was performed at intervals of 6 months for 5 years. Intention-to-treat eradication rates for the duodenal ulcer patients were 0% for group A, 46% for group B and 80% for group C; eradication rates for the gastric ulcer patients were 0%, 33% and 83% respectively.

"General control non-depressible 5 (GCN5) is a crucial catalytic component of a transcriptional regulatory complex that plays important roles in cellular functions from cell cycle regulation to DNA damage repair. Although GCN5 has recently been implicated in certain oncogenic roles, its role in liver cancer progression remains vague. In this study, we report that GCN5 was overexpressed in 17 (54.8 %) of 31 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens. Down-regulation of GCN5 inhibited HCC cell proliferation and xenograft tumor formation. GCN5 knockdown decreased the protein levels of the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1), but increased the protein levels of cell cycle inhibitor p21(Cip1/Waf1) in HepG2 cells.

"The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of 2-(fluorine-18)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT in comparison with MRI for the detection of recurrent ovarian cancer. Forty-seven patients with suspected ovarian cancer recurrence after total ablative or cytoreductive surgery, as well as neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, who had undergone (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging were recruited for the present study. All patients also underwent MRI within a month of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for the same purpose. Recurrent cancer in the abdomen and pelvis was evaluated in each of the 47 patients and classified as either distant metastasis or local pelvic recurrence involving the vaginal stump, peritoneal implants, supradiaphragmatic region, and/or abdominal and pelvic lymph nodes. Special attention was paid to peritoneal implants. These were divided into five groups according to size of the implants: less than 0.5 cm (group 1), 0.5-1 cm (group 2), 1-2 cm (group 3), 2-3 cm (group 4), and larger than 3 cm (group 5). PET/CT findings were compared with abdominopelvic MR findings. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Thirty-nine of 47 patients were found to have recurrent ovarian cancer. Both PET/CT and MRI were negative for recurrence in six patients. Overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT were 97.5, 100, 100, 87.5, and 97.8%, respectively, whereas those of MRI were 95, 85.7, 97.4, 75, and 93.6%, respectively.

"Interactions between calcium and vitamin D may have implications for the regulation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and its catabolism and, consequently, the vitamin D dietary requirement. We investigated whether different calcium intakes influenced serum 25(OH)D and indexes of vitamin D activation and catabolism during winter and in the context of both adequate and inadequate vitamin D intakes. A 15-wk winter-based, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind vitamin D₃ intervention (20 μg/d) study was carried out in free-living men and women aged ≥50 y (n = 125) who were stratified according to calcium intakes [moderate-low (<700 mg/d) or high (>1000 mg/d) intake].

"Division by total body weight is the usual way to standardise peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) for body size. However, this method systematically underestimates cardiopulmonary fitness in obese individuals. Our aim was to analyse whether lean-mass is a better base for a body mass-independent standard of cardiopulmonary fitness. A population based sample of 578 men (body mass index (BMI) 19-47 kg/m(2)) and 592 women (BMI 16-49 kg/m(2)) 57-78 years of age. Peak VO2 was assessed by respiratory gas analysis during a maximal exercise test on a cycle ergometer. We studied the validity of the weight-ratio and the lean mass-ratio standards in a linear regression model. The weight-ratio standard implies an increase of peak VO2 per additional kg body weight with 20.7 ml/min (95% confidence interval (CI): 20.3-21.1) in women and 26.9 ml/min (95% CI: 26.4-27.5) in men.

The ICCs generated pacemaker potentials in the mouse small intestine. SMS produced membrane depolarization with concentration-dependent manners in the current clamp mode. Pretreatment with a Ca(2+) free solution and thapsigargin, a Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor in the endoplasmic reticulum, stopped the generation of the pacemaker potentials. In the case of Ca(2+)-free solutions, SMS induced membrane depolarizations. However, when thapsigargin in a bath solution was applied, the membrane depolarization was not produced by SMS. The membrane depolarizations produced by SMS were inhibited by U-73122, an active phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitors. Furthermore, chelerythrine and calphostin C, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors had no effects on SMS-induced membrane depolarizations.",Does shengmaisan regulate pacemaker potentials in interstitial cells of cajal in mice?,These results suggest that SMS might affect GI motility by modulating the pacemaker activity through an internal Ca(2+)- and PLC-dependent and PKC-independent pathway in the ICCs.,1,Does shengmaisan influence pacemaker activity in interstitial cells of Cajal in mice?,19.0,2064.0,2206.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.743494987487793,1.3804142475128174,4.1113481521606445,"Yes, shengmaisan (SMS) regulates pacemaker potentials in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) in mice by producing membrane depolarization in a concentration-dependent manner.",0.8
"To investigate the protein expressions of breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and 2 (BRCA2) in prostatectomy specimens of localized prostate cancer (PC) patients, along with their associations with cancer characteristics and prognosis. Immunohistochemistry for BRCA1 and BRCA2 was performed on tissue microarrays of 510 PC cases treated from 2002 to 2012. The cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was scored for intensity, and clinicopathological parameters, including biochemical recurrence (BCR), were evaluated. During a median follow-up of 44 months, 128 patients developed BCR, with positive staining rates of 93.3% (n = 476) and 41.6% (n = 212) for BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively, in the malignant tissues. The BRCA2 expression differed significantly between BCR-positive and BCR-free cases [hazard ratio (HR): 1.75, P = 0.002]. BRCA1 and BRCA2 correlated significantly with age [odds ratio (OR): 0.131] and pN stage (OR: 6.00), pN stage (OR: 1.717) and BCR (OR: 1.972), respectively (P < 0.05).

"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is activated and the expression of BMP receptors (BMPRs) is induced around the fracture site during the early phase of fracture repair. HGF facilitates the expression of BMPRs in mesenchymal cells. This study suggests that HGF contributes to fracture repair by inducing the expression of BMPRs. The precise mechanisms that control the upregulation of BMP, BMPRs, and other molecules involved in bone repair are not completely understood. In this study, we hypothesized that HGF, activated through the action of thrombin on the HGF activator, may enhance BMP action through the local induction of BMP or BMPRs. Callus samples from tibial fractures in mice were harvested for immunohistochemical analysis of HGF and phosphorylated c-Met, for in situ hybridization of BMPRs, and for real-time RT-PCR analysis for the expression of HGF, c-Met, and BMPRs. To study the changes in gene expression of BMPRs in response to HGF, C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured with or without HGF and harvested for real-time RT-PCR and for Western blot analysis. To evaluate the contribution of HGF to the biological action of BMP2, C3H10T1/2 cells and primary muscle-derived mesenchymal cells were precultured with HGF and cultured with BMP2. In addition, the expression of the luciferase gene linked to the Id1 promoter containing the BMP responsive element and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were assayed. Positive immunostaining of HGF and phosphorylated c-Met was detected around the fracture site at 1 day after the fracture was made. mRNA expression of BMPRs was increased 1 day after fracture and localized in mesenchymal cells at the fracture site. From an in vitro study, the expression of mRNA for BMPRs was elevated by treatment with HGF, but the expression of BMP4 did not change. Western blot analysis also showed the upregulation of BMPR2 by HGF treatment. The results from the luciferase and ALP assays indicated increased responsiveness to BMPs by treating with HGF.",Does hepatocyte growth factor contribute to fracture repair by upregulating the expression of BMP receptors?,"This study indicates that HGF is activated and expressed at the fracture site and that HGF induces the upregulation of BMPRs in mesenchymal cells.

"An imbalance between zinc and copper metabolism has been reported to predispose to coronary artery disease (CAD) in Western populations, but there are little data for other racial groups. We have therefore investigated the association between serum copper and zinc, and CAD in Iranian subjects undergoing coronary angiography. Serum copper, zinc, fasting lipid profile, and blood glucose levels were measured in 114 patients (67 male and 47 female) undergoing routine coronary angiogram. Anthropometric features including blood pressure were determined using standard procedures. Demographic characteristics, including menopausal status and smoking habit, were assessed by questionnaire. Male patients had lower serum copper (p<0.05), lower serum zinc (p<0.05), and higher serum zinc/copper ratio (p<0.05) than females. Serum copper and zinc concentrations were significantly lower in the subjects with angiographically defined CAD than those patients with a normal angiogram, although the zinc/copper ratio was higher in these patients (p<0.001). Serum copper (r=-0.303, p<0.001) and zinc (r=-0.250, p<0.01) concentrations were both inversely related to age, and copper was positively associated with fasting serum triglycerides (r=0.188, p<0.05).",Are serum copper and zinc concentrations lower in Iranian patients with angiographically defined coronary artery disease than in subjects with a normal angiogram?,"Serum copper and zinc concentrations were significantly lower in Iranian patients with abnormal versus those with a normal angiogram.

"Leaves of Jacaranda decurrens are used in traditional Brazilian medicine to treat metabolic diseases related to increased reactive oxygen species. The present study evaluated the antioxidant and cytotoxic potential of hydroethanolic extract from the leaves of Jacaranda decurrens subsp. symmetrifoliolata. Phenolic compounds, flavonoids and saponins were evaluated in an ethanol:water (80:20, v/v) extract from the leaves of Jacaranda decurrens subsp. symmetrifoliolata (E-Jds). The antioxidant activity of E-Jds was investigated by assessing the following: 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity; protection against 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced hemolysis of erythrocytes; in vitro and in vivo malondialdehyde dosage; and the ability to activate antioxidant enzymes. K562 leukemia cells were used for the cytotoxic evaluation of E-Jds and for the assessment of the cell death profile through flow cytometry. Phenolic and flavonoid compounds were quantified as 14.38% and 2.15%, respectively, of E-Jds. These phenolic and flavonoid compounds proved to be able to scavenge DPPH free radicals with an IC50 of 9.3 ± 3.3 µg/mL, to protect up to 50% of erythrocytes against AAPH-induced hemolysis and to reduce in vitro and in vivo malondialdehyde levels up to 84% and 22%, respectively.

"We aimed to clarify the incidence and the clinicopathological value of non-muscle myoglobin (Mb) in a large cohort of non-invasive and invasive breast cancer cases. Matched pairs of breast tissues from 10 patients plus 17 breast cell lines were screened by quantitative PCR for Mb mRNA. In addition, 917 invasive and 155 non-invasive breast cancer cases were analysed by immunohistochemistry for Mb expression and correlated to clinicopathological parameters and basal molecular characteristics including oestrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha)/progesteron receptor (PR)/HER2, fatty acid synthase (FASN), hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), HIF-2alpha, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). The spatial relationship of Mb and ERalpha or FASN was followed up by double immunofluorescence. Finally, the effects of estradiol treatment and FASN inhibition on Mb expression in breast cancer cells were analysed. Myoglobin mRNA was found in a subset of breast cancer cell lines; in microdissected tumours Mb transcript was markedly upregulated. In all, 71% of tumours displayed Mb protein expression in significant correlation with a positive hormone receptor status and better prognosis. In silico data mining confirmed higher Mb levels in luminal-type breast cancer. Myoglobin was also correlated to FASN, HIF-2alpha and CAIX, but not to HIF-1alpha or GLUT1, suggesting hypoxia to participate in its regulation. Double immunofluorescence showed a cellular co-expression of ERalpha or FASN and Mb.

"Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (ESBLEC) is an increasingly significant cause of community-acquired infection worldwide. The epidemiological features of CTX-M- and SHV-producing ESBLEC causing community-acquired infections are compared. A multicentre cohort study including all community-acquired infections caused by ESBLEC in four geographical areas of Spain was carried out. ESBL characterization was by isoelectric focusing, PCR and sequencing. Demographics, previous healthcare contact, co-morbidity, use of antimicrobials, invasive procedures and type of infection were collected for all patients. Patients with CTX-M- and SHV-producing isolates were compared using logistic regression. One hundred and twenty-two cases (95% urinary tract infections) were included. ESBLs were characterized in 112 isolates; 77 isolates (69%) produced CTX-M, 36 (32%) produced SHV and 7 (6%) produced TEM enzymes (8 produced >1 ESBL). Patients with isolates producing CTX-M enzymes only (CTX-M group, n = 70) and SHV enzymes only (SHV group, n = 31) were compared. There were no differences in terms of underlying disease, previous healthcare contact, invasive procedures, antibiotic use or type of infection. Multivariate analysis including geographical area showed that a Charlson Index score of >2 (OR = 4.0; 95% CI = 1.2-12.6) was associated with SHV isolates, while age >60 (4.7; 1.7-12.5) was associated with CTX-M isolates.",Is escherichia coli producing SHV-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase a significant cause of community-acquired infection?,SHV-producing ESBLEC is a significant cause of community-acquired infection in Spain; the clinical epidemiology of such isolates seems very similar to that of CTX-M-producing E. coli.,1,Is Escherichia coli that produces SHV-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase a major contributor to infections acquired in the community?,28.0,2417.0,2577.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.9797780513763428,1.460928440093994,4.476908683776856,"Yes, Escherichia coli producing SHV-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase is a significant cause of community-acquired infection, although CTX-M-producing strains are more prevalent.",0.8

In the present analysis we sought to identify associations between regional GM volume--as measured by voxel-based morphometry (VBM)--and a smoking cessation treatment outcome (point prevalence abstinence at 4 weeks). Adult smokers underwent high-resolution anatomical MRI scanning prior to an open label smoking cessation treatment trial. VBM was conducted in SPM5 using the DARTEL algorithm and relapser vs. quitter groups were compared using independent sample t tests (p < 0.001, uncorrected).

"Previous studies demonstrated that toll-like receptors 4 and 2 (TLR-4 and TLR-2), which are expressed on liver-resident Kupffer, hepatic stellate cells, and circulating monocytes, play a role in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Lecinoxoids are oxidized phospholipids that antagonize TLR-2- and TLR-4-mediated activation of innate immune cells and inhibit monocyte migration. In this study, we tested the effect of two functionally different lecinoxoids on the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis in a mouse model. Two-day-old C57BL/6 mice were injected with streptozotocin and fed a high-fat diet from Week 4 after birth. At Week 6 post-birth, lecinoxoids VB-201 or VB-703 were given orally, once daily, for 3 weeks. Telmisartan was administered orally, once daily, for 3 weeks, as positive control. At experiment conclusion, biochemical indices were evaluated. HE stain and quantitative PCR were used to determine the extent of steatosis and steatohepatitis, and Sirius red stain was used to assess liver fibrosis. Treatment with lecinoxoids did not alter the concentration of blood glucose, liver triglycerides, or steatosis compared with solvent-treated mice.

The IT consisted of assertive community treatment, multifamily groups, psycho-education and social skills training, and the caseload was 1:10 compared with 1:25 in ST. Since attrition was considerable, a mixed model analysis with repeated measurements was used to examine the possible effects of IT statistically.

"To assess physician-patient communication about headache-related disability and to evaluate the influence of information about disability on physicians' perceptions of illness severity and the treatment needs of migraineurs. Evidence suggests that migraine is suboptimally treated in clinical practice, partly due to poor communication between physicians and their patients. One hundred five neurologists and primary care physicians with an interest in headache participated in two interactive surveys, one in North America (n=42) and one in Europe (n=63). Each survey focused on the evaluation of four videotaped migraine cases. The first case was evaluated twice, initially after a typical symptom history that centered on diagnosis and then following a fuller history of migraine disability. Additional questions assessed the extent of the collection of migraine disability information in clinical practice. Physicians reported that they recorded symptoms relating to diagnosis (eg, pain location/intensity, associated symptoms) rather than information on headache-related disability. Only about one third of patients volunteered disability information. When made available to them, physicians rated information on disability as one of the most important factors in assessing treatment needs. In particular, when physicians knew the patient's disability history: (1) the proportion of physicians who rated the patient's illness as ""severe"" increased by 128% in North America, 27% in Europe; (2) the proportion of physicians who recommended immediate treatment increased by 63% in North America, 37% in Europe; and (3) the proportion of patients recommended for a follow-up visit increased by 15% in North America, 18% in Europe.",Does information about migraine disability influence physicians ' perceptions of illness severity and treatment needs?,"Physicians and patients often fail to discuss headache-related disability during consultation.

"We determine whether clinical characteristics and physician assessment are useful in the exclusion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in emergency department (ED) patients with ascites requiring paracentesis. We conducted a prospective, observational study of ED patients with ascites undergoing paracentesis. Predefined clinical characteristics including historical features and ED vital signs were recorded. Each patient was assessed by 2 separate, blinded physicians for severity of abdominal tenderness and overall clinical suspicion for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The primary outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LR) of the individual clinical characteristics and the physician assessments. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was defined by absolute neutrophil count greater than 250 cells/mm(3) or positive fluid culture result. There were 285 separate physician assessments in 144 patients enrolled with complete data. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was diagnosed in 17 (11.8%) patients. Physician clinical impression had a sensitivity of 76% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62% to 91%) and specificity of 34% (95% CI 28% to 40%) for the detection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The lowest negative LR was associated with the presence of any abdominal pain or tenderness (negative LR=0.4); however, the presence of pain/tenderness was also observed in 85% of patients without spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

"Recently, we reported that liver Label Retaining Cancer Cells (LRCC) can initiate tumors with only 10 cells and are relatively resistant to the targeted drug Sorafenib, a standard of practice in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LRCC are the only cancer stem cells (CSC) isolated alive according to a stem cell fundamental function, asymmetric cell division. Metformin has been reported to preferentially target many other types of CSC of different organs, including liver. It's important to know if LRCC, a novel class of CSC, are relatively resistant to metformin, unlike other types of CSC. As metformin inhibits the Sorafenib-Target-Protein (STP) PI3K, and LRCC are newly described CSC, we undertook this study to test the effects of Metformin on Sorafenib-treated HCC and HCC-derived-LRCC. We tested various STP levels and phosphorylation status, associated genes' expression, proliferation, viability, toxicity, and apoptosis profiles, before and after treatment with Sorafenib with/without Metformin. Metformin enhances the effects of Sorafenib on HCC, and significantly decreased viability/proliferation of HCC cells. This insulin-independent effect was associated with inhibition of multiple STPs (PKC, ERK, JNK and AKT). However, Metformin increased the relative proportion of LRCCs. Comparing LRCC vs. non-LRCC, this effect was associated with improved toxicity and apoptosis profiles, down-regulation of cell death genes and up-regulation of cell proliferation and survival genes in LRCC. Concomitantly, Metformin up-regulated pluripotency, Wnt, Notch and SHH pathways genes in LRCC vs. non-LRCC.",Do liver Label Retaining Cancer Cells Are Relatively Resistant to the Reported Anti-Cancer Stem Cell Drug Metformin?,"Metformin and Sorafenib have enhanced anti-cancer effects. However, in contradistinction to reports on other types of CSC, Metformin is less effective against HCC-derived-CSC LRCC. Our results suggest that combining Metformin with Sorafenib may be able to repress the bulk of tumor cells, but as with other anti-cancer drugs, may leave LRCC behind leading to cancer recurrence. Therefore, liver LRCC, unlike other types of CSC, are relatively resistant to the reported anti-cancer stem cell drug metformin. This is the first report that there is a type of CSC that is not relatively resistant to the CSC-targeting drug.

"Regulatory T cells (Treg) are present in atherosclerotic lesions and can modulate disease. In this study we characterized changes in Treg responses associated with prolonged hypercholesterolemia and lesion progression. Low-density lipoprotein receptor null mice in which Treg express green fluorescent protein were fed a control or cholesterol-rich diet, and green fluorescent protein-positive cells were enumerated in lymphoid tissues and in aorta. Splenic Treg numbers increased after 4, 8, and 20 weeks in cholesterol-diet-fed mice. However, the number of circulating and lesional Treg peaked at 4 weeks and decreased significantly at 8 and 20 weeks, concomitant with increased numbers of CD4(+) effector T cells and increased lesion size over this period. Treg expression of selectin ligands and their ability to bind to aortic endothelium decreased after prolonged hypercholesterolemia, and apoptosis of lesional Treg increased.

"To evaluate the association patterns and quantify the effects of lifestyle on time to pregnancy (TTP). Observational study. Teaching hospitals in Hull, United Kingdom. Two thousand and one hundred twelve consecutive pregnant women. A questionnaire inquiring about TTP, contraceptive use, pregnancy planning, previous subfertility/pregnancies, age, and lifestyle characteristics of either partner. We compared TTP, conception rates, and relative risk of subfecundity between subgroups with different lifestyle characteristics. We found that TTP was significantly longer if the woman or partner smoked >15 cigarettes/day (P<.001 and.04, respectively), the partner consumed >20 alcohol units/week (P<.001), the woman's body mass index was >25 kg/m(2) (P<.001), their coffee and/or tea intake was >6 cups/day (P=.04), or if they were socially deprived (P<.001). Each of these effects remained unchanged after adjusting for the potential confounders. The relative-risks of subfecundity with each of these variables ranged between 1.4 to 1.9 (1.4 to 3.6 after adjustment). The effects of coital frequency and recreational drug use were insignificant.

"To evaluate multiparametric-MRI (mpMRI) derived histogram textural-analysis parameters for detection of transition zone (TZ) prostatic tumour. Sixty-seven consecutive men with suspected prostate cancer underwent 1.5T mpMRI prior to template-mapping-biopsy (TPM). Twenty-six men had 'significant' TZ tumour. Two radiologists in consensus matched TPM to the single axial slice best depicting tumour, or largest TZ diameter for those with benign histology, to define single-slice whole TZ-regions-of-interest (ROIs). Textural-parameter differences between single-slice whole TZ-ROI containing significant tumour versus benign/insignificant tumour were analysed using Mann Whitney U test. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by receiver operating characteristic area under curve (ROC-AUC) analysis cross-validated with leave-one-out (LOO) analysis. ADC kurtosis was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in TZ containing significant tumour with ROC-AUC 0.80 (LOO-AUC 0.78); the difference became non-significant following exclusion of significant tumour from single-slice whole TZ-ROI (p = 0.23).

"ABCC6 plays a crucial role in ectopic calcification; mutations of the gene cause pseudoxanthoma elasticum and general arterial calcification of infancy. To elucidate the role of ABCC6 in cellular physiology and disease, it is crucial to establish the exact subcellular localization of the native ABCC6 protein. In a recent article in Circulation Research, ABCC6 was reported to localize to the mitochondria-associated membrane and not the plasma membrane. As the suggested mitochondrial localization is inconsistent with published data and the presumed role of ABCC6, we performed experiments to determine the cellular localization of ABCC6 in its physiological environment. We performed immunofluorescent labeling of frozen mouse and human liver sections, as well as primary hepatocytes. We used several different antibodies recognizing human and mouse ABCC6.

"The microsporidian Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei was first described from Thailand in 2009 in farmed, indigenous giant tiger shrimp Penaeus (Penaeus) monodon. The natural reservoir for the parasite is still unknown. More recently, a microsporidian closely resembling it in morphology and tissue preference was found in Thai-farmed, exotic, whiteleg shrimp Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei exhibiting white feces syndrome (WFS). Our objective was to compare the newly found pathogen with E. hepatopenaei and to determine its causal relationship with WFS. Generic primers used to amplify a fragment of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssu rRNA) gene for cloning and sequencing revealed that the new parasite from WFS ponds had 99% sequence identity to that of E. hepatopenaei, suggesting it was conspecific. Normal histological analysis using tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) revealed that relatively few tubule epithelial cells exhibited spores, suggesting that the infections were light. However, the H&E results were deceptive since nested PCR and in situ hybridization analysis based on the cloned ssu rRNA gene fragment revealed very heavy infections in tubule epithelial cells in the central region of the hepatopancreas in the absence of spores. Despite these results, high prevalence of E. hepatopenaei in shrimp from ponds not exhibiting WFS and a pond that had recovered from WFS indicated no direct causal association between these infections and WFS. This was supported by laboratory oral challenge trials that revealed direct horizontal transmission to uninfected shrimp but no signs of WFS.",Is the microsporidian Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei the cause of white feces syndrome in whiteleg shrimp Penaeus ( Litopenaeus ) vannamei?,"The microsporidian newly found in P. vannamei is conspecific with previously described E. hepatopenaei and it is not causally associated with WFS.

"Livin, a member of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins, is expressed in variable cancers, and its expression is considered a poor prognostic marker. The aims of this study were to observe the effect of Livin on the behaviors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and to evaluate its expression in HCC tissues and its relation to prognosis. The biological effects of Livin on tumor cell behavior were investigated using siRNA in HepG2 and Chang cells. Migration, invasion and proliferation assays were performed.

LVH (left ventricular [LV] mass/body surface area > or = 117 g/m2 in men and > or = 104 g/m2 in women) was present in 84 men (52%) and 119 women (44%). During a mean of 5 years' follow-up (range, 0 to 9), 49 patients (26 men and 23 women) died. The mortality rate was 5.40 per 100 patient-years in men with LVH and 2.58 in men without LVH (crude relative risk [RR] = 2.09) and 3.21 and 0.66, respectively, in women (RR = 4.87). In Cox regression analysis, adjusting for age, hypertension, and ejection fraction, the RR of total death for LVH versus non-LVH was 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8 to 5.0) in men and 14.3 (95% CI, 1.6 to 11.7) in women. For cardiac death, RR was 1.3 (95% CI, 0.4 to 3.7) and 7.5 (95% CI, 1.6 to 33.8) in men and women, respectively. Analyses using LV mass indexed by height or height with the use of different LVH cut points, comparing patients in the highest sex-specific tertile of mass index to those in the lower two tertiles, and the use of LV mass indexes as continuous variables similarly demonstrated a greater increase in risk of either fatal end point among women than men.",Does left ventricular hypertrophy have a greater impact on survival in women than in men?,These findings indicate a sex difference in the contribution of LV mass and hypertrophy to mortality in the absence of coronary artery disease.,1,1.

"Environmental risk factors together with genetic vulnerability create a complex background to develop depression. We investigated the associations between COMT Val(158)Met and depression in a Swedish population-based sample of 405 depressed individuals (major depression diagnosis, dysthymia or mixed anxiety depression defined according to DSM-IV) and 2,151 healthy controls. We also analyzed interaction between this genetic variation and some environmental risk factors for depression and the link between this polymorphism and the low motivational level and negative mood state found in depressed individuals. Depressed individuals displayed a higher frequency of the Met/Met and Met/Val genotypes compared to controls (OR=1.49, CI(95%)=1.11-2.00, P=0.009). The association was found among men only (OR=2.26, CI(95%)=1.26-4.05, p=0.008).

"Medical schools struggle with large classes, which might interfere with the effectiveness of learning within small groups due to students being unfamiliar to fellow students. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of making a large class seem small on the students' collaborative learning processes. A randomised controlled intervention study was undertaken to make a large class seem small, without the need to reduce the number of students enrolling in the medical programme. The class was divided into subsets: two small subsets (n=50) as the intervention groups; a control group (n=102) was mixed with the remaining students (the non-randomised group n∼100) to create one large subset. The undergraduate curriculum of the Maastricht Medical School, applying the Problem-Based Learning principles. In this learning context, students learn mainly in tutorial groups, composed randomly from a large class every 6-10 weeks. The formal group learning activities were organised within the subsets. Students from the intervention groups met frequently within the formal groups, in contrast to the students from the large subset who hardly enrolled with the same students in formal activities. Three outcome measures assessed students' group learning processes over time: learning within formally organised small groups, learning with other students in the informal context and perceptions of the intervention. Formal group learning processes were perceived more positive in the intervention groups from the second study year on, with a mean increase of β=0.48. Informal group learning activities occurred almost exclusively within the subsets as defined by the intervention from the first week involved in the medical curriculum (E-I indexes>-0.69).

"Elastin-like polypeptides are synthetic biopolymers composed of a repeating pentapeptide 'VPGXG' sequence that are valuable for the simple non-chromatographic purification of recombinant proteins. In addition, elastin-like polypeptide fusions have been shown to enhance the accumulation of a range of different recombinant proteins in plants, thus addressing the major limitation of plant-based expression systems, which is a low production yield. This study's main objectives were to determine the general utility of elastin-like polypeptide protein fusions in various intracellular compartments and to elucidate elastin-like polypeptide's mechanism of action for increasing recombinant protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum of plants. The effect of elastin-like polypeptide fusions on the accumulation of green fluorescent protein targeted to the cytoplasm, chloroplasts, apoplast, and endoplasmic reticulum was evaluated. The endoplasmic reticulum was the only intracellular compartment in which an elastin-like polypeptide tag was shown to significantly enhance recombinant protein accumulation. Interestingly, endoplasmic reticulum-targeted elastin-like polypeptide fusions induced the formation of a novel type of protein body, which may be responsible for elastin-like polypeptide's positive effect on recombinant protein accumulation by excluding the heterologous protein from normal physiological turnover. Although expressed in the leaves of plants, these novel protein bodies appeared similar in size and morphology to the prolamin-based protein bodies naturally found in plant seeds. The elastin-like polypeptide-induced protein bodies were highly mobile organelles, exhibiting various dynamic patterns of movement throughout the cells, which were dependent on intact actin microfilaments and a functional actomyosin motility system.",Does induction of protein body formation in plant leave by elastin-like polypeptide fusions?,"An endoplasmic reticulum-targeted elastin-like polypeptide fusion approach provides an effective strategy for depositing large amounts of concentrated heterologous protein within the limited space of the cell via storage in stable protein bodies. Furthermore, encapsulation of recombinant proteins into physiologically inert organelles can function to insulate the protein from normal cellular mechanisms, thus limiting unnecessary stress to the host cell. Since elastin-like polypeptide is a mammalian-derived protein, this study demonstrates that plant seed-specific factors are not required for the formation of protein bodies in vegetative plant tissues, suggesting that the endoplasmic reticulum possesses an intrinsic ability to form protein body-like accretions in eukaryotic cells when overexpressing particular proteins.",1,1.

"Helicobacter pylori uses SabA to interact with sialyl-Lewis x on the gastric mucosal surface to establish persistent colonization. The number of CT repeats in sabA is variable and thus influences SabA translation, but the expression of SabA determined by Western blotting does not fully match with a CT sequence-based prediction. Furthermore, a homopolymeric thymidine (polyT) tract located upstream of sabA has been observed, but its role in regulating sabA expression is still unknown. The transcriptional start site (TSS) of sabA in strains J99 and Hp258 was determined by 5' RACE. One hundred and fifteen clinical isolates were sequenced to analyze the distribution of the polyT tract length and promoter sequence. Finally, RT-PCR and an E. coli-lux reporter system were used to determine the sabA promoter activity with different lengths of the polyT tract. The TSS of sabA was located at 66 or 64 bp upstream of the translational start codon in J99 and Hp258, respectively. The polyT tract close to the -35 element varied from T₁₀ to T₂₈ in 115 clinical isolates, and 70% of the isolates contained a stretch of 14-19 Ts. The sabA gene displayed slipped strand mispairing (SSM) of the polyT tract, generating varying genotypes in J99 (16-18 Ts) and Hp258 (14-15 Ts).

"The purpose of this study was to determine the rates and predictors of HIV testing and receipt of results among homeless adults with serious mental illness in the initial 3-month period after contact with a community-based case management program. Baseline and follow-up interview data came from clients (N=5,890) in the Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports program, an 18-site, 5-year federally sponsored demonstration designed to evaluate the effect of service system integration on outcomes for homeless persons with serious mental illness. Overall, 38.0% of clients were tested for HIV in the 3 months after program entry; of these, 88.8% returned to receive their test results. Likelihood of being tested was independently associated with having been tested before, more severe psychiatric symptoms and drug problems, level of worry about getting AIDS, younger age, less education, minority status, longer-term homelessness, being sexually assaulted, being arrested, and health services utilization. Among those tested, likelihood of receiving the test results was higher among those with a history of prior testing and return for results, a higher frequency of testing, and more years of education and lower among those with drug abuse problems, outpatient medical service utilization, disability, and sexually transmitted disease.

"The 5-7% of adults in the United States with severe mental illness (SMI), especially the 50% who are 'dually diagnosed' with co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD), are at an elevated risk of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, little is known about HIV/HCV co-infection in this population. This paper examines the prevalence and correlates of HIV, hepatitis C, and HIV/HCV co-infection in a large, multisite sample of SMI clients. We conducted a re-analysis of data on prevalence and correlates of blood-borne infections in a multisite sample of SMI clients. In 1997-1998, 755 SMI clients were tested for HIV, hepatitis B virus and HCV, and assessed for demographic, illness-related and other behavioral risk factors for blood-borne infections. The prevalence and correlates of co-infection were examined, as well as the knowledge, attitudes and risk behaviors of individuals with HCV mono-infection. Of the 755 participants, 623 (82.5%) were negative for both HIV and HCV, 23 (3.0%) were positive for HIV, 109 (14.4%) were positive for HCV, and 13 (1.7%) were co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, 2.5% of dually diagnosed participants were co-infected, whereas only 0.6% of SMI participants without a comorbid SUD diagnosis were co-infected. Co-infection was associated with psychiatric illness severity, ongoing drug abuse, poverty, homelessness, incarceration, urban residence and minority status.

"The cell and molecular biology of heart valve wound repair is not well understood. Valve interstitial cells (IC) are thought to play an important role in valvular wound repair. Because nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in wound repair, we tested the hypothesis that NO promotes valvular wound repair by examining the presence of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in wounded IC monolayers, in vitro. Linear denuding wounds were made in confluent monolayers of porcine mitral valve IC plated on glass coverslips. Cultures were fixed at various times (0 to 48 h postwounding), and iNOS was localized in the cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cultures were also incubated with iNOS inhibitors L-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and N-(3-(Aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine (1400W), and the extent of wound closure with and without inhibitor was measured at 24, 48 and 72 h postwounding. From 6 to 24 h postwounding, iNOS localization was increased at the wound edge. At 48 h, iNOS was localized beyond the wound edge, into the monolayer, where the intensity of the signal gradually diminished until it was virtually imperceptible. At 24 and 48 h, the inhibition of iNOS with both L-NAME and 1400W resulted in a significant delay in wound closure.",Does nitric oxide promote in vitro interstitial cell heart valve repair?,NO promotes valve wound repair through an effect on IC migration.,1,Does nitric oxide facilitate the repair of interstitial cells in heart valves in vitro?,16.0,2294.0,2443.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.05668306350708,2.2151994705200195,4.333333492279053,"Yes, nitric oxide promotes in vitro interstitial cell heart valve repair, as indicated by the increased localization of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) at the wound edge and the significant delay in wound closure when iNOS was inhibited.",0.8
"Percutaneous biopsy obtained from a single location is prone to sampling error in large heterogeneous renal masses, leading to nondiagnostic results or failure to detect poor prognostic features. We evaluated the accuracy of percutaneous biopsy for large renal masses using a modified multi-quadrant technique vs a standard biopsy technique. Clinical and pathological data for all patients with cT2 or greater renal masses who underwent percutaneous biopsy from 2009 to 2014 were reviewed. The multi-quadrant technique was defined as multiple core biopsies from at least 4 separate solid enhancing areas in the tumor. The incidence of nondiagnostic findings, sarcomatoid features and procedural complications was recorded, and concordance between biopsy specimens and nephrectomy pathology was compared. A total of 122 biopsies were performed for 117 tumors in 116 patients (46 using the standard biopsy technique and 76 using the multi-quadrant technique). Median tumor size was 10 cm (IQR 8-12). Biopsy was nondiagnostic in 5 of 46 (10.9%) standard and 0 of 76 (0%) multi-quadrant biopsies (p=0.007). Renal cell carcinoma was identified in 96 of 115 (82.0%) tumors and nonrenal cell carcinoma tumors were identified in 21 (18.0%). One complication occurred using the standard biopsy technique and no complications were reported using the multi-quadrant technique. Sarcomatoid features were present in 23 of 96 (23.9%) large renal cell carcinomas studied.

"Photoreceptor degeneration is normally accompanied by reactive gliosis and gene expression changes in Müller (glial) cells. The signaling pathway involved inducing these changes in Müller cells is not known. It has been proposed that endothelin2 (EDN2) released by degenerating photoreceptors might induce gliotic changes in Müller cells. In the present study, we directly tested the hypothesis by determining whether treatment of Müller cell cultures with EDN2 results in upregulation of genes known to be expressed in activated Müller cells in vivo. Experiments were carried using an established rat Müller cell line (rMC-1), and gene expression was assessed by qRT-PCR. We observed that EDN2 treatment upregulated transcripts for glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap), Serpina3n and endothelin receptor B (EdnrB), three genes associated with reactive gliosis in Müller cells.

"We assessed in a randomized prospective trial the effectiveness of Graftskin, a living skin equivalent, in treating noninfected nonischemic chronic plantar diabetic foot ulcers. In 24 centers in the U.S., 208 patients were randomly assigned to ulcer treatment either with Graftskin (112 patients) or saline-moistened gauze (96 patients, control group). Standard state-of-the-art adjunctive therapy, which included extensive surgical debridement and adequate foot off-loading, was provided in both groups. Graftskin was applied at the beginning of the study and weekly thereafter for a maximum of 4 weeks (maximum of five applications) or earlier if complete healing occurred. The major outcome of complete wound healing was assessed by intention to treat at the 12-week follow-up visit.

"Upper abdominal pain is a dominant feature of chronic pancreatitis. A key phenomenon in this context is hyperalgesia, typically associated with N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation. This exploratory study evaluates acute effects of S-ketamine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist, in modulating generalized hyperalgesia in chronic pancreatitis pain. In a blinded crossover trial, 10 chronic pancreatitis pain patients received S-ketamine for 3 hrs at 2 μg · kg · min or placebo infusion at an equivalent rate in randomized order.

The goal of this study is to determine whether cellular Vit E bioavailability and its transport proteins are important contributing factors. alpha-Vit E and its ester form, VES, were used to treat prostate cancer LNCaP, PC3, and DU145 cells, and their growth rates were determined by MTT assay. Cellular levels of Vit E were quantified using HPLC as the index of bioavailability. The expression levels of Vit E transport proteins were determined by real-time PCR. Among these PCa cells, only LNCaP cells were sensitive to 20 microM alpha-Vit E treatment, while both LNCaP and PC3 cells were sensitive to 20 microM VES treatment. Coordinately, cellular levels of alpha-Vit E and VES positively correlated to their inhibitory effects. Further study found expression levels of Vit E transport proteins, including tocopherol associated protein (TAP), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (TTP), and ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), were different in various PCa cells, which may contribute to cellular Vit E bioavailability. This notion is further supported by the findings that overexpression or knockdown of TTP could coordinately alter cellular alpha-Vit E levels in PCa cells.",Is differential retention of alpha-vitamin E correlated with its transporter gene expression and growth inhibition efficacy in prostate cancer cells?,Antiproliferative efficacy of alpha-Vit E is correlated with its cellular bioavailability in PCa cells.

"Protein arginine methyltransferase-5 (PRMT5) is a chromatin-modifying enzyme capable of methylating histone and non-histone proteins, and is involved in a wide range of cellular processes that range from transcriptional regulation to organelle biosynthesis. As such, its overexpression has been linked to tumor suppressor gene silencing, enhanced tumor cell growth and survival. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western immunoblot and immunohistochemistry were used to characterize PRMT5 expression in lung cancer cell lines and human tumors. Clinicopathological findings of tissue microarray based samples from 229 patients with non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) and 133 cases with pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (NET) were analyzed with regard to nuclear and cytoplasmic PRMT5 expression. There was statistically significant difference in PRMT5 messenger RNA expression between tumors and nonneoplastic lung tissues. Immunoblot experiments showed abundant expression of PRMT5 and its symmetric methylation mark H4R3 in lung carcinoma but not in non-neoplastic human pulmonary alveolar and bronchial epithelial cell lines. More than two thirds of lung tumors expressed PRMT5. High levels of cytoplasmic PRMT5 were detected in 20.5% of NSCLC and in 16.5% of NET; high levels of nuclear PRMT5 were detected in 38.0% of NSCLC and 24.0% of NET. Cytoplasmic PRMT5 was associated with high grade in both NSCLC and pulmonary NET while nuclear PRMT5 was more frequent in carcinoid tumors (p < 0.05).",Does cellular localization of protein arginine methyltransferase-5 correlate with grade of lung tumors?,The observed findings support the role of PRMT5 in lung tumorigenesis and reflect its functional dichotomy in cellular compartments.,1,1.

"The enzymatic degradation of lignocellulosic materials by fungal enzyme systems has been extensively studied due to its effectiveness in the liberation of fermentable sugars for bioethanol production. Recently, variants of the fungus Penicillium echinulatum have been described as a great producer of cellulases and considered a promising strain for the bioethanol industry. Penicillium echinulatum, wild-type 2HH and its mutant strain S1M29, were grown on four different carbon sources: cellulose, sugar cane bagasse pretreated by steam explosion (SCB), glucose, and glycerol for 120 h. Samples collected at 24, 96, and 120 h were used for enzymatic measurement, and the 96-h one was also used for secretome analysis by 1D-PAGE LC-MS/MS. A total of 165 proteins were identified, and more than one-third of these proteins belong to CAZy families. Glycosyl hydrolases (GH) are the most abundant group, being represented in larger quantities by GH3, 5, 17, 43, and 72. Cellobiohydrolases, endoglucanases, β-glycosidases, xylanases, β-xylosidases, and mannanases were found, and in minor quantities, pectinases, ligninases, and amylases were also found.

"The mechanisms whereby intracellular messengers mediate zymogen granule transport and exocytosis in the pancreatic acinar cell are not well defined. Electron microscopy has shown a periluminal network of actin in the acinar cell, suggesting a role for actin and myosin in the transport process. The possible involvement of two types of myosin in the secretory process was investigated, and their distribution in acinar cells was determined. Antibodies specific to myosin I or to myosin II were used for immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. Ultrastructural studies were also performed. Western blot analysis showed that myosin I and myosin II were present in total pancreatic homogenate but that only myosin I was present on isolated zymogen granules and their membranes.

"Microarray analyses allow the identification and assessment of molecular signatures in whole tissues undergoing pathological processes. To better understand cerebral malaria pathogenesis, we investigated intra-cerebral gene-expression profiles in well-defined genetically cerebral malaria-resistant (CM-R) and CM-susceptible (CM-S) mice, upon infection by Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA). We investigated mouse transcriptional responses at early and late stages of infection by use of cDNA microarrays. Through a rigorous statistical approach with multiple testing corrections, we showed that PbA significantly altered brain gene expression in CM-R (BALB/c), and in CM-S (CBA/J and C57BL/6) mice, and that 327 genes discriminated between early and late infection stages, between mouse strains, and between CM-R and CM-S mice. We further identified 104, 56, 84 genes with significant differential expression between CM-R and CM-S mice on days 2, 5, and 7 respectively. The analysis of their functional annotation indicates that genes involved in metabolic energy pathways, the inflammatory response, and the neuroprotection/neurotoxicity balance play a major role in cerebral malaria pathogenesis.

"Recent studies have shown that women experience an acceleration of cognitive problems after menopause and that estrogen treatment can improve or at least maintain current levels of cognitive functioning in postmenopausal women. However, we have previously shown that the negative emotional effects of psychosocial stress are magnified in normal postmenopausal women after estrogen treatment. This study examined whether estradiol (E2) administration can modify cognitive performance after exposure to psychological stress and monoamine depletion. Participants consisted of 22 postmenopausal women placed on either oral placebo or 17beta-E2 (1 mg/d for 1 mo, then 2 mg/d for 2 mo). At the end of the 3-month treatment phase, participants underwent three depletion challenges in which they ingested one of three amino acid mixtures: deficient in tryptophan, deficient in phenylalanine/tyrosine, or balanced. Five hours later, participants performed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), followed by mood and anxiety ratings and cognitive testing. Cognitive measures included tests of attention, psychomotor function, and verbal episodic memory. E2-treated compared with placebo-treated participants exhibited significant worsening of cognitive performance on tasks measuring attentional performance and psychomotor speed. Similar trends for impairment were seen in measures of long-term episodic memory compared with placebo-treated postmenopausal women. E2-treated participants also showed a significant increase in negative mood and anxiety compared with placebo-treated women after, but not before, the TSST, although the worsening of both cognitive and behavioral functioning was not correlated. These effects were independent of tryptophan or tyrosine/phenylalanine depletion and were not manifested before the TSST or at baseline.",Does estrogen treatment impair cognitive performance after psychosocial stress and monoamine depletion in postmenopausal women?,These data suggest that the relationship between estrogen administration and cognitive/behavioral performance in postmenopausal women may be more complex than initially appreciated and that the effects of psychosocial stress may influence whether hormone effects are beneficial.,1,1.

"Laboratory tests including optical platelet aggregometry (OPA), platelet function analyser (PFA-100), and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) metabolite levels have been used to define aspirin resistance. This study characterised the prevalence of aspirin resistance in patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and investigated the concordance and repeatability of these tests. Consecutive outpatients with stable IHD were enrolled. They were commenced on 150 mg aspirin daily (day 0) and had platelet function assessment (OPA and PFA-100) and quantitative analysis of serum/urine TXB2 at day > or =7 and then at a second visit approximately 2 weeks later. We assessed the prevalence of aspirin resistance by each method, concordance between methods of measuring response to aspirin and association between time points to assess the predictability of response over time. 172 patients (62.7 (SD 8.7) years, 83.1% male) were recruited. At visits 1 and 2, respectively, 1.7% and 4.7% were aspirin resistant by OPA, whereas 22.1% and 20.3% were aspirin resistant by PFA-100.

"The interaction of platelets with low density lipoprotein (LDL) contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease.

"KCNQ1 (alias KvLQT1 or Kv7.1) and KCNE1 (alias IsK or minK) co-assemble to form the voltage-activated K(+) channel responsible for I(Ks)-a major repolarizing current in the human heart-and their dysfunction promotes cardiac arrhythmias. The channel is a component of larger macromolecular complexes containing known and undefined regulatory proteins. Thus, identification of proteins that modulate its biosynthesis, localization, activity, and/or degradation is of great interest from both a physiological and pathological point of view. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening, we detected a direct interaction between beta-tubulin and the KCNQ1 N-terminus. The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of beta-tubulin and KCNQ1 in transfected COS-7 cells and in guinea pig cardiomyocytes. Using immunocytochemistry, we also found that they co-localized in cardiomyocytes. We tested the effects of microtubule-disrupting and -stabilizing agents (colchicine and taxol, respectively) on the KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel activity in COS-7 cells by means of the permeabilized-patch configuration of the patch-clamp technique. None of these agents altered I(Ks). In addition, colchicine did not modify the current response to osmotic challenge.

"The ability to predict intensive care unit length of stay greatly facilitates triage and resource allocation for postoperative cardiac surgical patients in the intensive care unit. We developed a simple, intuitive Surgical Procedure Assessment score that integrates surgical complexity (1, low; 2, intermediate; 3, high) with patient comorbidity (A, minimal; B, substantial). We hypothesized that the Surgical Procedure Assessment score would predict intensive care unit length of stay, discriminate preoperatively between fast-track and prolonged-stay patients, and compare favorably with more complex risk scores. After institutional review board approval, 1201 cardiac surgical patients were preoperatively assigned a Surgical Procedure Assessment score, as well as a Parsonnet, Tuman, Tu, and Cardiac Anesthesia Risk Evaluation score. We compared these scores with regard to prediction of intensive care unit length of stay, as well as their concordance in predicting intensive care unit length of stay of less than 48 hours (fast track) and more than 7 days (prolonged stay). Intensive care unit length of stay increased significantly with increasing Surgical Procedure Assessment scores (P < .01, Cuzick's test for trend).

"Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) is important in mobilising neutrophils from the bone marrow but also has a range of proinflammatory effects. We therefore decided to investigate the role of GCSF in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitis. We measured GCSF levels in the serum of 38 patients with active ANCA vasculitis compared with 31 age-matched controls, and assessed the effect of GCSF priming on the response of human neutrophils to ANCA. We also examined the effect of exogenous GCSF administration in a murine model of antimyeloperoxidase (anti-MPO) vasculitis, and the effect of GCSF on murine neutrophil activation.

"Studies have proposed two opposing roles for copper-bound forms of prion protein (PrP) as an anti-oxidant supporting the neuronal functions and as a pro-oxidant leading to neurodegenerative process involving the generation of reactive oxygen species. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis in which putative copper-binding peptides derived from PrP function as possible catalysts for monoamine-dependent conversion of hydrogen peroxide to superoxide in vitro. Four peptides corresponding to the copper (II)-binding motifs in PrP were synthesized and used for analysis of peptide-catalyzed generation of superoxide in the presence of Cu (II) and other factors naturally present in the neuronal tissues. Among the Cu-binding peptides tested, the amino acid sequence corresponding to the Cu-binding site in the helical region was shown to be the most active for superoxide generation in the presence of Cu(II), hydrogen peroxide and aromatic monoamines, known precursors or intermediates of neurotransmitters.

"To investigate the role of Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) in osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function. Bone destruction was analysed in arthritic knee joints of several FcγR-knockout mouse strains. Unfractionated bone marrow cells were differentiated in vitro towards osteoclasts in the absence or presence of immune complexes (ICs) and stimulated thereafter for 24 h with tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition, mature osteoclasts were stimulated with ICs. Experiments were analysed for osteoclast formation, bone resorption and the expression of FcγRs and osteoclast markers. Bone destruction was significantly increased in arthritic knee joints of FcγRIIB-deficient mice. All FcγR classes were highly expressed on osteoclast precursors. Expression of the inhibitory FcγRIIB was similar on mature osteoclasts compared to macrophages, whereas activating FcγR levels were significantly lower. IC stimulation of mature osteoclasts did not affect their number or their bone resorptive capacity. ICs significantly inhibited differentiation of unfractionated bone marrow cells towards osteoclasts, bone resorption and expression of osteoclast markers. In the presence of ICs, osteoclastogenesis of FcγRIIB(-/-) precursors and bone resorption remained inhibited.

"Failure of hypertension treatment is a major clinical issue because of the high prevalence and the associated mortality risk. We have reported evidence that creatine kinase increases blood pressure through greater sodium retention and cardiovascular contractility, by rapidly providing ATP for these functions. Therefore, we hypothesized that high creatine kinase is associated with failure of antihypertensive treatment. We analyzed a cross-sectional, random multiethnic sample of the general population (N = 1444), aged 34-60 years. The primary outcome was the independent association between resting serum creatine kinase and treated uncontrolled hypertension in the population, using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Hypertension prevalence was, respectively, 26.8; 30.8; and 41.2% for the lowest (<88 IU/l) through the highest population creatine kinase tertile (>145 IU/l; P < 0.001). Treatment failed in 72.9% of participants within the highest creatine kinase tertile vs. 46.7% within the lowest tertile (P = 0.004).

"To determine whether women experiencing recurrent miscarriage were more likely to have a family history of cardiovascular disease. Retrospective cohort study. Women having a first birth in Scotland between 1992 and 2006. A total of 74, 730 first births were linked to the hospital admission and death certification data for the women's parents through the women's birth certificates. The incidence of cardiovascular disease in the women's parents was related to the number of miscarriages experienced before their daughters' first births using a Cox proportional hazards model. Death or hospital admission of the women's parents for ischaemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD) or venous thromboembolism (VTE). There was an increased incidence of IHD in the parents of women who experienced two miscarriages before their first birth (hazard ratio 1.25, 95% CI 1.04-1.49) and parents of women who experienced three or more miscarriages before their first birth (hazard ratio 1.56, 95% CI 1.14-2.15).

"Transient nonfocal neurological symptoms may serve as markers of cardiac dysfunction. We assessed whether serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, a biomarker of cardiac disease, are increased in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) accompanied by nonfocal symptoms and in patients with attacks of nonfocal symptoms (transient neurological attack [TNA]). We included 15 patients with TNA, 69 with TIA accompanied by nonfocal symptoms, 58 with large-vessel TIA, 32 with cardioembolic TIA, and 46 age- and sex-matched healthy control participants.

We compared log-transformed NT-proBNP levels of patients with cardioembolic TIAs and mixed or nonfocal TNAs, with those of patients with noncardioembolic TIAs as a reference group. Adjustments for age, sex, atrial fibrillation, and a history of nonischemic heart disease were made with a multiple linear regression model. Compared with large-vessel TIA (mean 14.2 pmol/L), mean NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in patients with TIA accompanied by nonfocal symptoms (40.5 pmol/L, P=0.049) and with cardioembolic TIA (123.5 pmol/L; P=0.004) after adjustments for age, sex, atrial fibrillation, and a history of nonischemic heart disease.

"Plasmodium falciparum invades human erythrocytes by using an array of ligands that interact with several receptors, including sialic acid (SA), complement receptor 1 (CR1), and basigin. We hypothesized that in malaria-endemic areas, parasites vary invasion pathways under immune pressure. Therefore, invasion mechanisms of clinical isolates collected from 3 zones of Ghana with different levels of endemicity (from lowest to highest, Accra, Navrongo, and Kintampo) were compared using standardized methods. Blood samples were collected from children aged 2-14 years in whom malaria was diagnosed, and erythrocyte invasion phenotypes were determined using the enzymes neuraminidase, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, which differentially cleave receptors from the erythrocyte surface. In addition, antibodies against CR1 and basigin were used to determine the contributions of these receptors to invasion. Gene expression levels of P. falciparum invasion ligands were also examined. The parasites generally expressed SA-independent invasion phenotypes across the malaria-endemic areas, with parasites from Kintampo showing the highest invasion rates in neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes. CR1 was a major mediator of SA-independent invasion, while basigin was essential for both SA-dependent and SA-independent invasion mechanisms. Furthermore, expression of the basigin ligand PfRh5 was the best predictor of donor parasitemia.",Does analysis of Erythrocyte Invasion Mechanisms of Plasmodium falciparum Clinical isolate Across 3 Malaria-Endemic Areas in Ghana?,"Erythrocyte invasion phenotypes expressed by P. falciparum are influenced by endemicity levels, and the PfRh5-basigin pathway is a potential vaccine target.",1,1.

"Chronic liver disease mediated by activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) leads to liver fibrosis. Here, we postulated that the immune regulatory properties of HSCs might promote the profibrogenic activity of B cells. Fibrosis is completely attenuated in carbon tetrachloride-treated, B cell-deficient µMT mice, showing that B cells are required. The retinoic acid produced by HSCs augmented B-cell survival, plasma cell marker CD138 expression, and immunoglobulin G production. These activities were reversed following addition of the retinoic acid inhibitor LE540. Transcriptional profiling of fibrotic liver B cells revealed increased expression of genes related to activation of nuclear factor κ light chain enhancer of activated B cells, proinflammatory cytokine production, and CD40 signaling, suggesting that these B cells are activated and may be acting as inflammatory cells. Biological validation experiments also revealed increased activation (CD44 and CD86 expression), constitutive immunoglobulin G production, and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Likewise, targeted deletion of B-cell-intrinsic myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 signaling, an innate adaptor with involvement in retinoic acid signaling, resulted in reduced infiltration of migratory CD11c(+) dendritic cells and Ly6C(++) monocytes and, hence, reduced liver pathology.",Does liver fibrosis occur through dysregulation of MyD88-dependent innate B-cell activity?,"Liver fibrosis occurs through a mechanism of HSC-mediated augmentation of innate B-cell activity.

"We sought to determine whether endothelium-derived relaxing factor (nitric oxide) exerts a tonic vasodilating effect on coronary collateral channels developed in response to myocardial ischemia. Although the coronary collateral circulation is known to react to several vasoactive agents, the role of endogenously produced nitric oxide is unclear. Coronary collateral channels were induced in the left circumflex artery bed of 12 chronically instrumented dogs by either ameroid implantation or repeated occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery. With the native circumflex artery occluded, aortic and circumflex pressures and microsphere flows were measured before and after systemic administration of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, an arginine analogue known to block the synthesis of nitric oxide. NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased mean aortic pressure from a mean +/- SEM of 92 +/- 4 to 114 +/- 4 mm Hg, whereas pressure in the occluded circumflex artery decreased from 61 +/- 4 to 55 +/- 4 mm Hg. The increase in aortic-circumflex pressure gradient (from 31 +/- 4 to 59 +/- 5 mm Hg) was accompanied by a decrease in flow in the circumflex bed (from 1.31 to +/- 0.14 to 1.09 +/- 0.15 ml/min per g), resulting in an increase in coronary collateral resistance averaging 173 +/- 37% (from 26 +/- 4 to 64 +/- 9 mm Hg/ml per min per g, p < 0.01).

"Extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover plays an important role in left ventricular (LV) remodelling following myocardial infarction (MI). Cysteinyl cathepsins contribute to ECM catabolism in arterial diseases, suggesting their participation in post-MI remodelling. Left anterior descending artery ligation-induced MI in mice showed increased expression and activity of cathepsin S (CatS). Administration of a non-selective cathepsin inhibitor, E64d, aggravated LV dysfunction at 7 and 28 days post-MI. Mechanistic studies showed that E64d increased post-MI inflammatory cell accumulation and cytokine expression, but did not affect apoptosis or angiogenesis in infarcted myocardium. Furthermore, E64d suppressed TGF-β1-induced Smad2 and Smad3 activation and expression of fibronectin extra domain A (ED-A), an alternatively spliced fibronectin variant, and subsequently prevented cardiac fibroblast trans-differentiation into myofibroblast, which contributed to post-MI collagen and fibronectin synthesis and deposition. Consistently, selective inhibition or genetically determined deficiency of CatS also reduced myocardial Smad2 and Smad3 activation and ED-A fibronectin expression, thus suppressing fibroblast trans-differentiation and resulting in adverse collagen turnover and impaired cardiac function-recapitulating the findings in mice treated with E64d.",Does cathepsin S-mediated fibroblast trans-differentiation contribute to left ventricular remodelling after myocardial infarction?,"Along with its established activities in ECM degradation, CatS plays novel roles in TGF-β1 signalling, myofibroblast trans-differentiation, and ECM protein synthesis, thereby regulating scar formation in the infarcted myocardium and preserving LV function after experimental MI.",1,1.

"Despite the importance of Treg cells in the maintenance of immunologic tolerance, the mechanisms that control their generation and activity are unknown. Since the cell cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1) (p27) was involved in T cell anergy, we undertook this study to explore its role in both Treg cell processes. The development of type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and lupus-like abnormalities was compared between transgenic mice overexpressing human Bcl-2 in T cells (BCL2-TgT mice) and nontransgenic mice that were deficient or not deficient in p27. The contribution of Treg cells to disease evolution was also explored. Finally, the in vitro activity of Treg cells and their differentiation from naive CD4+ cells was compared between these strains of mice. BCL2-TgT mice were protected against CIA by a Treg cell-dependent mechanism. In association with this protection, the overexpression of Bcl-2 in T cells enhanced the differentiation and activity of Treg cells. Both Bcl-2 effects were independent of its antiapoptotic activity but dependent on its capacity to induce the expression of p27 that augmented the strength of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling in T cells. Accordingly, down-modulation of p27 expression in BCL2-TgT mice promoted CIA. In addition, p27 deficiency in aged C57BL/6 mice reduced the number and activity of Treg cells and induced the development of mild lupus-like abnormalities.",Does p27 ( Kip1 ) inhibit systemic autoimmunity through the control of Treg cell activity and differentiation?,Our results point to p27 as a critical regulator of Treg cell differentiation and function through the positive modulation of TGFβ signaling strength in T cells.,1,1.

"Bisphosphonates are an important class of antiresorptive drugs used in the treatment of metabolic bone diseases. Recent studies have shown that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates induced apoptosis in rabbit osteoclasts and prevented prenylated small GTPase. However, whether bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast formation has not been determined. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of minodronate and alendronate on the osteoclast formation and clarified the mechanism involved in a mouse macrophage-like cell lines C7 and RAW264.7. It was found that minodronate and alendronate inhibited the osteoclast formation of C7 cells induced by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand and macrophage colony stimulating factor, which are inhibited by the suppression of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) biosynthesis. It was also found that minodronate and alendronate inhibited the osteoclast formation of RAW264.7 cells induced by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand. Furthermore, minodronate and alendornate decreased phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt; similarly, U0126, a mitogen protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor, and LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, inhibited osteoclast formation.",Do nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates inhibit RANKL- and M-CSF-induced osteoclast formation through the inhibition of ERK1/2 and Akt activation?,"This indicates that minodronate and alendronate inhibit GGPP biosynthesis in the mevalonate pathway and then signal transduction in the MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways, thereby inhibiting osteoclast formation.

"A long oral exposure to food and a high-energy density of food have been shown to increase satiety feelings. The effect of energy density is predominantly caused by an inhibition of gastric emptying. It is hypothesized that prolonging oral exposure may have an additional effect on this inhibition of gastric emptying. However, little human data are available to support this hypothesis. The objective was to assess the effect of the duration of oral exposure to food on gastric emptying rate of gastric loads (GLs) low and high in energy density and on satiety feelings. Twenty-six healthy men [mean ± SD age: 22 ± 3 y; BMI (in kg/m(2)): 23 ± 1] participated in a randomized crossover trial with 4 treatments and a control. Treatments consisted of either 1- or 8-min modified sham feeding (MSF) of cake, and a GL of either 100 or 700 kcal infused in the stomach via a nasogastric tube (500 mL, 62.5 mL/min). The control consisted of no MSF and a GL of 500 mL of water. Gastric emptying rate was assessed with a (13)C breath test. Breath samples and satiety feelings were collected at fixed time points until 90 min after start of the treatment. Gastric emptying rate and satiety feelings were not affected by duration of MSF (P ≥ 0.27). However, the 700-kcal GL treatments slowed gastric emptying [41% lower area under the curve (AUC)] and increased satiety feelings (22-31% higher AUC) compared with the 100-kcal GL treatments (P < 0.001).

"In advanced atherosclerosis, chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces foam cells apoptosis and generates inflammatory reactions. THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells (FC) were incubated with 1 mM 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). After ALA mediated sonodynamic therapy (ALA-SDT), apoptosis of FC was assayed by Annexin V-PI staining. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by staining with CellROX® Green Reagent and jc-1. Pretreatment of FC with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), Z-VAD-FMK or 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), mitochondria apoptotic pathway associated proteins and C/EBP-homologous (CHOP) expressions were assayed by wertern blotting. Burst of apoptosis of FC was observed at 5-hour after ALA-SDT with 6-hour incubation of ALA and 0.4 W/cm(2) ultrasound. After ALA-SDT, intracellular ROS level increased and mitochondrial membrane potential collapsed. Translocations of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol and Bax from cytosol into mitochondria, cleaved caspase 9, cleaved caspase 3, upregulation of CHOP, as well as downregulation of Bcl-2 after ALA-SDT were detected, which could be suppressed by NAC.

"Obesity is associated with systemic low-grade inflammation and is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the molecular mechanism remains uncertain. We noticed spleen-derived interleukin (IL)-10 because it is observed that obesity reduces several cytokines in the spleen. We examined whether spleen-derived IL-10 regulates CKD caused by a high-fat diet (HF)-induced obesity as follows: (i) male mice were fed with HF (60% fat) during 8 weeks and IL-10 induction from the spleen was examined, (ii) glomerular hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammatory responses in the kidney and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were evaluated in splenectomy (SPX)-treated mice fed HF, (iii) exogenous IL-10 was systemically administered to HF-induced obese mice and the alteration of obesity-induced pathogenesis caused by IL-10 treatment was assessed. (iv) IL-10 knockout (IL-10KO) mice were treated with SPX and glomerular hypertrophy, fibrosis and the inflammatory condition in the kidney and SBP were also investigated. Obesity decreased serum levels of only IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine even though pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in the spleen was significantly lower in the obese group. SPX aggravated HF-induced inflammatory responses in the kidney and hypertension. These HF-induced alterations were inhibited by systemically administered IL-10. Moreover, SPX had little effect on inflammatory responses and SBP in the kidney of IL-10KO mice.",Is obesity-related chronic kidney disease associated with spleen-derived IL-10?,"We suggest that obesity reduces IL-10 induction from the spleen, and spleen-derived IL-10 may protect against the development of CKD induced by obesity.",1,1.

"Detection of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of breast cancer remains an important goal. Changes in the structure of O-linked glycans occur in all breast cancers resulting in the expression of glycoproteins that are antigenically distinct. Indeed, the serum assay widely used for monitoring disease progression in breast cancer (CA15.3), detects a glycoprotein (MUC1), but elevated levels of the antigen cannot be detected in early stage patients. However, since the immune system acts to amplify the antigenic signal, antibodies can be detected in sera long before the antigen. We have exploited the change in O-glycosylation to measure autoantibody responses to cancer-associated glycoforms of MUC1 in sera from early stage breast cancer patients. We used a microarray platform of 60mer MUC1 glycopeptides, to confirm the presence of autoantibodies to cancer associated glycoforms of MUC1 in a proportion of early breast cancer patients (54/198). Five positive sera were selected for detailed definition of the reactive epitopes using on chip glycosylation technology and a panel of glycopeptides based on a single MUC1 tandem repeat carrying specific glycans at specific sites. Based on these results, larger amounts of an extended repertoire of defined MUC1 glycopeptides were synthesised, printed on microarrays, and screened with sera from a large cohort of breast cancer patients (n = 395), patients with benign breast disease (n = 108) and healthy controls (n = 99). All sera were collected in the 1970s and 1980s and complete clinical follow-up of breast cancer patients is available. The presence and level of autoantibodies was significantly higher in the sera from cancer patients compared with the controls, and a highly significant correlation with age was observed. High levels of a subset of autoantibodies to the core3MUC1 (GlcNAcβ1-3GalNAc-MUC1) and STnMUC1 (NeuAcα2,6GalNAc-MUC1) glycoforms were significantly associated with reduced incidence and increased time to metastasis.",Are autoantibodies to aberrantly glycosylated MUC1 in early stage breast cancer associated with a better prognosis?,Autoantibodies to specific cancer associated glycoforms of MUC1 are found more frequently and at higher levels in early stage breast cancer patients than in women with benign breast disease or healthy women.

"Circadian rhythm disturbances in adults with cancer are associated with fatigue, time to relapse, and death. This study of circadian activity rhythms (CAR) of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on continuation chemotherapy aimed to describe CAR before and after starting dexamethasone, and to determine whether fatigue was associated with less robust CAR. This was a secondary analysis of data from a multi-institutional study in which children with ALL aged 5-18 years wore an actigraph for 10 consecutive 24-hour periods, five before and five during dexamethasone therapy. CAR parameters measured by actigraphy were calculated for each 5-day period, including peak activity, MESOR, amplitude, acrophase, and circadian quotient. Fatigue was measured on study days 2, 5, 7, and 10 by parent-report and self-report for children ≥ 7 years. Eighty-two children qualified for CAR analysis, and 87 for analysis of daily peak activity patterns and fatigue. Mean age was 8.8 ± 3.3 years. Peak activity, MESOR, and amplitude significantly decreased during dexamethasone therapy. Children on high-dose dexamethasone (8 or 12 mg/m(2)/d) had significantly higher (better, or more robust) values of several CAR parameters than those on low-dose (6 mg/m(2)/d).

"Our aim was to elucidate mechanisms involved in the acquisition of lipid transport properties during enterocyte differentiation. We show that lipid mobilization via apolipoprotein B lipoproteins is dependent on the expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) during differentiation of Caco-2 cells into enterocyte-like cells. Mechanistic studies showed that binding of the nuclear receptor family 2 group F member 1 (NR2F1) to the DR1 element in the MTTP promoter suppresses MTTP expression in undifferentiated cells. During cellular differentiation, NR2F1 expression and its binding to MTTP promoter decline and MTP induction ensues. Moreover, undifferentiated cells express inositol-requiring enzyme 1beta (IRE1beta), a protein that posttranscriptionally degrades MTP mRNA, and its expression substantially decreases during differentiation, contributing to MTP induction.

"Low levels of adiponectin, an adipocytokine with anti-diabetic and anti-atherogenic properties, are associated with increased risk of future myocardial infarction in men. Previous studies have demonstrated that cigarette smoking is involved in the development of insulin resistance, and current smokers have been shown to have reduced plasma adiponectin levels. However, the influence of smoking cessation on adiponectin levels remains unknown. We sought to assess whether smoking cessation is associated with increased plasma adiponectin levels in men. The study includes 72 men (47 non-smokers and 25 current smokers at baseline) with stable angina pectoris who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and follow-up coronary angiography 6 months later. During the 6-month follow-up period, all 47 non-smokers remained non-smokers, while 15 men of the 25 baseline current smokers successfully quit smoking. We evaluated plasma adiponectin levels at coronary intervention and 6 months later. Plasma adiponectin levels at coronary intervention were comparable to those after 6 months in non-smokers (4.22 [3.15-6.43] vs. 4.58 [3.03-6.26] microg/mL, P=0.124) and in persistent smokers (4.77 [4.25-10.53] vs. 5.16 [4.11-8.10] microg/mL, P=0.721). Meanwhile, an increase in adiponectin level was observed in patients who quit smoking for 6 months (4.24 [3.30-5.70] vs. 5.50 [4.03-8.00] microg/mL, P=0.002). Univariate analysis revealed that the percent increase in adiponectin levels correlated positively with smoking cessation (P=0.003) and negatively with additional use of beta-blockers (P=0.049). In addition, increases in adiponectin levels were closely associated with increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.148), decrease in triglycerides (P=0.140), and additional use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (P=0.069).

"Although a cardioprotective function of target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling inhibition has been suggested by pharmacological studies using rapamycin, genetic evidences are still lacking. We explored adult zebrafish as a novel vertebrate model for dissecting signaling pathways in cardiomyopathy. We generated the second adult zebrafish cardiomyopathy model induced by doxorubicin. By genetically analyzing both the doxorubicin and our previous established anemia-induced cardiomyopathy models, we decipher the functions of TOR signaling in cardiomyopathies of different etiology. Along the progression of both cardiomyopathy models, we detected dynamic TOR activity at different stages of pathogenesis as well as distinct effects of TOR signaling inhibition. Nevertheless, cardiac enlargement in both models can be effectively attenuated by inhibition of TOR signaling through short-term rapamycin treatment. To assess the long-term effects of TOR reduction, we used a zebrafish target of rapamycin (ztor) mutant identified from an insertional mutagenesis screen. We show that TOR haploinsufficiency in the ztor heterozygous fish improved cardiac function, prevented pathological remodeling events, and ultimately reduced mortality in both adult fish models of cardiomyopathy. Mechanistically, these cardioprotective effects are conveyed by the antihypertrophy, antiapoptosis, and proautophagy function of TOR signaling inhibition.",Does haploinsufficiency of target of rapamycin attenuate cardiomyopathies in adult zebrafish?,"Our results prove adult zebrafish as a conserved novel vertebrate model for human cardiomyopathies.

"Recently, a new subfamily of long-chain toxins with a Kunitz-type fold was found in scorpion venom glands. Functionally, these toxins inhibit protease activity and block potassium channels. However, the genomic organization and three-dimensional (3-D) structure of this kind of scorpion toxin has not been reported. Here, we characterized the genomic organization and 3-D nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the scorpion Kunitz-type toxin, LmKTT-1a, which has a unique cysteine pattern. The LmKTT-1a gene contained three exons, which were interrupted by two introns located in the mature peptide region. Despite little similarity to other Kunitz-type toxins and a unique pattern of disulfide bridges, LmKTT-1a possessed a conserved Kunitz-type structural fold with one α-helix and two β-sheets. Comparison of the genomic organization, 3-D structure, and functional data of known toxins from the α-KTx, β-KTx, γ-KTx, and κ-KTx subfamily suggested that scorpion Kunitz-type potassium channel toxins might have evolved from a new ancestor that is completely different from the common ancestor of scorpion toxins with a CSα/β fold.

"Evolutionary dynamics plays a central role in facilitating the mechanisms of species divergence among pathogenic and saprophytic mycobacteria. The ability of mycobacteria to colonize hosts, to proliferate and to cause diseases has evolved due to its predisposition to various evolutionary forces acting over a period of time. Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), a taxonomically unknown 'generalist' mycobacterium, acts as an immunotherapeutic against leprosy and is approved for use as a vaccine against it. The large-scale field trials of this MIP based leprosy vaccine coupled with its demonstrated immunomodulatory and adjuvant property has led to human clinical evaluations of MIP in interventions against HIV-AIDS, psoriasis and bladder cancer. MIP, commercially available as 'Immuvac', is currently the focus of advanced phase III clinical trials for its antituberculosis efficacy. Thus a comprehensive analysis of MIP vis-à-vis evolutionary path, underpinning its immanent immunomodulating properties is of the highest desiderata. Genome wide comparisons together with molecular phylogenetic analyses by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP), enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) based genotyping and candidate orthologues sequencing revealed that MIP has been the predecessor of highly pathogenic Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex (MAIC) that did not resort to parasitic adaptation by reductional gene evolution and therefore, preferred a free living life-style. Further analysis suggested a shared aquatic phase of MAIC bacilli with the early pathogenic forms of Mycobacterium, well before the latter diverged as 'specialists'.",Does molecular analysis of a leprosy immunotherapeutic bacillus provide insights into Mycobacterium evolution?,This evolutionary paradigm possibly affirms to marshall our understanding about the acquisition and optimization of virulence in mycobacteria and determinants of boundaries therein.,1,1.

"We evaluated the predictive value of baseline plasma connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in a prospective study of patients with type 1 diabetes. Subjects were 198 type 1 diabetic patients with established diabetic nephropathy and 188 type 1 diabetic patients with persistent normoalbuminuria. Follow-up time was 12.8 years. Prediction of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality by plasma CTGF was analyzed in conjunction with conventional risk factors. Plasma CTGF was higher in patients with nephropathy than in patients with normoalbuminuria (median 381 [interquartile range 270-630] vs. 235 [168-353] pmol/l). In patients with nephropathy, elevated plasma CTGF was an independent predictor of ESRD (covariate-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.6 [95% CI 1.1-2.5]) and correlated with the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (cumulative R = 0.46). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for prediction of ESRD was 0.72. Plasma CTGF above a cutoff level of 413 pmol/l predicted ESRD with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 63% and was associated with a higher rate of decline in GFR (mean +/- SD 5.4 +/- 4.9 vs. 3.3 +/- 3.5 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per year). Moreover, in patients with nephrotic range albuminuria (>3 g/day), plasma CTGF was the only predictor of ESRD (covariate-adjusted HR 4.5 [2.0-10.4]).

"Acute renal failure can be treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or intermittent haemodialysis (IHD). Whether this choice affects renal recovery has been debated, since it has implications on quality of life and costs. Our objective was to determine the impact of CRRT and IHD on renal recovery. Nationwide retrospective cohort study between the years 1995 and 2004. Follow-up ranged between 3 months and 10 years. Thirty-two Swedish intensive care units. Eligible subjects were adults treated in Swedish general intensive care units with RRT. A total of 2,642 patients from 32 ICUs were included. We then excluded patients with end-stage renal disease (252) and patients lacking a diagnosis in the in-patient register (188). Thus, 2,202 patients were studied. Follow-up was complete. None. The primary outcome was renal recovery. Secondarily we studied the mortality of the cohort. There were no differences between IHD and CRRT patients regarding baseline characteristics, such as age, sex and comorbidities. Of the 1,102 patients surviving 90 days after inclusion in the cohort, 944 (85.7%) were treated with CRRT and 158 (14.3%) were treated with IHD. Seventy-eight patients (8.3%; confidence interval, CI, 6.6-10.2), never recovered their renal function in the CRRT group.

"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Neurofibromin, the protein product of NF1, functions as a negative regulator of Ras activity in circulating hematopoietic and vascular wall cells, which are critical for maintaining vessel wall homeostasis. NF1 patients have evidence of chronic inflammation resulting in the development of premature cardiovascular disease, including arterial aneurysms, which may manifest as sudden death. However, the molecular pathogenesis of NF1 aneurysm formation is unknown. With the use of an angiotensin II-induced aneurysm model, we demonstrate that heterozygous inactivation of Nf1 (Nf1(+/-)) enhanced aneurysm formation with myeloid cell infiltration and increased oxidative stress in the vessel wall. Using lineage-restricted transgenic mice, we show that loss of a single Nf1 allele in myeloid cells is sufficient to recapitulate the Nf1(+/-) aneurysm phenotype in vivo.

"To investigate the effects of Compound Xuanju Capsule on the levels of sex hormones and the weight of sexual organs in castrated male rats. A randomized model control trail was performed in 60 young male SD rats of SPF grade, of which 12 were included in the normal control group, and the others were castrated and randomly divided into a model control group and a high-dose, a median-dose and a low-dose Xuanju group. The control groups received intragastric administration of normal saline, and the model groups solution of Compound Xuanju Capsule, all for 20 days.

"Dengue is a major public health problem in many tropical and sub-tropical countries. Vascular leakage and shock are identified as the major causes of deaths in patients with severe dengue. Studies have suggested the potential role of Fc gamma receptors I (FcγRI) in the pathogenesis of dengue. We hypothesized that the circulating level of Fcγ receptor I could potentially be used as an indicator in assisting early diagnosis of severe dengue. A selected cohort of 66 dengue patients including 42 dengue with signs of vascular leakage, and 24 dengue without signs of vascular leakage were identified and were afterwards referred to as 'cases' and 'controls' respectively. Thirty seven normal healthy controls were also recruited in this study. The circulating level of FcγRI was quantified from the serum using enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

"Endoscopic lung volume reduction by means of endobronchial valve implantation is an established therapy in patients with severe emphysema. However, long-term complications such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are a limitation of this method. As the mechanisms underlying increased rates of COPD exacerbations are unknown, the aim of our study was to determine whether infectious or inflammatory factors may contribute to these events and to investingate the consequent need for valve explantation.

"Rice blast disease is caused by the filamentous Ascomycetous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and results in significant annual rice yield losses worldwide. Infection by this and many other fungal plant pathogens requires the development of a specialized infection cell called an appressorium. The molecular processes regulating appressorium formation are incompletely understood. We analyzed genome-wide gene expression changes during spore germination and appressorium formation on a hydrophobic surface compared to induction by cAMP. During spore germination, 2,154 (approximately 21%) genes showed differential expression, with the majority being up-regulated. During appressorium formation, 357 genes were differentially expressed in response to both stimuli. These genes, which we refer to as appressorium consensus genes, were functionally grouped into Gene Ontology categories. Overall, we found a significant decrease in expression of genes involved in protein synthesis. Conversely, expression of genes associated with protein and amino acid degradation, lipid metabolism, secondary metabolism and cellular transportation exhibited a dramatic increase. We functionally characterized several differentially regulated genes, including a subtilisin protease (SPM1) and a NAD specific glutamate dehydrogenase (Mgd1), by targeted gene disruption. These studies revealed hitherto unknown findings that protein degradation and amino acid metabolism are essential for appressorium formation and subsequent infection.",Does transcriptome analysis reveal new insight into appressorium formation and function in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae?,We present the first comprehensive genome-wide transcript profile study and functional analysis of infection structure formation by a fungal plant pathogen.

"Solitomab is a novel, bispecific, single-chain antibody that targets epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on tumor cells and also contains a cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) (T-cell coreceptor) binding region. The authors evaluated the in vitro activity of solitomab against primary chemotherapy-resistant epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines as well as malignant cells in ascites. EpCAM expression was evaluated by flow cytometry in 5 primary ovarian cancer cell lines and in 42 fresh ovarian tumor cell cultures in ascites from patients with mainly advanced or recurrent, chemotherapy-resistant disease. The potential activity of solitomab against EpCAM-positive tumor cells was evaluated by flow cytometry, proliferation, and 4-hour chromium-release, cell-mediated cytotoxicity assays. EpCAM expression was detected by flow cytometry in approximately 80% of the fresh ovarian tumors and primary ovarian tumor cell lines tested. EpCAM-positive, chemotherapy-resistant cell lines were identified as resistant to natural killer cell-mediated or T-cell-mediated killing after exposure to peripheral blood lymphocytes in 4-hour chromium-release assays (mean±standard error of the mean, 3.6%±0.7% of cells killed after incubation of EpCAM-positive cell lines with control bispecific antibody). In contrast, after incubation with solitomab, EpCAM-positive, chemotherapy-resistant cells became highly sensitive to T-cell cytotoxicity (mean±standard error of the mean, 28.2%±2.05% of cells killed; P<.0001) after exposure to peripheral blood lymphocytes.

"Choline needs are increased in pregnancy. Choline can be used as a source of methyl for homocysteine remethylation to methionine, but choline synthesis requires methyls from methionine. Vitamin B-12 deficiency increases choline use for homocysteine methylation. We investigated whether poor vitamin B-12 status occurs and contributes to low plasma choline and altered biomarkers of choline synthesis in pregnant women. With the use of a post hoc analysis, we addressed the association of maternal plasma vitamin B-12 status with postnatal growth rates in term infants. Blood was analyzed for a prospective study of 264 and 220 pregnant women at 16 and 36 wk of gestation, respectively, and 88 nonpregnant women as a reference. The proportion of women with a plasma total vitamin B-12 concentration <148 pmol/L (deficient) or 148-220 pmol/L (marginal) increased with pregnancy and pregnancy duration, which affected 3% and 9% of nonpregnant women, 10% and 21% of women at 16 wk of gestation, and 23% and 35% of women at 36 wk of gestation, respectively. Plasma free choline, betaine, and dimethylglycine were lower in women at 36 wk of gestation with a deficient or marginal compared with sufficient plasma total vitamin B-12 concentration (>220 pmol/L). Plasma total vitamin B-12 was positively associated with the increase in plasma free choline from midgestation to late gestation (P < 0.001).

"Maternal antibody is the major form of protection against disease in early life; however, its presence interferes with active immunization of offspring. In order to overcome the immunosuppression caused by maternal antibody, several immune strategies were explored in this paper using mouse model and influenza vaccines. The results showed that: i) when the offspring were immunized with the same vaccine as their mothers, whether inactivated or DNA vaccine, the presence of maternal antibody inhibited offspring immune response and the offspring could not be protected from a lethal influenza virus infection; ii) when the offspring, born to mothers immunized with inactivated vaccine, were immunized with NA DNA vaccine, the interference of maternal antibody were overcome and the offspring could survive a lethal virus challenge; iii) when the offspring were immunized with different DNA vaccine from that for their mothers, the interference of maternal antibody were also overcome.

"Effective therapeutic strategies that can achieve long-term improvement in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer are urgently needed. We recently reported that the activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway induced by docetaxel explains resistance to docetaxel in castration resistant prostate cancer. In this study we explored the efficacy of NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K and mTORC1/2 inhibitor, for docetaxel resistant castration resistant prostate cancer. We used the 2 human castration resistant prostate cancer cell lines C4-2 and C4-2AT6. At our laboratory C4-2AT6 cells were established from C4-2 under androgen ablated treatment for 6 months. We investigated the efficacy of NVP-BEZ235 monotherapy and NVP-BEZ235 combined with docetaxel in vitro and in vivo. Increased phosphorylated Akt in C4-2AT6 cells was significantly inhibited by NVP-BEZ235 in a dose and time dependent manner. WST cell proliferation assay results in C4-2AT6 cells revealed that combined administration of NVP-BEZ235 and docetaxel had significant, synergistically greater cytotoxicity than NVP-BEZ235 or docetaxel monotherapy. Combined NVP-BEZ235 (40 mg/kg) and docetaxel (4 mg/kg) in vivo in a castrated mouse xenograft model inhibited C4-2AT6 tumor growth to a greater degree than in the monotherapy groups. Also, NVP-BEZ235 showed significant efficacy with docetaxel at a low concentration in vivo, suggesting that NVP-BEZ235 effectively decreased resistance to docetaxel.",Does dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 sensitize docetaxel in castration resistant prostate cancer?,Results suggest that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by NVP-BEZ235 can overcome docetaxel resistance in human castration resistant prostate cancer.

"Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)] is a key second messenger found ubiquitously in higher eukaryotic cells. The activation of Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases and the subsequent production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) is an important cell signaling event that has been causally linked to the activation of a variety of downstream cellular processes, such as cell migration and proliferation. Although numerous proteins regulating a variety of biological pathways have been shown to bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), there are no data to demonstrate multiple mechanisms for PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) synthesis in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate an alternative pathway for the in vivo production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) mediated by the action of murine Type Ialpha phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (Type Ialpha PIPkinase), an enzyme best characterized as regulating cellular PtdIns(4,5)P(2) levels. Analysis of this novel pathway of PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) synthesis in cellular membranes leads us to conclude that in vivo, Type Ialpha PIPkinase also acts as a PtdIns(3,4)P(2) 5-kinase. We demonstrate for the first time that cells actually contain an endogenous PtdIns(3,4)P(2) 5-kinase, and that during oxidative stress, this enzyme is responsible for PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) synthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by upregulating the H(2)O(2)-induced PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) levels using overexpression studies, the endogenous PtdIns(3,4)P(2) 5-kinase is likely to be Type Ialpha PIPkinase.","Does a novel pathway of cellular phosphatidylinositol ( 3,4,5 ) -trisphosphate synthesis is regulate by oxidative stress?","We describe for the first time a novel in vivo activity for Type Ialpha PIPkinase, and a novel pathway for the in vivo synthesis of functional PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), a key lipid second messenger regulating a number of diverse cellular processes.",1,"Is there a new mechanism for the production of cellular phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate that is influenced by oxidative stress?",32.0,2075.0,2255.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.356747627258301,1.7172489166259766,6.048604249954224,"Yes, the novel pathway of cellular phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate synthesis is regulated by oxidative stress, as demonstrated by the action of Type Ialpha PIPkinase during oxidative stress conditions.",0.4
"The differences in implantable pressure sensor aneurysm sac readings were compared following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) among three different stent grafts. From January 2006 to March 2009, 51 aortic stent grafts were implanted along with the Endosure sensor. Grafts used were Zenith, Talent, and Excluder. In the present retrospective study, pulse ratios were measured intraoperatively before and after aneurysm sac exclusion and in follow-up (within 30 days). Analysis of variance was used to determine significance. The average aneurysm size that was repaired was 5.75 cm (range: 4-8.5 cm); 41 patients (80.4%) being male with an average age of 76.3 years (range: 58-90 years). Thirty-four grafts were Zenith, 9 were Talent, and 8 were Excluder.

"Neuropathic pain is caused by neural damage or dysfunction and neuropathic pain-related symptoms are resistant to conventional analgesics. Neuroinflammation due to the cytokine-chemokine network may play a pivotal role in neuropathic pain. We demonstrate that macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β) participates in neuropathic pain. Mice received partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL), and tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were assessed by von Frey test and Hargreaves test, respectively. Agents were administered into the region surrounding the sciatic nerve (SCN). Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, the mRNA expressions of MIP-1β and its receptor (CC-chemokine receptor 5; CCR5) in the injured SCN were up-regulated after PSL. MIP-1β immunoreactivity was localized in macrophages and Schwann cells and increased in the injured SCN on day 1. PSL-induced tactile allodynia on days 4 to 7 was prevented by the administration of MIP-1β neutralizing antibody (anti-MIP-1β; on days 0, 3 and 6). PSL-induced up-regulations of inflammatory cytokine-chemokine mRNAs in the injured SCN were suppressed with anti-MIP-1β treatment on day 7. Administration of CCR5 antagonist, D-ala-peptide T-amide (on days 0, 3 and 6) prevented tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia on days 4 to 14.

"The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography for the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with Levovist was performed on 62 consecutive patients (53 with pancreatic cancer, 4 with islet cell tumor, 3 with inflammatory pancreatic tumor, and 2 with metastatic tumor). The vascular and perfusion image phases of the tumors were evaluated and compared with the findings of contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography showed tumor vessels around and/or in the tumor at the vascular image phase in 79% of pancreatic cancer patients (42/53). At the perfusion image phase, 96% of pancreatic cancers (51/53) were classified as hypo-enhancement type. However, tiny spotty or irregular heterogeneous enhanced lesions were found in 84% of hypo-enhanced pancreatic cancer patients (43/51). The presence of small vessels at the vascular image phase was closely correlated with the presence of these intratumor regional enhanced lesions at the perfusion image phase (kappa coefficient=0.42).

"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease caused by motor neuron degeneration. Recently, a novel SIGMAR1 gene variant (p.E102Q) was discovered in some familial ALS patients. We address mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration caused by the mutation using Neuro2A cells overexpressing σ1R(E102Q), a protein of a SIGMAR1 gene variant (p.E102Q) and evaluate potential amelioration by ATP production via methyl pyruvate (MP) treatment. σ1R(E102Q) overexpression promoted dissociation of the protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and cytoplasmic aggregation, which in turn impaired mitochondrial ATP production and proteasome activity. Under ER stress conditions, overexpression of wild-type σ1R suppressed ER stress-induced mitochondrial injury, whereas σ1R(E102Q) overexpression aggravated mitochondrial damage and induced autophagic cell death. Moreover, σ1R(E102Q)-overexpressing cells showed aberrant extra-nuclear localization of the TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), a condition exacerbated by ER stress. Treatment of cells with the mitochondrial Ca(2+) transporter inhibitor Ru360 mimicked the effects of σ1R(E102Q) overexpression, indicating that aberrant σ1R-mediated mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport likely underlies TDP-43 extra-nuclear localization, segregation in inclusion bodies, and ubiquitination.

"Type 2 diabetes is difficult to manage in patients with a long history of disease requiring insulin therapy. Moreover, addition of most currently available oral antidiabetic agents increases the risk of hypoglycaemia.

"Cross-linking of mast cell-bound IgE releases proinflammatory mediators, cytokines, and proteolytic enzymes and is a key event in allergic inflammation. We sought to study the effect of proteases released on effector cell activation on receptor-bound IgE and their possible role in the regulation of allergic inflammation. Using molar ratios of purified recombinant tryptase and human IgE, we studied whether tryptase can cleave IgE. Similar experiments were performed with mast cell lysates in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. IgE cleavage products were detected in supernatants of allergen cross-linked, cultivated mast cells and in tissue fluids collected from patients' skin after IgE-mediated degranulation. The effects of protamine, an inhibitor of heparin-dependent proteases on IgE-mediated allergic in vivo skin inflammation in human subjects were studied. We show that beta-tryptase, a major protease released during mast cell activation, cleaves IgE.

Patients were carefully classified into stable responder (n = 12), fluctuator (n = 15), and dyskinetic (n = 23) groups. Positive Affect was improved by L-dopa in dyskinetics and to a lesser degree in fluctuators but not in stable responders. At T = 4-6 h, Positive Affect rebounded below baseline in dyskinetics only. On regression analysis, rebound worsening positively correlated with ratings of dyskinesia severity. Negative Affect improved with L-dopa in all groups and tended to remain below baseline for 6 h after L-dopa challenge. Peak effects of L-dopa on Positive Affect and Negative Affect occurred significantly earlier than effects on Purdue Pegboard test and were positively correlated with L-dopa equivalent daily dose.",Do dyskinetic patients show rebound worsening of affect after an acute L-dopa challenge?,"There is a clinical dissociation between L-dopa effects on motor function, Positive Affect and Negative Affect.

"The objective of this prospective study is to determine cognitive dysfunction after thoracic surgery. Seventy-six patients undergoing thoracic surgery with single-lung ventilation (SLV) of an expected duration of >45 min were enrolled. Monitoring consisted of standard clinical parameters and absolute oximetry (S(ct)O(2)). The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) test was used to assess cognitive function before operation and at 3 and 24 h after operation. Data were analysed using Spearman correlation test; risks for cognitive dysfunction were expressed as odds ratios. P<0.05 and data are presented as median (interquartile range). One patient was excluded from the study. S(ct)O(2) during SLV decreased to critical values of <65%, 60%, and 55% in 40 (53%), 15 (20%), and 5 patients (7%), respectively. Twenty-two patients (29%) had a decrease of MMSE>2 points 3 h after surgery, eight patients (10%) had a decrease of MMSE>2 points 24 h after surgery.

"Cross-sectional. To determine the association between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and adherence to Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide (CFG) in community-dwelling adults with chronic Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). Ontario, Canada. Participants were recruited as part of the Study of Health and Activity in People with SCI (SHAPE-SCI). Dietary data were collected using 24-h recalls and analysed for adherence to CFG recommendations by age group and gender. LTPA was assessed using the Physical Activity Recall Assessment for Persons with SCI. Statistical analysis comprised correlations, multiple regression and χ(2). We studied 75 adults (n=61 M; 42.4±11.8 years; 25.5±5.2 kg m(-2)) with chronic (≥1-year post-injury) SCI. Of these, 37% of participants were inactive, 29% were low-active and 33% were high-active. Fewer than 5% of participants were 100% adherent with CFG; 85% were adherent to ≤50%. Activity level and overall adherence to CFG were not correlated (r=-0.052, P=0.666). Although there were no associations between LTPA and vegetables and fruit, grain products, milk and alternatives, or other foods (all P>0.05), high activity was associated with consuming less than the minimum number of recommended servings of meat and alternatives (φ=-0.258, P=0.026).",Are leisure-time physical activity and diet quality associated in people with chronic spinal cord injury?,"Clinicians need to be aware of the poor diet quality, and low levels of physical activity, of people with chronic SCI.

"To investigate the effect of lupeol, a pentacyclictriterpene, on the radiosensitivity of a human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro and in vivo xenografts. SMMC-7721 cells were exposed to γ-radiation with or without lupeol and assayed for proliferation, clonogenic survival, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. The cells were also analyzed by Western blotting for the expression levels of the proteins involved in apoptosis. Finally radiosensitization by lupeol was assessed in HCC xenograft model. Lupeol further suppressed the proliferation and colonogenic survival of the SMMC-7721 cells exposed to γ-radiation. It could also induce the accumulation of cells in G2/M phase together with γ-radiation. The data also indicated that lupeol sensitized SMMC-7721 cells exposed to γ-radiation to apoptosis and activated the apoptotic proteins including caspase-9 and PARP. Administration of lupeol with radiation in HCC xenograft model produced a significant tumor growth delay compared with radiation or lupeol alone and was well tolerated.",Does lupeol enhance radiosensitivity of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721 in vitro and in vivo?,Lupeol significantly enhanced the radiosensitivity of SMMC-7721 cells in vitro and in vivo.

"In prostate cancer-bearing host, regulatory T (Treg) cells restrain activity of tumor antigen-specific T cells. Because B7:CD28 interactions are needed for both function of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells and CD8+ effective T cells, targeting this pathway may help to overcome the immunotherapy barriers. The anti-B7-1/B7-2 monoclonal antibodies were administered to a transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer (TRAMP) ectopically expressing SV40 large T antigen in different tumor development stages for prevention and therapy of prostate cancer. The treatment was also tested in treating transplanted MC38 colon adenocarcinoma in mice. Here, we showed that short-term administration of anti-B7-1/B7-2 monoclonal antibodies in TRAMP mice leads to significant inhibited primary tumor growth and the size of metastatic lesions. The treatment is effective to inhibit MC38 colon cancer growth. Correspondingly, this treatment results in a transient reduction of Treg in both thymus and the periphery.

"The transcription factor T-bet mediates IFN-gamma production by T(H)1 cells and suppresses T(H)2 cytokine production when ectopically expressed in polarized murine T(H)2 cells. Thus T-bet-mediated inhibition of T(H)2 cytokine production might be beneficial for the treatment of allergic diseases like asthma or atopic dermatitis. We sought to investigate the effects of ectopic T-bet expression in highly polarized human T(H)2 cells obtained from skin biopsy specimens of patients with atopic dermatitis. The cytokine production of T(H)2 cells retrovirally transfected with a vector expressing human T-bet was determined by means of intracellular FACS staining and ELISA. The effects of T-bet transfection were analyzed at the mRNA level by means of real-time PCR and DNA microarrays and confirmed by using functional chemokine response assays. Transfection of T-bet into T(H)2 cells induced high levels of IFN-gamma and suppressed IL-5, but IL-2 and IL-4 production remained unchanged. T-bet transfection also induced IL-12Rbeta2 and CXCR3 expression on human T(H)2 cells, whereas the IL-18 receptor was only induced as a consequence of T-bet-mediated increased responsiveness to IL-12. Furthermore, sustained T-bet expression in human T(H)2 cells induced IL-2 production and decreased the secretion of IL-4. In addition, the chemokine receptor repertoire of these cells was changed toward a T(H)1-like profile.",Does sustained T-bet expression confer polarized human TH2 cells with TH1-like cytokine production and migratory capacities?,The combined switch in cytokine pattern and migratory potential of highly polarized human T(H)2 cells mediated by T-bet might provide an additional advantage for the treatment of allergic diseases.,1,1.

"To examine the mechanisms underlying oxidised LDL- (oxLDL)-induced alterations in Ca(2+) currents, an effect which underlies altered vascular contractility and cardiac myocyte function. Ca(2+) currents (I(Ca)) were recorded by whole-cell patch-clamp in HEK293 cells expressing L-type Ca(2+) channel alpha(1C) subunits or isolated rat ventricular myocytes. oxLDL (but not native LDL) significantly enhanced recombinant I(Ca), an effect mimicked by 1 microM lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). LPC failed to enhance I(Ca) either in mitochondrial electron transport chain-depleted rho(0) cells, or in the presence of rotenone (1 microM), or MPP(+) (10 microM). The LPC response was similarly ablated by ascorbate (200 microM) or TROLOX (500 microM) and by the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ (250 nM). In myocytes, enhancement of I(Ca) due to LPC was similarly abrogated with rotenone and MitoQ.

"Obesity is associated with altered atrial electrophysiology and a prominent risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Body mass index, the most widely used adiposity measure, has been related to atrial electrical remodeling. We tested the hypothesis that pericardial fat is independently associated with electrocardiographic measures of atrial conduction. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 1946 Framingham Heart Study participants (45% women) to determine the relation between pericardial fat and atrial conduction as measured by P wave indices (PWI): PR interval, P wave duration (P-duration), P wave amplitude (P-amplitude), P wave area (P-area), and P wave terminal force (P-terminal). We performed sex-stratified linear regression analyses adjusted for relevant clinical variables and ectopic fat depots. Each 1-SD increase in pericardial fat was significantly associated with PR interval (β=1.7 ms, P=0.049), P-duration (β=2.3 ms, P<0.001), and P-terminal (β=297 μV·ms, P<0.001) among women; and P-duration (β=1.2 ms, P=0.002), P-amplitude (β=-2.5 μV, P<0. 001), and P-terminal (β=160 μV·ms, P=0.002) among men. Among both sexes, pericardial fat was significantly associated with P-duration in analyses additionally adjusting for visceral fat or intrathoracic fat; a similar but non-significant trend existed with P-terminal.

"Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) elicits a fetal inflammatory response such as funisitis and chorionic vasculitis. However, little is known about the changes of fetal skin during MIAC. Toll-like receptors recognize microbial products and initiate an immune response. The aims of this study were to examine histopathological features of fetal skin exposed to MIAC and to assess the changes in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4 expression. Skin samples were obtained from fetal autopsies (n = 12). The cases were classified according to the presence (n = 8) or absence (n = 4) of acute chorioamnionitis and analysed by immunohistochemistry using a panel of antibodies. Leucocytic infiltrates into the superficial dermis were observed in cases with chorioamnionitis; the majority of inflammatory cells were neutrophils, lymphocytes and histiocytes. TLR-2 immunoreactivity in the skin was stronger in fetuses with chorioamnionitis than in those without this condition.

"Tumor supressor gene FHIT was identified at chromosome 3p14.2 spanning the FRA3B fragile site and is very often inactivated in different types of cancer. The aim of this study was to examine the frequency of FHIT gene LOH as well as FHIT mRNA and protein expression in sporadic colon adenocarcinoma. The results of LOH, real-time qRT-PCR and imunohistochemical analyses were correlated with clinico-pathological characteristics of patients and their tumors in order to evaluate the role of FHIT gene/protein in sporadic colon adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis. One hundred and thirty one (96.3%) samples were informative for both markers and 33/131 (25.2%) demonstrated LOH. Expression of FHIT mRNA was significantly decreased in colon tumors relative to that in corresponding normal tissue (p = 7.2×10(-6)). Most of the samples (54.0%) were negative for FHIT protein, 26.4% adenocarcinomas showed a weak to moderate immunostaining and 19.6% adenocarcinomas showed strong FHIT immunostaining. No correlation was found between FHIT gene LOH status, mRNA expression or FHIT protein immunostaining and clinico-pathological characteristics.

"Lithium, an effective psychotropic agent, affects membrane phospholipid metabolism, interferes with phosphoinositide signal transduction, and antagonizes the biological activity of calcium, all major factors of protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Consequently, lithium may interfere with cellular functions requiring PKC. Supporting this hypothesis, lithium was found to inhibit increased neurotransmitter release upon PKC activation and to prevent phorbol ester-mediated PKC translocation. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the frontal cortex of rats treated with lithium exhibits altered PKC activity and translocation in response to phorbol ester, K+, or serotonin (5-HT) receptor stimulation and to determine whether specific PKC isozymes are disproportionately affected. Rats were fed either a normal diet or one enriched with LiCl. In cerebrocortical slices or synaptosomes, cytosolic and membranous PKC activity and translocation in response to stimuli were determined after partial purification with anion exchange chromatography. In brain slices, lithium treatment inhibited phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA)-, 5-HT-, or K+-induced PKC translocation from cytosol to membrane without affecting basal membrane or cytosolic PKC activity. In synaptosomes, lithium also attenuated PMA- or K+-evoked translocation of PKC. Immunoblotting with isozyme-specific PKC antibodies revealed that chronic lithium treatment reduced basal cytosolic alphaPKC and deltaPKC but increased membrane-associated zetaPKC immunoreactivities. Stimulation with PMA, 5-HT or K+ elicited translocation of alpha, beta and gammaPKC isozymes and PMA induced translocation of delta and epsilonPKC isozymes. Stimulus-mediated translocation of PKC isozymes was attenuated in cortical tissue obtained from animals that received lithium for 6 weeks. In synaptosomes, PMA- or K+-induced PKC translocation was attenuated by in vitro lithium or chronic lithium treatment. Neither rubidium nor cesium affected PKC activities or PMA-induced translocation.

"To assess whether maternal HPA 1a alloimmunization is associated with birthweight. A retrospective observational cohort study. The national reference laboratory for clinical platelet immunology at a university hospital. 165 HPA 1a incompatible pregnancies identified from a recent screening study of 100 448 women (124 pregnancies) and the national reference laboratory for clinical platelet immunology (41 pregnancies). A linear mixed model analysis was used to assess whether maternal anti-HPA 1a antibodies were associated with birthweight. A generalized linear model was used to assess maternal anti-HPA 1a antibodies as risk factor for small-for-gestational age neonates. Both models were adjusted for gestational age at time of delivery, maternal age, parity, smoking habits during pregnancy, preeclampsia, diabetes mellitus and fetal sex. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Maternal anti-HPA 1a antibody as risk factor of reduced birthweight and small-for-gestational age neonates. The level of maternal anti-HPA 1a antibodies was significantly associated with birthweight and risk of small-for-gestational age neonates after correcting for confounding variables (p<0.001). However, this association was only significant for boys.

"Gene expression microarrays have provided many insights into changes in gene expression patterns between different tissue types, developmental stages, and disease states. Analyses of these data focused primarily measuring the relative abundance of transcripts of a gene, while treating most or all transcript isoforms as equivalent. Differences in the selection between transcript isoforms can, however, represent critical changes to either the protein product or the posttranscriptional regulation of the transcript. Novel analyses on existing microarray data provide fresh insights and new interpretations into transcriptome-wide changes in expression. A probe-level analysis of existing gene expression arrays revealed differences in mRNA processing, primarily affecting the 3'-untranslated region. Working with the example of microarrays drawn from a transcriptionally silent period of mouse oocyte development, probe-level analysis (implemented here as rmodel) identified genes whose transcript isoforms have differing stabilities. Comparison of micorarrays measuring cDNA generated from oligo-dT and random primers revealed further differences in the polyadenylation status of some transcripts.

"Resistance of cancer stem/progenitor cells (CSPCs) to chemotherapy can lead to cancer relapse. Ovarian teratocarcinoma (OVTC) arises from germ cells and comprises pluripotent cells that can be used to study cancer cell stemness. In this study, we evaluated whether microRNA-21 (miR-21) promotes ovarian teratocarcinoma by maintaining cancer stem/progenitor populations. The lentiviral delivery system was used to upregulate or to suppress the expression of miR-21 in the human ovarian teratocarcinoma cell line PA1 and cell growth assays were used to monitor the expression of miR-21 at different time points. Antibodies directed toward CD133, a stem cell marker, were used to identify CSPCs in the PA1 cell population, and the level of miR-21 expression was determined in enriched CSPCs. Stem cell functional assays (sphere assay and assays for CD133 expression) were used to assess the effects of miR-21 on progression of the CD133+ population. Knockdown of miR-21 in PA1 cells attenuated growth of PA1 cells whereas overexpression of miR-21 promoted cell growth. Moreover, knockdown of miR-21 resulted in a marked reduction in the CD133+ population and sphere formation of CSPCs. In contrast, overexpression of miR-21 resulted in a marked increase in the population of CD133+ cells as well as sphere formation of CSPCs.",Does microRNA-21 promote the ovarian teratocarcinoma PA1 cell line by sustaining cancer stem/progenitor populations in vitro?,MicroRNA-21 plays a significant role in cancer growth by regulating stemness in cancer cells.,1,1.

"Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) prevents adherence of pathogens at mucosal surfaces to prevent invasive infection. Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is located on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells and binds dimeric immunoglobulin A (IgA) produced by plasma cells in the lamina propria. This IgA-pIgR complex is transported apically, where IgA is exocytosed as SIgA to the mucosal surface. Our prior work shows that mice fed intragastric (IG, an elemental diet model) and IV parenteral nutrition (PN) solution have reduced intestinal T and B cells, SIgA, and interleukin-4 (IL-4) compared with mice fed chow or a complex enteral diet (CED). Prior work also demonstrates a reduction in IgA transport to mucosal surfaces in IV PN-fed mice. Because IL-4 up-regulates pIgR production, this work studies the effects of these diets on intestinal pIgR. Male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were randomized to chow (n = 11) with IV catheter, CED (n = 10) or IG PN (n = 11) via gastrostomy and IV PN (n = 12) for 5 days. CED and PN were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. Small intestine was harvested for pIgR and IL-4 assays after mucosal washing for IgA.

"Bordetella pertussis is a gram-negative bacterium that infects the human respiratory tract and causes pertussis or whooping cough. The disease has resurged in many countries including Finland where the whole-cell pertussis vaccine has been used for more than 50 years. Antigenic divergence has been observed between vaccine strains and clinical isolates in Finland. To better understand genome evolution in B. pertussis circulating in the immunized population, we developed an oligonucleotide-based microarray for comparative genomic analysis of Finnish strains isolated during the period of 50 years. The microarray consisted of 3,582 oligonucleotides (70-mer) and covered 94% of 3,816 ORFs of Tohama I, the strain of which the genome has been sequenced. Twenty isolates from 1953 to 2004 were studied together with two Finnish vaccine strains and two international reference strains. The isolates were selected according to their characteristics, e.g. the year and place of isolation and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles. Genomic DNA of the tested strains, along with reference DNA of Tohama I strain, was labelled and hybridized. The absence of genes as established with microarrays, was confirmed by PCR. Compared with the Tohama I strain, Finnish isolates lost 7 (8.6 kb) to 49 (55.3 kb) genes, clustered in one to four distinct loci. The number of lost genes increased with time, and one third of lost genes had functions related to inorganic ion transport and metabolism, or energy production and conversion.

"The objective was to evaluate the utility of a screen with reflex-to-fractionation testing compared with direct-to-fractionation testing for suspected toxic exposure. This study was based on a retrospective data analysis of urine arsenic results from previously tested samples (n=12,960). Total urine arsenic by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used as a screening method to identify elevated arsenic concentrations. Arsenic fractionation was the speciation assay to differentiate toxic and benign arsenic species. Screening samples based on total arsenic concentration resulted in less than 10% of samples requiring arsenic fractionation, with a final positivity rate of less than 1% for toxic arsenic. Samples with fractionation ordered directly had a positivity rate for toxic arsenic of 3.3%.

"Previous studies have demonstrated elevation of systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines after treadmill exercise in patients with intermittent claudication (IC), but it is unknown if growth factor expression also is stimulated. The aim of this study was to assess whether physical exercise-induced ischemia elicits an inflammatory response and increase in local and systemic vascular growth factor expression in patients with IC. Nineteen patients with IC had plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, hs-CRP) and vascular growth factors (VEGF and FGF-2) measured before and at four time points after a treadmill exercise test. In 10 patients a gastrocnemius muscle biopsy was obtained to measure VEGF and FGF-2 mRNA. Plasma concentrations of vWF were also measured. Five patients who underwent the treadmill test without experiencing calf pain were enrolled as controls. Plasma concentrations of IL-6 increased after exercise (p=0.004), while TNF-alpha and hs-CRP were unchanged (p=0.191 and p=0.709, respectively). Plasma concentrations of VEGF were similar (p=0.151) at the different time points after exercise but FGF-2 levels decreased (p=0.013).

"Accumulating evidence reveals that statins possess direct anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion in addition to their antioxidant effects, which may contribute to amelioration of ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study tested the hypothesis that perioperative treatment of simvastatin suppresses the cardiac isograft ischemia-reperfusion injury by down-regulation of CC chemokine receptor-2 expression in an inbred rat model of cardiac transplantation. Donor hearts from Lewis rats were heterotopically transplanted to Lewis rat recipients. Recipients were orally treated with simvastatin (1 mg/kg) or vehicle every morning 3 days before the surgery until the harvest day. Rats were killed at 6 hours and at 1, 3, and 7 days after transplantation. Injury was assessed by infarct size measurement, histologic and immunohistochemical examination, and intragraft myeloperoxidase activity assay. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels in serum and graft were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and intragraft CC chemokine receptor-2 expression was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The infarct size and macrophage infiltration were all significantly reduced in the simvastatin-treated group compared with those of the control group at 1 day after transplantation. Neutrophil accumulation was significantly suppressed until 3 days after transplantation, whereas myeloperoxidase activity had been significantly diminished at 1 day after transplantation.

"To examine biobehavioral responses to an acute pain event in a Cape Town, South Africa, cohort consisting of 28 Cape Colored (mixed ancestry) newborns (n = 14) heavily exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (exposed), and born to abstainers (n = 14) or light (< or = 0.5 oz absolute alcohol/d) drinkers (controls). Mothers were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. Newborn data were collected on postpartum day 3 in the maternity obstetrical unit where the infant had been delivered. Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure was defined as maternal consumption of at least 14 drinks/wk or at least 1 incident of binge drinking/mo. Acute stress-related biobehavioral markers [salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), spectral measures of heart rate variability (HRV), and videotaped facial actions] were collected thrice during a heel lance blood collection (baseline, lance, and recovery). After a feeding and nap, newborns were administered an abbreviated Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. There were no between-group differences in maternal age, marital status, parity, gravidity, depression, anxiety, pregnancy smoking, maternal education, or infant gestational age at birth (all ps > 0.15). In both groups, HR increased with the heel lance and decreased during the postlance period. The alcohol-exposed group had lower mean HR than controls throughout, and showed no change in RSA over time.

"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is associated with suppressed autophagy and augmented apoptosis in the heart although the interplay between the two remains elusive. The ability of mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 to regulate both autophagy and apoptosis prompted us to investigate it as a possible candidate in the progression of DCM. Wild-type, Mst1 (also known as Stk4) transgenic and Mst1-knockout mice were challenged with streptozotocin to induce experimental diabetes. In addition, cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were subjected to simulated diabetes to probe mechanisms. Mst1 knockout alleviated while Mst1 overexpression aggravated cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. Diabetic Mst1 transgenic mice exhibited decreased LC3 expression and enhanced protein aggregation. In contrast, typical autophagosomes were observed in diabetic Mst1-knockout mice with increased LC3 expression and reduced protein aggregation. Mst1 downregulation promoted autophagic flux as demonstrated by increased LC3-II and decreased p62 expression in the presence of bafilomycin A1. Furthermore, Mst1 overexpression increased, while Mst1 knockout decreased, cardiomyocyte apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Mst1 overexpression promoted Beclin1 binding to B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and induced dissociation of Bcl-2 from Bax in diabetic mice.

"This study was undertaken to elucidate the potential mechanism of the antitumor activity of ET-18-O-CH(3), a synthetic analogue of lysophosphatidyl choline, and a known antitumor agent and specific inhibitor of phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI-PLC). A normal rat liver epithelial ""oval"" cell line (WB-F344) was neoplastically transformed by the H-ras oncogene (WB-ras2) and treated with a series of ET-18-O-CH(3) concentrates for a number of days. Cell growth, morphological ""differentiation"", cell cycle regulation, karyotypic changes, growth in soft agar (anchorage-independent growth) and the expression of cdk2, cdc2 and ERK genes were studied to determine the effect of ET-18-O-CH(3) on these neoplastic cells.

"O-GlcNAcylation occurs via an O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) moiety linked to the side chain hydroxyl of a serine or threonine residue on nucleocytoplasmic proteins. This reaction, which is catalyzed by O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT), is involved in a variety of human cancers; however, its clinical significance in gastric carcinomas (GC) has been poorly investigated in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining for O-GlcNAcylation and OGT was performed in 64 primary GCs, 40 gastric adenomas and nonneoplastic tissues adjacent to GCs, including 31 tissues of intestinal metaplasia and 24 normal gastric tissues. Their expressions were also studied in 20 tissues of chronic gastritis according to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. O-GlcNAcylation was expressed in the nucleus and both the nuclear rim and cytoplasm. OGT was strongly expressed in the nucleus and weakly expressed in the cytoplasm. O-GlcNAcylation expression levels were significantly correlated with those of OGT. Their expression levels were progressively increased during the carcinogenesis of GC. O-GlcNAcylation expression was higher in GC with intestinal type, higher pT stage and nodal metastasis, while OGT expression was higher in GC with nodal metastasis. Nuclear O-GlcNAcylation expression was more frequently observed in tumors including GC and adenoma than in nonneoplastic tissues including intestinal metaplasia and normal tissue.

"Driving is an important part of everyday life for the elderly today. Older drivers are suspected to be involved in more automobile accidents than younger adults. Although healthcare professionals are aware of specific diseases and impairments that increase accident risks, they cannot distinguish safe from unsafe drivers among the healthy elderly population in general practice. Previous English studies of younger populations differentiate three main types of bad driving that are associated with accident involvement: violations, errors, and lapses. The aim of this study was to assess the driving behavior associated with car crashes in a healthy elderly population. This prospective survey of healthy drivers aged 65 years or older living in the community asked subjects about their habitual driving and accident history in the past three years. Subjects also completed the French version of the Manchester Aging Driver Questionnaire, which contains 24 items, scored from 0 (never) to 5 (nearly all the time) and yields three sub-scales: errors, violations, and lapses. Simple logistic regression, adjusted for age and sex, was used to analyze associations between the questionnaire results and driving history. These elderly drivers (mean age: 69 years) reported primarily lapses (mean: 5.42) but also violations (mean: 3.76) and errors (mean: 2.12). In all, 237 drivers (27%) reported accidents: 29.4% of the men compared with 20.2% of the women (p<0.01).

"The prognostic factors for patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis (L-Mets) have not been fully described. Resected specimens were obtained surgically from 1998 to 2008 at our university hospital. We investigated whether the status of two primary lesion cancer stem biomarkers, CD44 and CD133, were maintained in L-Mets and whether these markers were L-Mets prognostic factors. To investigate the CD133 and CD44 status, proliferation, invasiveness, and chemoresistance were examined immunohistochemically by using MIB-1, E-cadherin, and ABC-G2. The CD44-positive rate in primary lesions and L-Mets was 41.4 and 58.7 %, respectively. There was no correlation of CD44 expression between primary lesions and L-Mets (r = 0.250, p = 0.071).

"Elevated urine albumin excretion is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Increased cardiovascular risk may be partly mediated by abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism. We examined cross-sectional associations of urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) with standard lipid measurements and with lipoprotein particle concentrations measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Among 5633 participants who were not using lipid-lowering medications, greater ACR was associated with greater triglyceride concentration and lesser high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (women only), but not with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol calculated using conventional methods. In contrast, unadjusted mean small LDL particle concentrations measured by NMR were 770, 827 and 935 nmol/L for women (p<0.001) and 996, 1030 and 1040 nmol/L for men (p=0.037) among participants with normal, high normal and elevated ACR. Adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, hypertension, smoking, medications, body mass index and serum creatinine, each two-fold greater ACR was associated with an increase in small LDL particle concentration of 27 nmol/L for women (p<0.001) and 14 nmol/L for men (p=0.008).

"This study examined the influence of lower extremity body composition and muscle strength on the severity of mobility-disability in community-dwelling older adults. Fifty-seven older males and females (age 74.2 +/- 7 yrs; BMI 28.9 +/- 6 kg/m2) underwent an objective assessment of lower extremity functional performance, the Short Physical Performance Battery test (SPPB). Participants were subsequently classified as having moderate (SPPB score 7: n = 38) or severe mobility impairments (SPPB score <or= 7: n = 19). Body composition was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and provided measures of bone mineral density (BMD), total leg lean mass (TLM) and total body fat. Maximal hip extensor muscle strength was estimated using the bilateral leg press exercise. Multiple logistic regression analysis was utilized to identify the significant independent variables that predicted the level of mobility-disability. TLM was a strong independent predictor of the level of functional impairment, after accounting for chronic medical conditions, BMD, body fat, body weight and habitual physical activity. In a separate predictive model, reduced muscle strength was also a significant predictor of severe functional impairment. The severity of mobility-disability was not influenced by gender (p = 0.71).

"Early detection of individuals with Type 2 diabetes mellitus or hypertension at risk for micro- or macroalbuminuria may facilitate prevention and treatment of renal disease. We aimed to discover plasma and urine metabolites that predict the development of micro- or macroalbuminuria. Patients with Type 2 diabetes (n = 90) and hypertension (n = 150) were selected from the community-cohort 'Prevention of REnal and Vascular End-stage Disease' (PREVEND) and the Steno Diabetes Center for this case-control study. Cases transitioned in albuminuria stage (from normo- to microalbuminuria or micro- to macroalbuminuria). Controls, matched for age, gender, and baseline albuminuria stage, remained in normo- or microalbuminuria stage during follow-up. Median follow-up was 2.9 years. Metabolomics were performed on plasma and urine. The predictive performance of a metabolite for albuminuria transition was assessed by the integrated discrimination index. In patients with Type 2 diabetes with normoalbuminuria, no metabolites discriminated cases from controls. In patients with Type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria, plasma histidine was lower (fold change = 0.87, P = 0.02) and butenoylcarnitine was higher (fold change = 1.17, P = 0.007) in cases vs. controls.

"Serum leptin levels are strongly and directly related to fat body mass (FBM). Bone mineral density (BMD) increases with FBM, and obesity has a protective effect against osteoporosis. We have previously demonstrated that leptin therapy has a significant effect in preventing ovariectomy-induced bone loss in rats and leptin also exerts direct osteogenic effects in vitro. To obtain a better understanding of the physiology and pharmacology of leptin in bone metabolism, we evaluated the leptin-induced signal transduction pathways and proliferative response in the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2. Saos-2 cell lines were used. Leptin receptor common form (OB-Ra) and long form (OB-Rb) were detected by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. PI(3)-K activity was immunoprecipitated using antibodies directed against tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and IRS-1. The activated form of p42/p44 MAPK was investigated in cytosolic extracts of confluent Saos-2 in response to leptin.

"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most prevalent human pathogens, and consist of 101 serotypes that are classified into groups A and B according to sequence variations. HRV infections cause a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe lower respiratory symptoms. Defining the role of specific strains in various HRV illnesses has been difficult because traditional serology, which requires viral culture and neutralization tests using 101 serotype-specific antisera, is insensitive and laborious. To directly type HRVs in nasal secretions of infants with frequent respiratory illnesses, we developed a sensitive molecular typing assay based on phylogenetic comparisons of a 260-bp variable sequence in the 5' noncoding region with homologous sequences of the 101 known serotypes. Nasal samples from 26 infants were first tested with a multiplex PCR assay for respiratory viruses, and HRV was the most common virus found (108 of 181 samples).

"We investigated the hypothesis that an antioxidant, Vitamin C, could attenuate abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development in a rat model. An AAA model induced by intraluminal infusion was created in 36 male Sprague Dawley rats, which were randomly distributed into three groups: Sham (saline infused, placebo treated), Control (elastase infused, placebo treated), and Vitamin C (elastase infused, vitamin C treated). Vitamin C and placebo were intraperitoneally injected, initiating 1 wk before the infusion and continuing throughout the study. The aortic dilatation ratio was measured, and aortic tissues were further examined using biochemical and histologic techniques. Vitamin C attenuated the development of AAA, decreasing maximal aortic diameter by 25.8% (P < 0.05) and preserving elastin lamellae (P < 0.05). Vitamin C also decreased 8-hydroxyguanine (a marker of oxidative damage to DNA) and 8-isoprostane content (a marker of oxidative stress) in aortic tissues (P < 0.05, respectively). The proteins of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and interleukin 6 were markedly downregulated (P < 0.05, respectively), accompanied with notably reduced messenger RNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, MMP-2/9, and interleukin 1β (P < 0.05, respectively). However, messenger RNA of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-2 were both significantly upregulated in Vitamin C group.

"Coal fly ash (CFA) was used as a raw material for the synthesis of zeolite molecular sieve. The synthesis began with the pretreatment of CFA to remove impurities (e.g., Fe2O3, CaO, etc.) under various acid types (HCl, H2SO4, and HNO3) and acid/CFA ratios (5-25 mL(acid)/g(CFA)). High product purity (up to 97%) was achieved with HCl (20%wt), and acid/CFA ratio of 20 mL(HCl)/g(CFA). The treated CFA was then converted to zeolite by the fusion reaction under various Si/Al molar ratios (0.54-1.84). Zeolite type A was synthesized when the Si/Al molar ratios were lower than 1, whereas sodium aluminum silicate hydrate was formed when the Si/Al molar ratio were higher than 1. The highest water adsorption performance of the zeolite product, i.e., the outlet ethanol concentration of 99.9%wt and the specific adsorption capacity of 2.31 x 10(-2) g(water)/g(zeolite), was observed with the Si/Al molar ratio of 0.82.

"Environmental conditions or chemical agents can interfere with the function of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the resulting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can be toxic to the cell if it is not relieved. The classical compensatory response to ER stress is the unfolded protein response (UPR) that reduces protein load in the ER. However, autophagy may also compensate by removing large insoluble protein aggregates. Agents that stress the ER can have anti-cancer activity, and novel applications of ER stress inducing agents are being investigated. Plant stilbenes are a class of stress responsive molecules that includes resveratrol, which are being investigated as potential therapeutics in humans for conditions such as aging or cancer. We performed a screen of 1726 small, drug like molecules to identify those that could activate an ER-stress responsive luciferase gene. After secondary screening, we determined that the plant stilbenes pterostilbene and piceatannol were the most potent inducers of ER stress from this group. ER stress can be particularly toxic to cells with high ER load, so we examined their effect on cells expressing the Wnt family of secreted glycoprotein growth factors. Molecular analysis determined that these ER stress-inducing stilbenes could block Wnt processing and also induce autophagy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells expressing Wnt16. Combining pterostilbene (to induce ER stress) with chloroquine (to inhibit autophagy) lead to significant cellular toxicity in cells from aggressive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",Do plant stilbenes induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and their anti-cancer activity can be enhanced by inhibitors of autophagy?,"Plant stilbenes are potent inducers of ER stress.

"It has been suggested that reendothelialization of damaged blood vessels protects against the vascular injury response. The goal of the present study was to determine whether estrogen restores endothelial cell function in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Ten-week-old male and female Sprague-Dawley rats with intact gonads underwent balloon injury to the right common carotid artery. Female rats were randomized to receive either daily subcutaneous injections of 17beta-estradiol (17betaE[2]; 20 microg x kg[-1] x d[-1]) or vehicle over the course of the study. Vessel morphology was assessed 2 weeks after injury. Significant neointima formation was observed in vehicle-treated males. This response was blunted in vehicle-treated and 17beta-E(2)-supplemented females. Intima-to-media ratios were 1.28+/-0.23 (males), 0.72+/-0.07 (vehicle-treated females), and 0.49+/-0.07 (17beta-E[2]supplemented females). To test whether reductions in neointimal lesion formation were related to the functional reendothelialization of the damaged vessel, endothelium-dependent relaxation was tested in isolated ring segments from the three experimental groups. Vessels were precontracted with phenylephrine followed by cumulative administration of acetylcholine, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator. Maximum relaxation to acetylcholine was 8.13+/-1.70% (males), 22.06+/-4.36% (vehicle-treated females), and 46.47+/-3.48% (17beta-E[2]-supplemented females). The enhanced endothelium-dependent relaxation of rings from 17betaE(2)-supplemented females correlated with reduced neointimal proliferation in this group. The concentration of nitric oxide metabolites in plasma correlated positively with plasma 17beta-E(2) concentration.",Does estrogen restore endothelial cell function in an experimental model of vascular injury?,"These results suggest that estrogen protects against neointimal injury in the balloon-injured rat, at least in part, by facilitating the reendothelialization of the damaged vessel.",1,1.

"Excessive secretion of glucagon partially contributes to the development of diabetic hyperglycaemia. However, complete blocking of glucagon action will lead to adverse effects, since glucagon exerts certain beneficial effects via its receptor in many organs. We aimed to study the effects of a 'decoy receptor' for circulating glucagon on modulating beta cell function and glucose homeostasis in mice by over-producing the glucagon receptor (GCGR) in skeletal muscles. We generated transgenic mice in which the expression of Gcgr is driven by the muscle specific creatine kinase (Mck) promoter, and assessed the effects of glucagon on the modulation of glucose homeostasis under conditions of extremes of glucose influx or efflux. Mck/Gcgr mice showed increased circulating levels of glucagon and insulin, resulting in an unchanged ratio of glucagon-to-insulin. The levels of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (F1,6P2ase) were significantly decreased, whereas the phosphorylation level of pancreatic cAMP-response-element-binding-protein (CREB) was significantly increased in these transgenic mice. Under basal conditions, the mice displayed normal blood glucose levels and unchanged glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity when compared with their age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates. However, following multiple low-dose streptozotocin injections, Mck/Gcgr mice exhibited a delay in the onset of hyperglycaemia compared with the WT controls. This was associated with preserved beta cell mass and beta cell secretory capacity in response to glucose challenge.",Does ectopic expression of glucagon receptor in skeletal muscles improve glucose homeostasis in a mouse model of diabetes?,"We suggest that mild and chronic hyperglucagonaemia, through a strategy involving neutralising peripheral glucagon action, provides beneficial effects on beta cell function and glucose homeostasis.

"Obesity is associated with a mild chronic inflammatory response, which has been suggested to be pivotal in the development of cardiometabolic alterations of obesity. However, little is known about the involvement of acute inflammation. To evaluate whether circulating neutrophils, markers of acute inflammation, are associated (quantitatively and qualitatively) with adolescent obesity and whether leptin modulates these associations. We assessed 528 adolescents (16.8 yr old, 47% females), without chronic/acute illness. We measured anthropometry and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and calculated fat mass percentage (FM%). Fasting serum glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides were used with blood pressure and waist circumference to compute a metabolic z-score. Leukocyte and neutrophil counts were obtained, together with levels of serum leptin. In a subsample of 23 males, flow cytometry was used to assess degranulation (CD66b expression) of neutrophils. Female sex and obesity were positively related to mean neutrophil counts (p < 0.05). When accounting for sex and weight status, leptin was associated with neutrophil counts (p < 0.05), partially explaining the association between obesity and neutrophil counts. Neutrophil counts were related to metabolic risk z-scores, controlling for fat mass. Participants with elevated FM% showed more neutrophil degranulation than controls (p < 0.05).",Is obesity associated with acute inflammation in a sample of adolescents?,"Participants with increased adiposity had higher circulating neutrophil counts, suggesting acute inflammation.

"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is secreted by intestinal I cells and regulates important metabolic functions. In pancreatic islets, CCK controls beta cell functions primarily through CCK1 receptors, but the signalling pathways downstream of these receptors in pancreatic beta cells are not well defined. Apoptosis in pancreatic beta cell apoptosis was evaluated using Hoechst-33342 staining, TUNEL assays and Annexin-V-FITC/PI staining. Insulin secretion and second messenger production were monitored using ELISAs. Protein and phospho-protein levels were determined by Western blotting. A glucose tolerance test was carried out to examine the functions of CCK-8s in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. The sulfated carboxy-terminal octapeptide CCK26-33 amide (CCK-8s) activated CCK1 receptors and induced accumulation of both IP3 and cAMP. Whereas Gq -PLC-IP3 signalling was required for the CCK-8s-induced insulin secretion under low-glucose conditions, Gs -PKA/Epac signalling contributed more strongly to the CCK-8s-mediated insulin secretion in high-glucose conditions. CCK-8s also promoted formation of the CCK1 receptor/β-arrestin-1 complex in pancreatic beta cells. Using β-arrestin-1 knockout mice, we demonstrated that β-arrestin-1 is a key mediator of both CCK-8s-mediated insulin secretion and of its the protective effect against apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells. The anti-apoptotic effects of β-arrestin-1 occurred through cytoplasmic late-phase ERK activation, which activates the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase-phospho-Bcl-2-family protein pathway.",Does different downstream signalling of CCK1 receptors regulate distinct functions of CCK in pancreatic beta cells?,Knowledge of different CCK1 receptor-activated downstream signalling pathways in the regulation of distinct functions of pancreatic beta cells could be used to identify biased CCK1 receptor ligands for the development of new anti-diabetic drugs.,1,1.

"Two consortium-based genome-wide association studies have recently identified robust and significant associations of common variants with systolic and diastolic blood pressures in populations of European descent, warranting further investigation in populations of non-European descent. We examined the associations at 27 loci reported by the genome-wide association studies on Europeans in a screening panel of Japanese subjects (n=1526) and chose 11 loci showing association signals (1-tailed test in the screening, P<0.3) for an extensive replication study with a follow-up panel of 3 Japanese general-population cohorts (n < or =24 300). Significant associations were replicated for 7 loci-CASZ1, MTHFR, ITGA9, FGF5, CYP17A1-CNNM2, ATP2B1, and CSK-ULK3-with any or all of these 3 traits: systolic blood pressure (P=1.4x10(-14) to 0.05), diastolic blood pressure (P=1.9x10(-12) to 0.05), and hypertension (P=2.0x10(-14) to 0.006; odds ratio, 1.10 to 1.29). The strongest association was observed for FGF5. In the whole study panel, the variance (R(2)) for blood pressure explained by the 7 single-nucleotide polymorphism loci was calculated to be R(2)=0.003 for male and 0.006 for female participants.

"Before guidelines were issued, many patients with hepatitis B flare and hepatic decompensation had discontinued lamivudine therapy instead of indefinite therapy. We investigated their outcomes. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 263 consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis B (94 with cirrhosis) who recovered from a flare of hepatitis with hepatic decompensation and were followed after cessation of lamivudine therapy. Clinical events that occurred during the follow-up period were assessed by chart review and analysis of results from retrospective assays. The mean duration of lamivudine therapy was 12.1 ± 8.6 months; data were collected from patients for 89.1 ± 38.7 months after therapy ended. In the first year off therapy, 29.9% of patients had clinical relapse, 16.2% had hepatitis flares, and 8.2% had hepatic decompensation. There was no significant difference in the incidence of hepatic decompensation between patients with and without cirrhosis.

"In ∼10% of newly diagnosed HIV-1 patients, drug-resistant viral variants are detected. In such transmitted HIV-1 variants, the thymidine analogue mutation (TAM) M41L is frequently observed as a single resistance mutation and these viral variants often belong to phylogenetic transmission clusters. The presence of at least three TAMs, in particular patterns with M41L/L210W, impairs the efficacy of the extensively used drug tenofovir. We investigated whether the presence of a single M41L mutation at baseline influences the selection of resistance to tenofovir and emtricitabine in vitro and in vivo. The impact of M41L on the development of drug resistance to tenofovir and emtricitabine was determined by extensive in vitro selection experiments and investigation of the virological outcome of patients on a first-line regimen. The presence of a single M41L mutation did not influence the selected mutational profile or the genetic barrier to resistance to tenofovir and/or emtricitabine during long-term in vitro selection experiments.

"Ketamine toxicity has been demonstrated in nonhuman mammalian neurons. To study the toxic effect of ketamine on human neurons, an experimental model of cultured neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) was examined, and the mechanism of its toxicity was investigated. Human iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons were treated with 0, 20, 100 or 500 μM ketamine for 6 and 24 h. Ketamine toxicity was evaluated by quantification of caspase 3/7 activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP concentration, neurotransmitter reuptake activity and NADH/NAD+ ratio. Mitochondrial morphological change was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. Twenty-four-hour exposure of iPSC-derived neurons to 500 μM ketamine resulted in a 40% increase in caspase 3/7 activity (P < 0.01), 14% increase in ROS production (P < 0.01), and 81% reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (P < 0.01), compared with untreated cells.

"Gemcitabine is a key drug for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) is a major transporter responsible for gemcitabine uptake into cells. This study was conducted to elucidate the association between expression level of hENT1 and outcome for pancreatic cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy including gemcitabine. Sixty-three patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by curative surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas were included. Immunohistochemistry was performed using resected specimens and the staining intensity of hENT1 was scored as having no staining, low staining, or high staining; the former two were defined as negative expression of hENT1. The association between expression level of hENT1 and overall survival was evaluated by Cox proportional regression model. Expression level of hENT1 was evaluated as positive in 22 (35%) patients, and as negative in 41 (65%) patients.

"Vasoactive agents and inotropes influence conduit-coronary blood flow following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). It was hypothesized that dopexamine hydrochloride, a dopamine A-1 (DA-1) and beta(2) agonist would increase conduit-coronary blood flow. A prospective randomized double blind clinical trial was carried out to test this hypothesis. DA-1 receptors have previously been localized to human left ventricle. Twenty-six American Society of Anaesthesiology class 2-3 elective coronary artery bypass graft patients who did not require inotropic support on separation from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were studied. According to a randomized allocation patients received either dopexamine (1 microg/kg per min) or placebo (saline) by intravenous infusion for 15 min. Immediately prior to and at 5,10 and 15 min of infusion, blood flow through the internal mammary and vein grafts (Transit time flow probes, Transonic Ltd.), heart rate, cardiac index, mean arterial pressure and pulmonary haemodynamics were noted. The data were analysed using multivariate analysis of variance. Low-dose dopexamine (1 microg/kg per min) caused a significant increase in mammary graft blood flow compared to placebo at 15 min of infusion (P=0.028, dopexamine group left internal mammary artery (LIMA) flow of 43.3+/-14.2 ml/min, placebo group LIMA flow at 26.1+/-16.3 ml/min). Dopexamine recipients demonstrated a non-significant trend to increased saphenous vein graft flow (P=0.059). Increased heart rate was the only haemodynamic change induced by dopexamine (P=0.004, dopexamine group at 85.2+/-9.6 beats/min and placebo group at 71.1+/-7.6 beats/min after 15 min of infusion).",Does dopexamine increase internal mammary artery blood flow following coronary artery bypass grafting?,This study demonstrates that administration of dopexamine (1 microg/kg per min) was associated with a significant increase in internal mammary artery graft blood flow with mild increase in heart rate being the only haemodynamic change.

"The influence of liver fibrosis on the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after ablation therapy has not been fully elucidated. We previously reported that P2/MS [(platelet count [10(9)/L])2/(monocyte fraction[%] x segmented neutrophil fraction[%])] is an effective and noninvasive marker reflecting the degree of hepatic fibrosis. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between P2/MS value and hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after radiofrequency ablation therapy in this study. Chronic hepatitis B patients who underwent RFA for hypervascular single hepatocellular carcinoma at Seoul National University Hospital between 2004 and 2007 were prospectively included. We identified the predictors of recurrence using Cox-regression model. Fifty one patients were included. Median follow-up duration was 14.2 months. Twenty patients experienced tumor recurrence.

"Coronary artery disease is the significant cause of morbidity and mortality today. The treatment of coronary artery disease is improving, but its prevalence is increasing. Both primary and secondary prevention measures are of vital importance. In this study, vitamin C, total antioxidant status, malondialdehyde in serum and erythrocyte-reduced glutathione levels were investigated in patients with atherosclerosis and compared with those of controls. Levels of serum MDA, vitamin C, total antioxidant status, and erythrocyte-reduced glutathione were determined according to the methods of Yagi, Bauer et al., Miller et al., and Beutler, respectively.

"Physiological liver regeneration requires adequate microvascular perfusion after partial hepatectomy. Although Kupffer cells (KCs) are known to play a key role in modulating hepatocyte proliferation, their impact on regulating hepatic microcirculation during liver regeneration has so far been disregarded. With respect to their expression and modulation of vasoactive mediators, KCs may provide important signals that regulate hepatic perfusion during liver regeneration. Intravital fluorescence microscopy, immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and RT-PCR were used to analyze livers of KC-depleted mice (liposome-encapsulated clodronate application) and KC-competent mice at days 3, 5, and 8 after 68% hepatectomy. Selective and long-lasting KC elimination limited the resection-associated hyperperfusion, as evidenced by an only 1.7- to 2-fold increase of sinusoidal volumetric blood flow and shear stress in contrast to a 3.5- to 5-fold increase in KC-competent mice. In accordance to that livers of KC-depleted mice showed an altered pattern of vasoregulatory gene expression. KC-depleted mice failed to show resection-induced increase of HO-1 and eNOS protein expression, but revealed a reduction of hepatic eNOS and HO-1 protein levels to 22 and 12% of the corresponding values in KC-competent mice. In addition, the eNOS inhibitory protein caveolin-1 was increased in KC-depleted animals prior to as well as after resection. Furthermore, resection-associated accumulation of ET-1 mRNA was absent in KC-depleted livers. Finally, liver mass restoration was impaired, with a regain of only 79% weight within 8 days after resection in KC-depleted mice.",Are kupffer cells mandatory for adequate liver regeneration by mediating hyperperfusion via modulation of vasoactive proteins?,"The present study documents a remarkable change of the vasoactive mediator profile upon KC-depletion and liver resection, limiting intrahepatic hyperperfusion.

"The cell type(s) mediating the maternal influence on allergic disease in children remain unclear. We set out to define the relationship between maternal allergy and frequencies of cord blood (CB) basophils, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs); to characterize surface-bound IgE and FcεRI expressions on these cells; and to investigate the association between maternal and CB serum IgE levels with surface-bound IgE and FcεRI expressions. One hundred and three mother/infant dyads were recruited prenatally, and maternal allergic history was recorded. Maternal blood was collected prior to delivery, and CB was collected after birth. Flow cytometry was used to identify CB basophils and pDCs and to determine surface-bound IgE and FcεRI expressions. Frequencies of CB basophils and pDCs were low and not related to maternal history of allergy. Percentages of CB basophils with surface-bound IgE were significantly higher in infants of allergic mothers compared with infants of non-allergic mothers (median, 59.60% vs. 19.70%, p = 0.01). IgE on CB basophils correlated with CB IgE levels (r = 0.72, p < 0.0001), but not with maternal IgE levels (r = 0.26, p = 0.06).

"Endogenous glucocorticoids (GCs) modulate numerous biologic systems involved in the initiation and maintenance of arthritis. Bone cells play a critical role in the progression of arthritis, and some of the effects of GCs on inflammation may be mediated via these cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of osteoblast-targeted disruption of GC signaling on joint inflammation, cartilage damage, and bone metabolism in the K/BxN mouse serum transfer model of autoimmune arthritis. Intracellular GC signaling was disrupted in osteoblasts through transgenic overexpression of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 under the control of a type I collagen promoter. Arthritis was induced in 5-week-old male transgenic mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates, and paw swelling was assessed daily until the mice were killed. The mice were examined by histology, histomorphometry, and microfocal computed tomography, and serum was analyzed for cytokines, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and corticosterone. Acute arthritis developed in both transgenic and WT mice treated with K/BxN mouse serum. However, the arthritis and local inflammatory activity were significantly attenuated in transgenic mice, as judged by clinical and histologic indices of inflammation and cartilage damage. Bone turnover and bone volume remained unchanged in arthritic transgenic mice, while WT mice exhibited stimulated bone resorption, suppressed osteoblast activity, and significantly reduced bone volume, compatible with the known effects of active inflammation on bone. Circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines tended to be lower in arthritic transgenic mice than in control transgenic mice.",Does transgenic disruption of glucocorticoid signaling in mature osteoblasts and osteocytes attenuate K/BxN mouse serum-induced arthritis in vivo?,Disruption of GC signaling in osteoblasts significantly attenuates K/BxN mouse serum-induced autoimmune arthritis in mice.

"We have previously reported that prealbumin and albumin may be sensitive indicators of the risk of recurrent disease in colorectal cancer; however, the relationship between preoperative prealbumin and cancer survival has not been fully-elucidated. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between preoperative nutritional conditions, including prealbumin and albumin concentrations, and the risk of recurrence in cases with breast cancer. One hundred and fifty-seven patients who underwent breast surgery were analyzed in this study. The detection limit of the prealbumin assay was 22 mg/dl; patients were divided in analytical groups of <22 mg/dl and ≥22 mg/dl. The detection limit of the albumin assay was 4.0 g/dl; patients were divided in analytical groups of <4.0 g/dl and ≥4.0 g/dl. The clinical features of these cases were reviewed according to prealbumin and albumin levels, and statistical analysis was performed. Among 157 cases in this study, five (3.2%) had disease recurrence. Out of the eligible cases, 38 (24.2%) had decreased serum prealbumin and 19 (12.1%) had decreased serum albumin preoperatively. No statistically significant association of the preoperative prealbumin level was found with the clinicopathological variables. The only statistically significant association found for preoperative albumin level was age; age was higher in patients with low albumin levels.

"This study tested the hypothesis that the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) regulates adhesion molecule expression, reduces inflammatory cell migration and infiltration into the Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected cornea of susceptible B6 mice, and promotes corneal healing and resistance. B6 mice received daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections of VIP from -1 through 5 days after infection. Control mice were similarly injected with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Transcript levels of adhesion molecules were determined by PCR array, then select molecules were tested individually by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and confirmed at the protein level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescent staining with confocal laser scanning microscopy at various time points after infection to assess the effects of VIP treatment in the regulation of adhesion molecule expression. Injection of B6 mice with VIP compared with PBS resulted in significant downregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, and P-selectin and L-selectin mRNA expression. Protein levels for ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, detected by ELISA, supported the mRNA data at similar time points.

"This study was conducted to evaluate the role of high serum lipoprotein(a) levels in a group of patients with a relatively early onset of cerebral infarction as a whole and in a subgroup with the perforating artery occlusion subtype of cerebral infarction. Fifty-four patients with cerebral infarction, the onset of which was before age 65 years (37 men, 17 women; mean age, 61.9 +/- 7.7 years) were examined in this study. When patients with atrial fibrillation were excluded to omit cardiac embolic strokes from analysis, the group consisted of 45 patients. The patients were classified into two subtype groups, the perforating artery occlusion group and the cortical artery occlusion group, by using magnetic resonance imaging. Lipoprotein(a) levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Four biochemical variables (serum levels of lipoprotein(a), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) and other potential risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking habits, alcohol intake, and family history were analyzed by stepwise logistic regression to determine the independent and significant risk factors for cerebral infarction without atrial fibrillation. The incidence of subjects with serum lipoprotein(a) levels > or = 42.6 mg/dL, which is the 95th percentile level of the control subjects, was significantly increased in the total cerebral infarction group (P < .025) and the perforating artery occlusion group (P < .025) compared with the control group. In addition, by using stepwise logistic regression analysis in the total and perforating artery occlusion patient groups we identified three independent and significant risk factors: hypertension, a low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and a high serum lipoprotein(a) level. In the cortical artery occlusion group, the sample size was not large enough for the statistical analysis.

"Elevated serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA increases the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Rather than instantaneous DNA level, the duration of persistent HBV replication is more important in carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, most investigators evaluated the DNA level at study entry. We assessed the effects of persistently detectable serum HBV DNA on HCC recurrence. We included 230 consecutive patients undergoing curative resection between 2000 and 2006. Patients who had antiviral therapy (at diagnosis or during follow-up), fluctuating DNA (cut-off value: 100,000 copies/ml) or recurrence within 12 months of resection were excluded. Ultimately, 157 were enrolled: 89 (non-viraemia group) had consistently negative DNA (<100,000 copies/ml), while 68 (viraemia group) had consistently positive DNA (>100 000copies/ml). Serum DNA level, biochemical tests, alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) and liver dynamic computed tomography were obtained every 3 months after surgery. There were no significant differences in age, gender, liver function, histology, AFP, tumour stages or follow-up duration between the two groups. During follow-up (median: 35 months), patients in the non-viraemia group had a lower 5-year cumulative recurrence rate (54.7%) than those in the viraemia group (72.9%; P=0.043). In multivariate analysis, sustained viraemia (P=0.041) increased recurrence independently.",Does persistent hepatitis B viral replication affect recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after curative resection?,"Persistent viraemia increased recurrence independently after surgery.

"The aim of this study was to assess the effects of protein restriction in growing rats. Rats (approximate weight, 100g) were maintained with low-protein (LP; 6%) or normoproteic (control; 17%) diets, and at the end of the 15th day, hormonal and biochemistry parameters and energetic balance were evaluated. Data were analyzed using Student's t test (with statistical significance set at P < or = .05). LP animals were hyperphagic and showed increased energetic gain (24%) and energy expenditure (EE) compared with controls. The increase in EE was followed by increased sympathetic activity in brown adipose tissue, evidenced by increased norepinephrine turnover, suggesting increased thermogenesis. In spite of hyperphagia, protein ingestion in LP animals was lower than that of controls (P<0.01). The LP diet impaired body growth and caused deep alterations in body chemical composition, with an increase in carcass lipid content (64%) and reductions of protein and water. In LP animals, postprandial glycemia was unchanged, and insulinemia was lower than in controls (P < or = .01). Reduction in fasting glycemia without changes in insulinemia also was detected (P < .01), suggesting increased insulin sensitivity. The LP diet caused a 100% increase in serum leptin (P < .01).",Does low protein diet change the energetic balance and sympathetic activity in brown adipose tissue of growing rats?,"Protein restriction led to an increase in EE, with probable activation of thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, evidenced by an increase in catecholamines levels.

"Pacemaker lead implantation can cause thrombosis, which can be associated with serious local morbidity and complicated by pulmonary embolism. Few reliable estimates of the incidence of thrombosis have been reported. The contribution of established risk factors to venous thrombosis in patients with implanted pacemaker leads is unknown. One hundred forty-five consecutive patients n = 145) underwent routine clinical and Doppler ultrasound evaluation for thrombosis before and 3, 6, and 12 months after lead implantation. Established risk factors for venous thrombosis were assessed in detail for all patients. Clinical outcome, including clinically manifest thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, associated pacemaker lead infection, complicated reinterventions, and death, was evaluated. Thrombosis was observed in 34 (23%) of 145 patients. Thrombosis did not cause any signs or symptoms in 31 patients but resulted in overt clinical symptoms in 3 patients. The absence of anticoagulant therapy, use of hormone therapy, and a personal history of venous thrombosis were associated with an increased risk of thrombosis.

"Management of asymptomatic unruptured intracranial aneurysms remains controversial, and recent prospective follow-up studies showed that the rupture rate of small aneurysms is very low. These results are inconsistent with the finding that the majority of ruptured aneurysms in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage are small. A Markov model was constructed to simulate the natural history of intracranial aneurysms. All epidemiological and statistical data obtained from the Portal Site of Official Statistics of Japan (e-Stat) were adjusted to the standardized age distribution. From the selected data of aneurysm formation, the prevalence of unruptured aneurysms was estimated as 1.45% and the incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage calculated to be 19.7/100 000/year in the whole standardized population. The function for rupture rate constant with time was first analyzed. Selected values for annual rupture rates of 0.3%, 0.5%, 0.7%, and 1.0% showed inconsistencies in the relationship between the prevalence of unruptured aneurysm and the incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Next, the function for a short period of high risk followed by a long period of low risk was considered. Annual rupture rates of 0.5%, 0.7%, and 1.0% indicated epidemiological compatibility with additional early rupture rates of 20%, 15%, and 10%, respectively.",Is risk profile of intracranial aneurysms : rupture rate constant after formation?,"This study suggests that some aneurysms bleed shortly after formation and thus are rarely detected as unruptured aneurysms.

"Detachment of endothelial cells may represent serious injury of the endothelium after cardiopulmonary bypass. We investigated whether the extent of endothelial injury is related to the type of cardiopulmonary bypass system used (conventional or minimized) and determined circulating endothelial cells as well as von Willebrand factor and soluble thrombomodulin. Twenty patients scheduled for elective coronary bypass grafting were randomly assigned to either the minimal extracorporeal circulation system or the standard cardiopulmonary bypass. Ten healthy volunteers served as controls. Circulating endothelial cells per milliliter of full blood were perioperatively determined by immunomagnetic cell separation technique. Endothelial plasma markers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Preoperative circulating endothelial cell numbers did not differ between the experimental groups, but were significantly higher than in the healthy controls (18.6 +/- 5.6 vs 7.2 +/- 3.8, P < .001). At 6 hours, circulating endothelial cell numbers increased significantly compared with baseline in both experimental groups and peaked at 12 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass initiation, each time with significantly lower values in the minimal extracorporeal circulation group (6 hours: 44.0 +/- 9.9 vs 29.6 +/- 9.8, P = .007; 12 hours: 48.1 +/- 6.8 vs 31.8 +/- 7.1, P < .001). Likewise, von Willebrand factor and soluble thrombomodulin postoperatively increased in both groups with a tendency toward lower levels in the minimal extracorporeal circulation group. Although circulating endothelial cells gradually declined, continually with lower numbers in the minimal extracorporeal circulation group, the endothelial plasma markers remained elevated during observation time.",Do circulating endothelial cells demonstrate an attenuation of endothelial damage by minimizing the extracorporeal circulation?,Circulating endothelial cells represent a novel marker of the intrinsic endothelial damage caused by cardiopulmonary bypass.

"Hypothermia is a frequent manifestation after trauma-induced hemorrhagic shock. Clinical studies have suggested that hypothermia is an independent risk variable predisposing patients to an increase in morbidity. Thus, most of the current goal-directed resuscitation protocols are aimed at the establishment of euthermia. However, recent data suggest that hypothermia may provide protection by attenuating the inflammatory response after hemorrhagic shock. The purpose of this study was twofold: to examine the effects of mild to moderate hypothermia on barrier function after hemorrhagic shock, and to determine the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this process. After a control period, blood was withdrawn to reduce the mean arterial pressure to 40 mm Hg for 1 hour in urethane-anesthetized rats. Mesenteric postcapillary venules in a transilluminated segment of small intestine were examined to quantitate changes in permeability and ROS expression. Sprague-Dawley rats received an intravenous injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-albumin during the control period. The fluorescent light intensity emitted from the FITC-albumin was recorded with digital microscopy within the lumen of the microvasculature and compared with the intensity of light in the extravascular space. The images were downloaded to a computerized image analysis program that quantitates changes in light intensity. This change in light intensity represents albumin-FITC extravasation. Our results demonstrated a marked increase in albumin leakage after hemorrhagic shock that was significantly attenuated with mild (34 degrees C) and moderate (30 degrees C) hypothermia. In addition, hypothermia attenuated ROS expression after hemorrhagic shock.",Does hypothermia reduce microvascular permeability and reactive oxygen species expression after hemorrhagic shock?,These data suggest that hypothermia may protect barrier integrity after hemorrhagic shock by inhibition of oxygen radical expression.,1,1.

"In both humans and rodents, males have lower levels of leptin than females at any level of adiposity. Experimental data support the idea that testosterone exerts a negative influence on leptin levels. There are, however, major inconsistencies in available data concerning the possible association between androgenicity and leptin in humans. Reasons could be the influence of androgenicity on leptin production being dependent on body composition, and incomplete measures of biologically active testosterone levels. In the present study we have characterized the relationship between biologically active testosterone and leptin after careful stratification for gender and adiposity. Healthy subjects (n=158; 85 men and 73 pre- and postmenopausal women) from the Northern Sweden MONICA (Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease) population were studied with a cross-sectional design. Anthropometric measurements (body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference) and oral glucose tolerance tests were performed. Circulating levels of leptin, insulin, testosterone, androstenedione, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were measured by radioimmunoassays or microparticle enzyme immunoassays. Apparent concentrations of free testosterone and non-SHBG-bound testosterone were calculated. After adjustments for age, BMI and insulin, leptin levels were inversely correlated to testosterone levels in non-obese men (r=-0.56, P<0.01) and obese women (r=-0.48, P<0.05). In contrast, leptin and testosterone correlated in a positive manner in non-obese women (r=0.59, P<0.01). Levels of SHBG were negatively associated with leptin in men with low waist circumference (r=-0.59, P<0.01). The following factors were associated with leptin in a multivariate model: low levels of biologically active testosterone and SHBG in men with low and medium waist circumference, insulin in men with high waist circumference, high levels of testosterone and insulin in non-obese women, and BMI in obese women.",Is a strong association between biologically active testosterone and leptin in non-obese men and women lost with increasing ( central ) adiposity?,"We conclude that low leptin levels are associated with androgenicity in non-obese men and women and that the direction of this association is dependent on gender and body fat distribution.

"The study explored the hypothesis that spontaneous nystagmus (Ny) in migraine patients can be triggered or modulated by painful trigeminal stimulation, providing evidence of a functional connection between vestibular and trigeminal systems. Vertigo attacks are reported by subjects with migraine or a familiar history of migraine, also independently of headache episodes. Idiopathic vertigo is three times more frequent in migraine patients than in controls. Vestibular investigations in migraine patients have consistently demonstrated spontaneous Ny both of central and peripheral origin. In the first phase of the study 10 outpatients experiencing migraine without aura (MO) and 10 healthy volunteers were submitted to the registration of spontaneous primary-position Ny in the dark by Ulmer's video-ocular-nystagmographic equipment. Two electrodes for electrical stimulation were applied on the supraorbital point of one side of the head and the intensity of stimulation corresponding to pain threshold was calculated. Spontaneous ocular movements were recorded for 5 minutes at baseline and after a sequence of five electric pulses (square waves of .5 Hz frequency and 50 micros duration, at pain threshold intensity). Nystagmographic responses were expressed as latency after stimulation, direction of the quick phase, and duration. The second phase of the study explored, with the same procedure, the effects on Ny of supraorbital versus median nerve stimulation in other 10 MO patients. Responses to stimulation were considered the appearance of de novo Ny after stimulation in subjects without baseline Ny, or the change of the frequency (at last a 50% variation) or of the direction of Ny after stimulation in subjects with baseline Ny. The latency and the duration of responses to stimulation were also calculated. In the first series supraorbital painful electric stimulation was able to modify or to evoke Ny in 8 of 10 migraineurs and in none of 10 volunteers (Fisher's exact test, P<.01). Both the baseline and the induced Ny were second degree, stationary persistent, with a linear slow phase and were suppressed by visual fixation. In the second series, supraorbital nerve stimulation was able to induce or modify Ny in all of 10 patients but only in 1 patient Ny was induced by median nerve stimulation. Characters of Ny were the same as previously described. Statistical comparison of the responses at the two sites of stimulation was significant (Fisher's exact test, P<.01). In those 7 patients who presented de novo Ny after stimulation it was possible to calculate Ny latency and duration. The mean latency was 25 s (SD: 16, range: 14 to 60). The mean duration was 120 s (SD: 94, range: 20 to 290).",Does trigeminal stimulation elicit a peripheral vestibular imbalance in migraine patients?,"The main result of our study is that in migraine patients painful trigeminal stimulation elicits de novo, or modifies pre-existing spontaneous Ny, generally increasing it.

"To characterize the circadian clock in murine cartilage tissue and identify tissue-specific clock target genes, and to investigate whether the circadian clock changes during aging or during cartilage degeneration using an experimental mouse model of osteoarthritis (OA). Cartilage explants were obtained from aged and young adult mice after transduction with the circadian clock fusion protein reporter PER2::luc, and real-time bioluminescence recordings were used to characterize the properties of the clock. Time-series microarrays were performed on mouse cartilage tissue to identify genes expressed in a circadian manner. Rhythmic genes were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using mouse tissue, primary chondrocytes, and a human chondrocyte cell line. Experimental OA was induced in mice by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM), and articular cartilage samples were microdissected and subjected to microarray analysis. Mouse cartilage tissue and a human chondrocyte cell line were found to contain intrinsic molecular circadian clocks. The cartilage clock could be reset by temperature signals, while the circadian period was temperature compensated. PER2::luc bioluminescence demonstrated that circadian oscillations were significantly lower in amplitude in cartilage from aged mice. Time-series microarray analyses of the mouse tissue identified the first circadian transcriptome in cartilage, revealing that 615 genes (∼3.9% of the expressed genes) displayed a circadian pattern of expression. This included genes involved in cartilage homeostasis and survival, as well as genes with potential importance in the pathogenesis of OA.

"A collaborative care (CC) intervention for patients with panic disorder that provided increased patient education and integrated a psychiatrist into primary care was associated with improved symptomatic and functional outcomes. This report evaluates the incremental cost-effectiveness and potential cost offset of a CC treatment program for primary care patients with panic disorder from the perspective of the payer. We randomly assigned 115 primary care patients with panic disorder to a CC intervention that included systematic patient education and approximately 2 visits with an on-site consulting psychiatrist, compared with usual primary care. Telephone assessments of clinical outcomes were performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Use of health care services and costs were assessed using administrative data from the primary care clinics and self-report data. Patients receiving CC experienced a mean of 74.2 more anxiety-free days during the 12-month intervention (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.8-122.0). The incremental mental health cost of the CC intervention was $205 (95% CI, -$135 to $501), with the additional mental health costs of the intervention explained by expenditures for antidepressant medication and outpatient mental health visits. Total outpatient cost was $325 (95% CI, -$1460 to $448) less for the CC than for the usual care group.

"The pathogenesis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)-induced small intestinal lesions remains unclear, although it is considered to be quite different from that of upper gastrointestinal tract ulcers due to the absence of acid and the presence of bacteria and bile in the small intestine. The aim of this study was to characterize specific gene expression profiles of intestinal mucosa in indomethacin-induced small intestinal injury, and to investigate the effects of rebamipide on the expression of these genes. Intestinal injury was induced in male Wistar rats by subcutaneous administration of indomethacin. Total RNA of the intestinal mucosa was extracted 24 h after indomethacin administration, gene expression was investigated using microarray analysis, and the identified genes were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, we investigated whether the treatment with rebamipide altered the expression of these identified genes. The administration of indomethacin induced small intestine injuries, and these lesions were significantly inhibited by the treatment with rebamipide. Microarray analysis showed that the genes for several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and several chemokine-related genes were significantly upregulated, and metallothionein 1a (MT1a) was downregulated in the intestinal mucosa after administration of indomethacin.

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients with pelvic fractures between January 2005 and November 2009. We focused on stable pelvic fracture patients with contrast extravasation on CT who then received angioembolization. The demographics, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Scale score, and the blood glucose levels on admission were analyzed. In total, 334 patients were enrolled. Patients with higher blood glucose level on admission with stable pelvic fracture had a higher rate of angioembolization. Furthermore, these patients presented with a higher Abbreviated Injury Scale score and ISS.",Is higher glucose on admission associated with need for angioembolization in stable pelvic fracture?,"In patients with stable pelvic fracture, higher blood glucose level on admission was associated with a higher likelihood of needing angioembolization.

"The Thomsen-Friedenreich blood group antigen (galactose beta 1,3-N-acetyl galactosamine alpha-) acts as an oncofetal antigen in the colonic epithelium, with low expression in normal adult epithelia but increasing to fetal levels of expression in hyperplasia or malignancy. Peanut lectin is one of the commonest dietary lectins that binds this antigen. The aim of this study was to determine whether peanut ingestion can alter rectal epithelial proliferation. Thirty-six patients with normal colonic mucosa consumed 100 g of peanuts each day for 5 days. Rectal mitotic index was measured before and after ingestion, and changes in proliferation were correlated with immunohistochemical detection of lectin receptor expression by colonocytes and fecal lectin activity as measured by hemagglutination assay. Peanut ingestion caused a 41% increase in rectal mucosal proliferation in individuals with macroscopically normal mucosa who express TF antigen in their rectal mucosae (10 of 36 patients studied). The proliferative response correlated with fecal hemagglutinating activity, and peanut lectin could be shown immunohistochemically within the rectal mucosa.",Does peanut ingestion increase rectal proliferation in individuals with mucosal expression of peanut lectin receptor?,"The common expression of galactose beta 1,3-N-acetyl galactosamine alpha- by hyperplastic and neoplastic epithelia may therefore be functionally important because it allows interaction with mitogenic dietary lectins.

"To elucidate whether miR-216b suppresses cell proliferation and invasion by targeting PKCα, thus to reveal the molecular mechanism that miR-216b functions as a tumor suppressor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). PKCα 3'UTR-luciferase vector was constructed and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was employed to examine the effect of miR-216b on luciferase activity. Nasopharyngeal cancer CNE2 cells were transfected with miR-216b mimics, and then qRT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect the expressions of PKCa mRNA and protein. The effects of PKCα downregulation on cell proliferation and invasion were assessed after PKCα siRNA were transfected into CNE2 cells. CNE2 cells were cotransfected with miR-216b mimics and PKCα plasmid, and the proliferation of CNE2 cells was assayed using a MTS cell proliferation assay kit. The results of dual-luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that miR-216b could bind to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of PKCα and inhibited the luciferase activity to 62.4% of that of the mimics control cells. The expressions of PKCα mRNA and protein were significantly down-regulated by 49.1% and 55.7%, respectively, in comparison with that of the control cells. siRNA-mediated downregulation of PKCα suppressed the proliferation and invasion ability of CNE2 cells, and could partially mimic the tumor-inhibiting effect of miR-216b.

"Minimally invasive colon surgery (MIS) has been shown to minimize pain and decrease overall recovery time. No studies have shown a clear oncologic benefit. Some literature suggests that the time to administration of chemotherapy can be important to improve outcomes for advanced colon cancer. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of minimally invasive surgery on the timing of chemotherapy administration. This was a retrospective review of all patients undergoing surgery for colon cancer at a tertiary institution between 2004 and 2013. A total of 668 partial colectomies for cancer were performed; 241 were stage III and above and deemed appropriate for chemotherapy. Eighty-five patients did not receive chemotherapy (patient's wishes, age/comorbidities or lost to follow-up). Of the 156 patients who received chemotherapy, 57 underwent MIS and 99 had open colectomy. Average time to chemotherapy after MIS colectomy was 42.9 versus 60.3 days for open surgery (p < 0.001). In the open group, 52 (53 %) people had postoperative complications and readmissions versus 24 (39 %) in the MIS group. Postoperative complications increased the time to chemotherapy for all patients.

"BACKGROUND & AIMS Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. The majority of patients treated with interferon alpha do not have a sustained response with clearance of the virus. The molecular mechanisms underlying interferon resistance are poorly understood. Interferon-induced activation of the Jak-STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) signal transduction pathway is essential for the induction of an antiviral state. Interference of viral proteins with the Jak-STAT pathway could be responsible for interferon resistance in patients with chronic HCV. We have analyzed interferon-induced signal transduction through the Jak-STAT pathway in transgenic mice that express HCV proteins in their liver cells. STAT activation was investigated with Western blots, immunofluorescence, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Virus challenge experiments with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus were used to demonstrate the functional importance of Jak-STAT inhibition. STAT signaling was found to be strongly inhibited in liver cells of HCV transgenic mice. The inhibition occurred in the nucleus and blocked binding of STAT transcription factors to the promoters of interferon-stimulated genes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins by Janus kinases at the interferon receptor was not inhibited. This lack in interferon response resulted in an enhanced susceptibility of the transgenic mice to infection with a hepatotropic strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.",Does expression of hepatitis c virus proteins inhibit interferon alpha signaling in the liver of transgenic mice?,Interferon-induced intracellular signaling is impaired in HCV transgenic mice.

"Norcantharidin, a modified pure compound from blister beetles, was previously demonstrated to induce apoptosis of cancer cells. This study investigated its anti-cancer activity in prostate cancer cells and the mechanisms involved. Two human prostate cancer cell lines, 22Rv1 and Du145, were treated with norcantharidin at concentrations ranging from 3 to 30μg/ml. Cytotoxic effect of norcantharidin was determined by use of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-yl)-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. The effects of apoptosis were evaluated by cell death assay, Caspase-3, -8, -9 activity and cytochrome c release. The apoptotic related protein expressions (Bcl-2 family and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) were determined using western blotting. An MTT assay revealed that norcantharidin induced cytotoxicity against both prostate cancer cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. Treatment with norcantharidin at 3μg/ml or higher significantly increased oligonucleosomal formation with concomitant appearance of PARP cleavage, implicating the induction of apoptosis. Norcantharidin intrinsically elevated cytosolic cytochrome c levels and activated caspase-3, -8, and -9. Extrinsically, it upregulated the expression of not only the death receptors Fas and DR5 in 22Rv1 cells, but also of RIP and TRADD adaptor proteins in Du145 cells.

"Laparoscopic hernia repair with percutaneous ligation of the patent processes vaginalis is a minimally invasive alternative to open inguinal herniorrhaphy in children. With the camera port concealed at the umbilicus, this technique offers an excellent cosmetic result. It is also faster than the traditional laparoscopic repair with no differences in complication rates or hospital stay. The goal of this study was to describe a series of consecutive patients, emphasizing the impact of suture materials (absorbable vs. non-absorbable) on hernia recurrences. A retrospective review was performed of consecutive transperitoneal laparoscopic subcutaneous ligations of a symptomatic hernia and/or communicating hydrocele by 4 surgeons. Patients > Tanner 2 or with prior hernia repair were excluded. The success of the procedure and number of sutures used was compared between cases performed with absorbable vs. non-absorbable suture. Risk factors for surgical failure (age, weight, number of sutures used, suture type) were assessed with logistic regression. 94 patients underwent laparoscopic percutaneous hernia ligation at a mean age of 4.9 years.

"Hepatic ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major complication of liver transplantation and resectional hepatic surgeries. Natural killer T (NKT) cells predominate in liver, where they recognize lipid antigens bound to CD1d molecules. Type I NKT cells use a semi-invariant T-cell receptor and react with α-galactosylceramide; type II NKT cells use diverse T-cell receptors. Some type II NKT cells recognize the self-glycolipid sulfatide. It is not clear whether or how these distinct NKT cell subsets mediate hepatocellular damage after IRI. We examined the roles of type I and type II NKT cells in mice with partial hepatic, warm ischemia, and reperfusion injury. Mice that lack type I NKT cells (Jα18-/-) were protected from hepatic IRI, indicated by reduced hepatocellular necrosis and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase. Sulfatide-mediated activation of type II NKT cells reduced interferon-γ secretion by type I NKT cells and prevented IRI. Protection from hepatic IRI by sulfatide-mediated inactivation of type I NKT cells was associated with significant reductions in hepatic recruitment of myeloid cell subsets, especially the CD11b(+)Gr-1(int), Gr-1(-), and NK cells.",Does sulfatide-mediated activation of type II natural killer T cells prevent hepatic ischemic reperfusion injury in mice?,"In mice, subsets of NKT cells have opposing roles in hepatic IRI: type I NKT cells promote injury whereas sulfatide-reactive type II NKT cells protect against injury.

"Palonosetron is a recently introduced 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist useful for postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis. However, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists increase the corrected QT (QTc) interval in patients who undergo general anesthesia. This retrospective study was performed to evaluate whether palonosetron would induce a QTc prolongation in patients undergoing general anesthesia with sevoflurane. We reviewed a database of 81 patients who underwent general anesthesia with sevoflurane. We divided the records into palonosetron (n = 41) and control (n = 40) groups according to the use of intraoperative palonosetron, and analyzed the electrocardiographic data before anesthesia and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after skin incision. Changes in the QTc interval from baseline, mean blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and sevoflurane concentrations at each time point were compared between the two groups. The QTc intervals at skin incision, and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the skin incision during general anesthesia were significantly longer than those at baseline in the two groups (P < 0.001). The changes in the QTc intervals were not different between the two groups (P = 0.41). However, six patients in the palonosetron group showed a QTc interval > 500 ms 30 min after skin incision, whereas no patient did in the control group (P = 0.01).

"Sensory gating deficit, assessed by a paired auditory stimulus paradigm (P50), has been reported as a stable marker of schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to explore if this neurophysiological disturbance also fulfilled stability criteria in the bipolar disorder (BD) spectrum bipolar, as state independence is one of the main points to be considered as a potential endophenotype of the illness. The P50 evoked potential was studied in 95 healthy controls and 126 bipolar euthymic patients. Euthymia was established according to Van Gorp's criteria. Bipolar I and II subtypes were analyzed separately. The influence of a lifetime history of psychoses was also evaluated in the clinical sample. P50 gating was deficitary in all the subsamples of patients relative to healthy comparison subjects. Bipolar I patients with and without a history of psychosis showed higher P50 ratios than the other subgroups of patients, although these differences were not significant.

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is largely incurable due to late diagnosis. Superior early detection biomarkers are critical to improving PDAC survival and risk stratification. Optimized meta-analysis of PDAC transcriptome datasets identified and validated key PDAC biomarkers. PDAC-specific expression of a 5-gene biomarker panel was measured by qRT-PCR in microdissected patient-derived FFPE tissues. Cell-based assays assessed impact of two of these biomarkers, TMPRSS4 and ECT2, on PDAC cells. A 5-gene PDAC classifier (TMPRSS4, AHNAK2, POSTN, ECT2, SERPINB5) achieved on average 95% sensitivity and 89% specificity in discriminating PDAC from non-tumor samples in four training sets and similar performance (sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 89.6%) in five independent validation datasets. This classifier accurately discriminated PDAC from chronic pancreatitis (AUC = 0.83), other cancers (AUC = 0.89), and non-tumor from PDAC precursors (AUC = 0.92) in three independent datasets. Importantly, the classifier distinguished PanIN from healthy pancreas in the PDX1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D PDAC mouse model. Discriminatory expression of the PDAC classifier genes was confirmed in microdissected FFPE samples of PDAC and matched surrounding non-tumor pancreas or pancreatitis.

"The potential to modulate the inflammatory response has renewed interest in hypertonic saline (HTS) resuscitation of injured patients. However, the effect of the timing of HTS treatment with respect to polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) priming and activation remains unexplored.

"Equine recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) is a bilateral mononeuropathy with an unknown pathogenesis that significantly affects performance in Thoroughbreds. A genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of RLN is suggested by the higher prevalence of the condition in offspring of RLN-affected than unaffected stallions. To better understand RLN pathogenesis and its genetic basis, we performed a genome-wide association (GWAS) of 282 RLN-affected and 268 control Thoroughbreds. We found a significant association of RLN with the LCORL/NCAPG locus on ECA3 previously shown to affect body size in horses. Using height at the withers of 505 of these horses, we confirmed the strong association of this locus with body size, and demonstrated a significant phenotypic and genetic correlation between height and RLN grade in this cohort. Secondary genetic associations for RLN on ECA18 and X did not correlate with withers height in our cohort, but did contain candidate genes likely influencing muscle physiology and growth: myostatin (MSTN) and integral membrane protein 2A (ITM2A).",Does genomic analysis establish correlation between growth and laryngeal neuropathy in Thoroughbreds?,"This linkage between body size and RLN suggests that selective breeding to reduce RLN prevalence would likely reduce adult size in this population. However, our results do not preclude the possibility of modifier loci that attenuate RLN risk without reducing size or performance, or that the RLN risk allele is distinct but tightly linked to the body size locus on ECA3.

"Rectal distension is known to induce numerous upper gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of rectal distension on small intestinal myoelectrical and motor activities in 8 dogs using a pair of intestinal electrodes and an intestinal fistula. Experiment 1 entailed a 30-min baseline recording and a 30-min recording during rectal balloon distension at various volumes (60, 80, 100 and 120 ml) randomly. Experiment 2 comprised three sessions, each including a 30-min baseline recording, a 20-min recording after intravenous infusion of saline, phentolamine (3 mg/kg) or propranolol (3 mg/kg), respectively, and another 30-min recording during rectal balloon distending. 1) Rectal distension resulted in reduced intestinal motility in a dose-dependent manner (r=0.68, p<0.001). 2) The reduction in intestinal motility was significantly diminished when infusions of phentolamine (2.7+/-1.0 versus 8.4+/-1.5, p<0.01) or propranolol (3.7+/-1.4 versus 8.4+/-1.5, p<0.05) were given, suggesting partial involvement of the alpha- and beta-adrenergic pathways. 3) Rectal distension did not affect the percentage of normal 17-22 cycles/min intestinal slow waves (97.5+/-2.5 versus 93.0+/-5.3, p>0.05), or their dominant frequency (17.2+/-1.2 counts per minute (cpm) versus 17.7+/-1.0 cpm, p>0.05), or dominant power (-4.8+/-2.5 versus -8.2+/-2.9 dB, p>0.05).",Does rectal distension inhibit postprandial small intestinal motor activity partially via the adrenergic pathway in dogs?,"Rectal distension inhibits postprandial small intestinal motor activity in a distension volume-dependent manner in dogs, and this inhibitory effect is at least partially mediated via the alpha and beta adrenergic pathways and does not involve any alterations in intestinal slow waves.",1,"1.

"Cartilage destruction in osteoarthritis (OA) is generally accepted as a failed repair process. Cell adhesion is implicated in tissue repair. Therefore, adhesion of OA chondrocytes to extracellular matrix proteins was investigated. Using chondrocytes from human OA femoral head cartilage, adhesion to fibronectin and type II collagen of cells from distinct areas showing an intact cartilage surface or a fibrillated cartilage surface was studied. Modulation of chondrocyte adhesion by both protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and glucosamine sulfate (GS) was also investigated. A significant (P < 0.05) decrease in adhesion to fibronectin of chondrocytes from fibrillated cartilage, relative to those from grossly normal OA cartilage, was demonstrated. Adhesion to type II collagen was not modified by the chondrocyte origins (either from normal or fibrillated OA cartilage). Adhesion to fibronectin of cells from grossly intact cartilage was decreased by the addition of PKC and calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibitors, W7 and sphingosine, to the cell culture.

"The relationship between genetic variation in gene expression and phenotypic variation observable in nature is not well understood. Identifying how many phenotypes are associated with differences in gene expression and how many gene-expression differences are associated with a phenotype is important to understanding the molecular basis and evolution of complex traits. We compared levels of gene expression among nine natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown either in the presence or absence of copper sulfate. Of the nine strains, two show a reduced growth rate and two others are rust colored in the presence of copper sulfate. We identified 633 genes that show significant differences in expression among strains. Of these genes, 20 were correlated with resistance to copper sulfate and 24 were correlated with rust coloration. The function of these genes in combination with their expression pattern suggests the presence of both correlative and causative expression differences. But the majority of differentially expressed genes were not correlated with either phenotype and showed the same expression pattern both in the presence and absence of copper sulfate.

"This study sought to evaluate the outcome and prevalence of viral endomyocardial infection after cardiac transplantation. Viral myocardial infection causes heart failure, but its role after cardiac transplantation is unclear. We hypothesized that viral infection of the cardiac allograft reduces graft survival. Between June 1999 and November 2004, 94 pediatric cardiac transplant patients were screened for the presence of viral genome in serial endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Graft loss, advanced transplant coronary artery disease (TCAD), and acute rejection (AR) were compared in the PCR-positive (n = 37) and PCR-negative (n = 57) groups, using time-dependent Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. From November 2002 to November 2004, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) was administered to patients with PCR-positive EMBs. The outcomes of the IVIG-treated, PCR-positive patients (n = 20) were compared with IVIG-untreated, PCR-positive patients (n = 17).
